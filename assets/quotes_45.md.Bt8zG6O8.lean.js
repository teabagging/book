They ask the computer 'what is the answer to life and everything'then the computer answers'i cant answer this question you must build a smarter computer then me''. The computer gives them the plans on how to build it. Finally after they built it they asked again what is the answer to life and the computer said it needed 200,000 years to think.Wow, now again the great great great great great grand children of those rats came and the computers answer was 42. Everyone was in awe and could not understand it. I was laughing for ever it was so random and funny.This book was very funny to me but it was hard to read, i pesonally loved this book at times and hated it at times. i would recomend this book to people who like nepolean dynamite or monty python. If you like random books that dont have to have a point and are funny then this is for you. But if your looking for more of a serious book with a theme and climax then i would not recomend this book. Also this book has some hard big words in it so i would not recomend it for people in elementry or middle school unless your a really accelerated reader. So like i said before it really depends on what kind of reader you are do you like books with lots of funny moments that make no sense at all. Or a book with a actual point to it if so you will hate this book it will make you bang your head against the wall trying to understand what just happened and why, every page you read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As the late writer Douglas Adams explains in the introduction \\"A Guide to the Guide\\" (\\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide\\" edition) \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" has appeared in different forms and in different medias -- not two of them are alike. That is very interesting and one more proof of the author's apparently unstoppable creativity. You may not enjoy either his sense of humor, or his ideas, but you can't deny he is smart and creative.I approached \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is suspicion. I have never been very fond of science fiction -- and I never understood all those complicated physical and mathematical stuff--, I have always preferred something more intellectual. And I wasn't sure how comedy would work along with science fiction. To make matters worse, I've never got into books that are published in series, and become a fever, with people who can discuss them as if they were talking about the weather. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a nightmare for me. So I decided to read Adam's first book and see what happens.Little did I know that I would fall for it before I reached page 20. In other words, before Earth is destructed. Although I can't recommend the whole series yet, I have to confess that I loved the first book and found it one of the funniest things I've ever read. And, it is not an easy job to make me laugh. Adams is witty and fast. So are his characters -- albeit a little crazy.My favorite character certainly is Marvin, the bipolar robot -- or paranoid android, pick one. He has some of the funniest lines in the novel. At some point, the reader may wonder whether he/she (the reader) is really crazy or Marvin is really involuntarily funny. I'd pick the second. My second favorite character is Ed, the hyperactive computer. These machines are dead funny.One can't expect realism in a science fiction comedy. Since \\"The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy\\" is a fantasy, it is not a heresy to find a robot and a computer with more feelings that human beings or talking mice. This is supposed to entertain and, after all, this is food for thought, raising questions about what life is about, what is happening to the Earth and things like that. At some point, why not consider this novel sort of eco friendly?\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a sort of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" written by \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"'s Lewis Carroll. Strange creatures act as if they were not strange; unusual situations are tackled as if they were usual; and a towel is the most important thing one must carry. What a (wonderful) world!I'll certainly read the following books in the series. I only hope they are as good, as funny, as witty and as fast as \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". This light book is a good choice to read between to heavy and highbrow books. This is certainly one of the best treats readers any age can have."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There are books that you should read, re-read, and re-re-read. This, unfortunately, turned out not to be one of those books, at least for me.When I first read this as a teenager, the whimsical English humor, sudden digressions, metafictional interruptions, and probing satirical questions kept me in stitches. This novel (such as it is), held together by a singular smart-assery, profoundly appealed to my own new found sense of adolescent rebellion. Coincidences, meaningful and otherwise, non sequiturs, and bureaucratic balderdash leavened the side-splitting dialogue and made it impossible to put down.Alas, upon re-reading the novel at the conclusion of 2006, I was struck by how much of the writing didn't strike me anymore. To say that the plot of the book is thin would be a compliment, and to call the characters, well, characters, would be a stretch. Most of the jokes just weren't as funny this time around, and the few that did crack me up were tinged with the bittersweet recognition that they would never be groundbreaking again.Because I read the 25th anniversary edition, perhaps it is fitting that it conjured up such mixed emotions. The author, Douglas Adams, had died three years before this edition was published, and so many of the extras in this volume involve tributes from luminaries like Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The introductory chapters are also chocked full of reproductions of flyers, book covers, and other such emphemera that will only be important to die-hard fans of the book, radio show, and/or movie.Remember, though, that this review is just my opinion. Whatever you do, Don't Panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's not really my place to judge a classic that is older than I am, but I didn't find this all too exciting. The story itself was rather dry and predictable and so was the humor. If you like British humor, than this is definitely for you. I don't know, I guess I was expecting more realistic science fiction, in which case this book certainly doesn't deliver. In short, think Monty Python + Outer Space + A couple hits of Acid."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"42[okay, that's not a word, but you get my point]"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's Thursday.

Well, I finally read it. Overall it's not quite as good as I hoped, but still it was an interesting read.H2G2 is about an Earthling named Arthur Dent who is saved right at the last second by his friend from a planet near Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect. Ford convinces Arthur that the Earth is being destroyed and just in time they are saved by accident. This is the beginning of this wild (and I mean wild!) ride. Along this ride you meet some interesting characters including talking mice, a 2-headed, 3-armed ex-hippie president of the galaxy, a depressed robot and others.There's a lot to like about this book, but you have to enjoy this particular genre of comedy. For me the book was fairly interesting throughout, I was always curious about what craziness lurked on the pages that follow, however, oftentimes I was let down a bit and it's because a lot of the scenes in the book are just too crazy and they seem too random.I wont give away anything major but there are scenes such as Ford jamming a fish that translates languages in to Arthurs ear, rockets that turn into a whale and a bowl of petunias just before impact and absolute madness that involves ball-point pens. Douglas Adams is a good writer so he is able to paint these scenes in an interesting way. There are definitely a few scenes in the book that made me smirk, but overall I just didn't find much humor. It's almost as if you had a really good author, gave him a few hits of LSD and told him to write a book before he sobered up. I can see how this style of comedy is interesting to some people, but I guess it's just not my flavor.Perhaps I just don't have a very good sense of humor. Definitely check this book out though, there are so many people that really love this style of comedy and if you are one of these people then I'm sure you will find a lot of great laughs."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is a human on earth and Ford Perfect is an alien from a different planet. Ford had the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy witch told the Visigoths were going to blowup the earth for an express root. So Ford and Arthur hitched a ride from the Visigoths, and they didn't like hitchhikers. So the Visigoths throw out them in to space and Ford's friend Zaphod Beedlebrox who had two heads peaked them up. And Zaphod was with Arthur's friend Trillian. Arthur and Ford where in a room in their ship, and Trillian sent Marvin a depressed robot to get them. They reunited and they went to planet to get an improbability drive. And Zaphod had to give him one of his heads so Zaphod would get him a gun. Zaphod couldn't think with his one head. And on the planet the Visigoths captured Trillian. So Arthur, Ford, and Zaphod went to free her, and left the Vogon. And went to a planet called magrotha and on the planet they went to a super computer to find the meaning of life.And on the planet Arthur left behind went Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian went though a portal. So Arthur met a guy were he was. This was a contractor who built planets. So this man took Arthur around the planets they where building. Arthur found out that the built earth. Mice paid for it and designed it. So the man took Arthur to his home. When Arthur walked in the door Ford, Trillion, and Aphid was there. Then they fell a sleep and Arthur was awake and the mice.

If you do not wish to have those points revealed, PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER.Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (THGttG) begins innocently enough with the pending destruction of Arthur Dent's home outside of London, England. The only thing keeping the wrecking crew from demolishing the house is his lying in front of their heavy equipment. It seems that the &quot;powers that be&quot; wish to knock down his house to make way for a much needed highway bypass. Arthur's one-man lie-in is interrupted by a visit from his friend Ford Prefect, an out of work actor. Unknown to Arthur, Ford Prefect is actually an alien field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Ford has been accidentally exiled on Earth for the past 15 years.Arthur, with the aid of Ford Prefect, stows away on board the starship sent to destroy the Earth. It seems that our planet is in the right-of-way for the new hyper-spatial bypass. After stowing away, the following bizarre events happen in rapid succession: Ford and Arthur are tortured by bad poetry, they are hurled into the vacuum of space, they are rescued from said vacuum by Zaphod Beeblebrox (the renegade Galactic President) and his sidekick Trillian (the only other surviving Earth human). Needless to say these turn of events lead to some very interesting and very funny reading.I liked THGttG. I didn't love it but I did like it. This is my second reading of the novel in 10 years. THGttG was an enjoyable if not a light almost fluffy read. Adams' light and bouncy writing style made it easy to breeze through the text. I finished the book over a 2-day period. Adams' dialogue and scene descriptions were punchy and witty, much like radio dialogue from which it was taken. The book's humor is definitely British (funny bordering on the absurd). Watchers of British comedies will know what I mean by this assertion. If fact, as I read I would hear John Cleese's (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers) voice in my head doing the narration.Although I enjoyed the book's style and tone, its story was not as enjoyable or at least not as satisfying as it should have been. At a novel's conclusion I expect most if not all questions raised during the narrative to be answered. This didn't happen with THGttG. The book left many important questions unanswered: What happens to Slartibartfast, the caretaker of Magrathea? Do the Authorities ever catch Zaphod and punish him for stealing the Heart of Gold? Why were his brains surgically altered anyway? What is the question for which &quot;42&quot; is the answer? What will the mice do now? I saw the Public Television mini-series (a combination of THGttG and it's sequel The Restaurant at the End of Time) when it came out in the Eighties, so I know the answers to my own questions. But for the readers who have not seen the series not answering these questions is too great a flaw to overlook.All in all, THGttG is an enjoyable book because of its wit and humor but it leaves too much to be desired when it comes to tying up loose ends. If you wish to enjoy the book and understand what everything in it means, read THGttG and The Restaurant at the End of Time in immediate succession. If not, you'll find yourself greatly disappointed. ---------- Mario N.

Full of futuristic gimmicks, some funny and some, well, just plain silly, including Marvin the Paranoid Android, who just by talking to a ship computer causes it to commit suicide is pretty much the humor involved. Although the plot is pretty much nonsense, it is an entertaining read. Things like the meaning of life being the number 42 are what make this book either hilarious or nonsensical.

One of these friends is from outer space and the other one does not know it. A spaceship apears and is going to blow up earth, so the friends hitch a ride with the spaceship and travel off into space.My favorite part of the book is in the begining, when the town wants to knock down Arthur's house and the costruction workers are outside his house wating to knock it down. Then his friend Ford comes and tells him that they need to talk but, Arthur does not want to move. So Ford confuses him and gets the head construction worker to take Arthur's spot and lay in the mud in front of the house until they get back. Next Ford brings Arthur to the bar and tells him that the world is going to get blown up by aliens.I don't recommend this book. For any body under the age of 15 or 16 because it was confuising and hard to follow. Most of the jokes I did not get and the ones I did get weren't that funny.

The story is OK, but nothing groundbreaking, aliens and earthlings adventuring through space. And as for climax...this book ends so suddenly, I wasn't even sure what the whole point was. Nothing was tied up or remedied. Characters didn't change or evolve, more than a few questions went completely unanswered. I guess this book is part of a series. It's best feature...it's short, so I didn't waste much time, and now I can say I've read it, for whatever that's worth.

Adams' ability to weave such convoluted subplots into a final big picture is absolutely amazing. He has been criticized for this, but I've found these critics often do not have the patience and/or comprehension level to really understand the _point_ Adams' is often trying to get across Regardless, the result of weaving all these microcosmic views of the world together is both a celebration and a criticism of our small human lives on Earth...and we have the priviledge of laughing all the way through it.

Hard to argue with that."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"The Subjection of Women is an often overlooked classic by one of history's greatest minds. Published at the end of Mill's life, The Subjection brings together all of Mill's most important views on liberty, utility, human nature, and society. It paints a far more accessable ethic than more famous works, such as On Liberty. Mill uses his philosophical views to reach conclusions that were long ahead of his time, and in many ways continue to outpace our understanding of gender and society. This work is arguably the best feminist writing ever, and the best commentary on morality and social evolution.Today, Mill's work continues to provide us with a framework for understanding social movements such as the gay rights and animal rights movements. Mill shows us how just institutions are vital to the happiness of both society and the individual, as these institutions are central to the formation of our characters. He shows us how both the oppressor and the oppressed are harmed by unjust institutional arrangements, such as gender inequalities in the family. In sum, Mill's The Subjection of Women is perhaps the finest piece of social and political philosophy produced in the modern era, and should be read by all interested in social justice, feminism, or ethics."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"A founding document of modern feminism by the granddaddy of libertarian thought.

I believe that the subjection of women is one of the best arguments for equality of genders that has ever been written. beyond the usual cited feminist arguments that pervade pop culture, this book using reason argues that not only are women disadvantage by society unequal treatment, but MEN are too. Society is deprived of what they might have achieved, and we are all the lesser for it. Although written a hundred years ago, the ideas still have not been taken to heart by society. If more people read this book, the culture would be better off."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"The Subjection of Women deals exclusively with a subject John Stuart Mill had often touched on previously - female oppression. This classic essay is the culmination of an issue Mill had been passionately involved in since youth, when he was arrested for distributing literature about contraception. It is the most important, famous, and influential feminist text between Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, coming about halfway between them. That it was written by a man, one born to a substantial amount of privilege and who was around very few women until adulthood at that, is of course all the more incredible. Going well beyond his prior suffrage call, it pushes for nothing less than full equality, not even stopping at legal equality but valiantly trying to change thought and custom. Mill's suffrage arguments are numerous and near-irrefutable. He has the noble distinction of being the first MP to propose female suffrage - in the 1860s! He would surely be glad to know the substantial progress since made, however disappointed - if not surprised - he may have been to know it would take sixty years to be realized.However, the vast majority of the essay deals with the rest of female oppression, a far more formidable barrier - one that, indeed, has sadly still not been fully crossed. The arguments are again very strong. Following a short historical overview of female oppression and a blunt survey of its then current forms, Mill proceeds to demolish its basis. In perhaps the most brilliant and admirable application of utilitarianism ever, he convincingly shows that female oppression is not only a great evil to women but also to men and all of society. He uses many examples and arguments to show that ending it is both a moral necessity and a prescription for many social ills. The many later advances have proven much of what he said, even if he was perhaps too optimistic in some respects. It is a sad comment on human progress that several of the ideals he passionately and articulately argued for, such as equality of intellect in marriage, are still uncommon and even scorned.Though Subjection is admitted even by Mill's many detractors to be his argumentative tour de force, it has a few limitations. First, one of his main arguments is that Victorian - nay, all historical - assumptions about inherent differences between men and women, as well as the latter's inferiority, are premature because women had never existed in a state of social equality with men. This is certainly true as far as it goes - indeed, irrefutable at the time. Though he argues forcefully for equality in any situation, he does not even address the substantial question of what, if anything, should or must be done if inherent differences are found. This defect was then nothing more than abstract and, in fact, very subservient to the cause of advancing female rights. However, the near-equality women now have in developed countries means we must look at the issue somewhat differently. The question of inherent differences, much less relative superiority, is still far from answered - may indeed be even less clear. Even so, many of the issues Mill left unaddressed because moot are now very real, even pressing. They may leave his central arguments untouched - one would in fact be very hard-pressed to find a better argument for female equality anywhere -, but the essay is certainly more incomplete now, though still substantially valuable. Finally, though Mill's liberalism on the question is almost unbelievable for a man of his time and place, some of his statements and suggestions, not least his claim that the arrangement of man as breadwinner/woman as domestic engineer - to use the (I believe) currently politically correct term - probably is best after all, will rankle current feminists. To be fair, he does not say it prescriptively - indeed refrains from ruling anything out for women in any respect -, but Victorianism's ugly specter sneaking in even here is bound to disturb some. This of course hardly negates the rest, and The Subjection is still - and surely always will be - essential for anyone even remotely interested in women's struggle."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"Interesting little book. I understand maybe that his wife helped him write it, or they collaborated. It ranges through history, politics and economics and although I enjoyed the book, I cannot help but feel his view of history is weak and his economics dreadful.These weaknesses aside, he makes a compelling case for the equality of women and his discussion of contemporary (to him) life issues of women is fascinating.He ends the book with a section on the difficulty of relationships between men and women when the women are not liberated. I think it is the high point of the book."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"Mill argues his position in a compelling and heartfelt manner. He was a true progressive. Much of his argument is still applicable today."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"I have to say that I found The Subjection of Women to be surprisingly accessible and very interesting. As the book was written in 1869, and as I tend to have difficulty reading classics, I imagined that this would be a trying read for me. While it wasnft the most fun book Ifve ever read, it was a much more enjoyable experience than I was expecting! I was pleasantly surprised by how progressive Millfs opinions were on the subject of womenfs rights and equality. Of particular interest to me was the fact that he mentioned the social construction of gender multiple times throughout the book. While he didnft use the phrase gsocial construction of genderh (of course) he blatantly stated that men gareh a certain way and women gareh another way because society tells men and women how to behave and think, and people tend to act accordingly. While anyone who has taken Womenfs Studies 101 or even read a basic feminist text will be able to explain this nowadays, I didnft expect to read about someone having a solid understanding of that concept in the mid-1800s. Overall, this was a pleasant reading experience and I would definitely recommend The Subjection of Women as an important feminist classic."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"The cruel past of mankind is the framework for all existing inequalities past and present, proclaims John Stuart Mill in his passionate defense of the equality between men and women.Natural conditionThe only natural condition of the human race was the law of the strongest. A physical fact (strength) became a legal right. Inequality of rights was the publicly and openly avowed rule of life.Mankind was divided in two classes: a small one of masters and a numerous one of slaves.Human society was based on the principle of a fixed place (where one was born) and a fixed social position. The least possible was left to the choice of the individual. All those who resisted the authorities had all laws and all notions of social obligation against them.FamilyAfter the abolition of slavery, no official slaves remained, except the mistress in every house. The family still reflects the initial \`natural' state of inequality. It is a school for despotism with unrestrained power at home for the head of the family in his role of absolute sovereign.New lawsThe legal subordination of one sex to the other must be replaced by a principle of perfect equality. The most universal and pervading of all human relations (marriage) should be regulated by justice. The laws (and institutions) should be adapted to \`bad' men, not to \`good' ones.Merit, not birth, is the rightful claim to power and authority.The free use of women's faculties would double the mass of mental faculties available for the service of mankind.In this forceful diatribe, which is still highly topical in major parts of our \`modern' world, John Stuart Mill extended the goal of his brilliant essay \\"On Liberty' to the concrete position of one half of the world's population.It is a must read for all those interested in mankind and its history."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"A powerful articulation of why we should all want equality for all people. Still highly relevant. Some of it may seem somewhat dated but only because we live in western society. I am mainly referring to his arguments that women should be allowed to own their own property and have legal equality and such. This is still a relevant point for women in many countries though. He refutes many objections to the equal treatment of women many of which I still hear or read today. Like that women aren't suited to many occupations either because of their physical or mental natures. I won't restate those arguments here but they are beautifully, passionately laid out and it is well worth the read. I have only read On Liberty and it is good but this was deeply moving and it is hard to imagine that he has written anything better than this."},{"Title":"The subjection of women","review":"I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class.

In Volume I now out of print the images were more uniform of the individual flowers. In this Volume II, she comes in for an even closer look at the petals, the serrations, the stems, and the stamens and pistils, allowing us, the voyeur viewer, to appreciate the 'sexuality' of the flowers.The color is extraordinary and the 'anthropomorphic' suggestions she creates in the placement of the flower parts on the page suggest, or rather depict, the means by which flowers are propagated. The results are some very sensuous images along with the magnificent beauty of bud to full performance of the blooms she selects to share. Bordnick wisely keeps the commentary to a minimum and that allows the viewer to travel through the flora kingdom undaunted by verbal descriptions. This is a very beautiful coffee table book!

There are several very fun characters in this novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, author Jane Austen tells us in the very first sentence, was handsome, clever, and rich, and blessed with a happy disposition. In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often. In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue. Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith. In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.The comedy ripples through every chapter. Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners. Along the way, the reader will be treated to Emma's education in life, a worthwhile journey with an interesting ending. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is somewhat of a flip from Pride and Prejudice. Not as good, but still worth reading. Emma is the privileged one in her society and as she tries helping a less fortunate friend find love, she discovers that she is not as wise as she once thought. With a steady flow of characters and a great growth depiction in Emma, I just might read this again.The beginning dragged on a bit, you really have to get past 60% before anything particularly interesting happens, and I even really disliked Emma at first. However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions. Don't read for a fast moving story, but if you want something that is relaxing and refreshing, Emma is your thing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Beautiful Deluxe Edition!

My teacher loved it and boasted about it's greatness. I was very disturbed because, I read it.....got through the first four chapters and went into a coma.... BORING! This story not only lacks any action or plot of sorts but insists on spending copious amounts of pages on meaningless blabber. I had to make a summary of the novel. It took only 1 page. My teahcer could not criticise my summary. I had covered EVERYTHING in the novel! I found Emma to be one of the most irritating characters ever created, for those who boldly state she is the greatest 'heroine', I will say, Joan of Ark was a heroine, Mary mother of Jesus was a heroine, Mother Teresa was a heroine, EMMA is a pretentios, self absorbed, controling, spoilt, BORING individual and should be left in her time and not studied in ours.

As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible!

And boy did I have to push myself to finish it ! Like another reviewer said: it looks like a blueprint of the movie Clueless. But less funny and al lot more boring.But maybe I'm being to harsh on Jane Austen. Not all books survive the teeth of time like Pride and Prejudice. If that is what life was like for a lot of high class girls in the early 19th century, than I am so gratefull that I'm born at the end of the 20th century !!! Miss Bates monologues were kinda funny the first few times, but after that... The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies.We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good.Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences.

Yeah, so maybe I don't feel like 'hard reading' but it doesn't leave much to the imagination, and I'm a person who likes to have my imagination do the driving. The other reason I didn't particularly like the book - well, I don't get my kicks from reading about manipulative, immature women, which is my opinion of Emma. Manipulative, because she assumes it's her right to make matches, immature because she doesn't see anything wrong with it, especially when she's confronted with it. she has the 'i'm always right' feeling you'll sometimes find in a five year old.

I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television, or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know when I'm going to be finished.And this is coming from someone who studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However, a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push through some dialogue that runs longer than one page.As for what the book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma complete illustrated novel by Jane AustenAusten's witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful.

It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on withlittle thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works. She is the indisputed queen of romance fiction and is as popular today as she was when the book was published in 1816. This fall Masterpiece Theatre will be airing dramatizations of all six novels. We Janeites are a growing army of devoted fans. Jane only wrote 6 books but each is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment. Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives.While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another. In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance.In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit. Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love.Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father. Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school. The plot revolves around Emma\`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men. Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.Several young couples court and become engaged in the course of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts. Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most. She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior. What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting butdoddering father.This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present. The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix. Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda. Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings andrelationships? Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders? EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a must read for Austen fans. Filled with the wit, the scandal, the light-hearted fun and the 17th century morals we have come to expect. Yet Emma is no Lizzie, and if you are expecting it to live up to Pride and Prejudice you will be disappointed. Not her best work but worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma, written by Jane Austen is story about a clever, rich, and high society woman, named Emma Woodhouse. Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma.Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love.In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams.In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a great classic novel and probably one of Jane Austen's best! If you like this book I also suggest the wonderful movie adaptations. Both the one starring Gwynneth Paltrow and the one starring Kate Beckinsale are quite lovely!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress ir vex her.\\"So begins Jane Austen's classic novel of the mishaps of matchmaking. Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess.The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma.Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being. She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well. For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result. Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.Of course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\" The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which!The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist. I definitely recommend it, but to at least a freshman in high school, because it is a challenging book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"i absolutely love this novel.

I first read it when I was about seventeen, and I loved it as much this time as I did then. It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable. Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings. And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice. After completing Emma for the second time, I'm eager to pick up her other books and lose myself in her enchanting narrative."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"At age 13, I found the language challenging, but today at 17 I find it delightful. Nothing agrees with me more than rereading my now favorite book. Though the language is challenging for a young or first time Jane Austin reader it is well worth wading through the odd words and strange grammer to see into the heart of the story.The story touches so close to my heart it is a pleasure to read and dream of that someday romance with me in the place of any one of Austin's ladies. Now if I can find a man as gentlemanly, handsome and kind as Mr. Kingley."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love reading romance novels from 18th century and Emma kept me glued to my kindle. It is a long book, but worth every page."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Just to note: This review is of the Almost Sunday Publishing kindle edition.If you are like me, you want to buy books at the cheapest price you can get, while still getting good quality. Good news! The kindle version of this book is flawless as far as I can tell. It is simply the text, with chapters that you can jump to. There are NO annoying pictures among the text at all.The story itself is VERY good, and easy to read even though it was written over 200 years ago. I found it very amusing to read Emma's antics, and I could definitely relate to her and the other characters. For more on the plot, you can easy look at the other versions.The bottom-line is if you are looking for Austen for a low price, this one is the way to go!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Out of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters. The wonders, complications, and misunderstandings of love and marriage are told brilliantly in this entertaining novel!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A wonderful read! This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty. And why not, since she is of a social standing where she feels she's entitled to look down on those inferior to her position. Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Siri Amster- OlszewskiAugust 24, 2006Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well. The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those timesI was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time. It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage. For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love. In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status. One could not marry below their status. Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I admit, it has been a few years since I read Emma. I haven't gotten to read the rest of Austen's works (yet!), but I think she is a fine writer. As a writer, that's a high compliment. I don't mean to say she's, well, fine.. I mean she is fine and honed and respectable.. and great.I picked this book up at my library when I was tired of random teen angst-based novels about first boyfriends and horrible pasts. I wanted something written with real language, with a style. I wanted something old and truly good, like the classics I had read and been read as a young child. I wanted something with SUBSTANCE.Because of this, it took me awhile to get back in the habit of really reading. For a week or so, Emma lay in a drawer, only partway read. It was difficult not to skim and my head would swim with the small print and dark pages. I lamented, but shrugged it off as life got busy.I came out of the shower one day, with an urge to get back into it, and ended up standing, hair wet, in front of my dresser, book rooted up out of the confines of my underthings, and wasting time.I read it constantly until I finished it, as I always do when reading a new book, but this one was different. This one invoked a hunger in me, and I was definitely satisfied when it came to an end.The constant little subplots and dramas surrounding arrogant, but rather good-natured Emma, the engaging characters, with such distinct and memorable personalities, and the wonderful twist of the ending (everyone else says they were so sure, but I, for one, was surprised, I admit) were all...wonderful. Austen is, I say again, a fine writer, and no wonder she is of the classics.I have heard, as well, that she did not think anyone else would love Emma. I ask, how could you not? The people who are so vehement about her flaws clearly have many of the same. She is one of the most enjoyable heroines I have had the pleasure of visiting, among such \\"flawed\\" characters as Anne Shirley (her incessant daydreaming and such a temper! ;), in all my years of reading. And that's a very long time."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen perfects the art of character development in Emma. The long, twisted plot carefully and slowly develops each character using rich detail that makes the characters come alive with personality. Without the rich detail and character development, I do not feel this book would have stood the test of time and become the classic that it is. Emma is a heart-warming book with enough orneriness mixed in to make it amusing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is light-hearted and fun to read if you have a decent attention span. Emma is proud of her recent match-making success and sets out to do more. After a few awkward setbacks, she learns not to play Cupid, and that love is random and spotaneous, and can't be forced. In some places, the book can be kind of slow, but if you keep going, it gets better. All in all, I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I also expected more, but i liked it a lot. And yes, it is for serious readers (you cant read Jane Austen if youre not one). Is funny and I liked Emma a lot. Although mr. Knightley was too old :p But is great. You must read it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I will admit that when it comes to reading things that are regarding as &quot;classics&quot; I usually want to kill myself. I find the language and story etc. boring. Emma, is actually the exception to that.Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband. Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege. Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable. Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco. The first man actually likes Emma. The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes. Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.It is an amusing read. The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes. She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot; or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read. you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily. It didn't. I had to work to read Emma.For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning. She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all. But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book. So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl. I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine. More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax. The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen. This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it. One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith. Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love. Austen usesirony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious. She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton. Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"\`Letme entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38). There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty. Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank. We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together. There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him. All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along. Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley. Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister. It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid. With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible for the reader to realize whatis actually going on. This adds to the surprise ending. How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever. Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance. Emma the character professes not to desire marriage. This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time. The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune. Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status. Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society. It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment. The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm. Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from. True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determined by the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth. The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch. The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch. In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit. Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction. From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink. Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\" Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities. You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far. EMMA is no different. An excellent read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a touching, comeing of age story. It is about a young girl who is close to becoming spoiled and conceited, but through many experiences both good and bad she slowly turns into a caring considerate woman. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and Emma is definately my favorite. It contains more humor than most of Jane Austen's stories and is fun to read. I would recomend this for a first time Austen reader, because it is such a fun book that is somewhat lighter and easier to read than some of Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is well-written for a love story. The outcome fits the story line perfectly. Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another. Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste of her own medicine. Her love set ups are not going as she had planned. Then everything hits her all at once. I love it! I would recommend this book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff. Jane Austen did it again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her. Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet. Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters. For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go. Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal. Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When I first picked up \\"Emma,\\" I was expecting it to be as charming and alluring as Austen's well-known \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". What I found, however, was it didn't quite measure up to my expectations. Although I had high hopes for this book, and anticipated it's spectacular outcome, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I found it hard to connect with Emma, the main character. At first, she seemed like a sweet young lady, caring for others and rarely found at fault. But once I learned of her snobby disposition, wealthy pride, and little care for the feelings of others, I wasn't as fond of her. Her character was set up as the stereotypical \\"snobby, rich girl\\" we think of today--one of whom makes sure to always get her way. The idea of the upper-class's success and how they are, evidently, the most intelligent of people, was the way Austen seemed to portray her character. Because of Emma's lifestyle and family setup, she was able to get most of what she wanted, most of the time. Although she wasn't always arrogant and rude, she certainly did have her flaws.Emma delighted in matchmaking, but, while doing so, didn't think of the feelings of others--which would later lead her into trouble. This \\"hobby\\" of hers often caused misunderstanding and, ultimately, ended in heartbreak. When Emma recognizes her \\"gifting\\" in this area, she uses it to her full potential. Even though she would try to turn things in the favor of those she was closest to, she often ended up in control of their lives. She went along assuming the emotions of others, when in reality, their feelings were not at all what they had seemed. Emma's assumptions led her nowhere. But, through all the distress she caused, she discovered a great deal about herself and her unrecognized love.When Emma's only mother figure in her life--Miss Taylor, the family governess--gets married and moves away, Emma becomes distraught. However, this discomfort soon gets pushed aside when Harriet comes into her life. Harriet is an orphan who becomes a friend to Emma. But, this relationship doesn't do good for either of them. Emma takes advantage of Harriet as her \\"pet\\", pulling her around and using flattery to make her do things. She puts things into Harriet's mind that aren't always true, trying to give her a hope of love.Throughout the many complicated relationships of Emma and her friends, there is one particular friend who stood beside her the entire time. He was Mr. Knightley--an old friend who steps in whenever he thinks Emma is taking things a little too far. She rarely listens to him, though, and must suffer the consequences. Even as smart as Emma was, she didn't have the intelligence to understand the feelings of others. She hardly put anyone before herself."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Thank you for the quick shipment!

Book was in condition stated, which is great!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"One of the better audiobook readings of any Austen novel. Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for? Grade: A"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I think Emma is a sparkling, witty and engaging story that beats a lot of modern works hands down. I found it hard to choose a favourite Austen but I think this one is just brilliant and Mr Knightley is definately my favourite of her heroes.

Not only does it have excellent plot, amusing dialogue, and a happy ending but it also lends a great amount of insight into this time in history. I am 18 years old and have read this book several times, surprisingly enough before any films were released, and can honestly say that it was my favorite novel ever written. Obviously those who only gave it one or two stars are more at home reading such low class literary works as Stephen King novels, which certainly have more excitement but don't actually require any real thought. I don't believe that the responses of such people to real literary works would really have any true value in my opinion since they quite apparently have no real intelligence or taste in literture whatsoever. My advice to such people would be to avoid real books and to stick to what they are actually capable of understanding."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate. Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys. This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful. In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry. But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character. It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is. And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself. Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This difference is more a matter of degree than in kind. In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic. The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book. The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play. Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself. The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not. Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting.

I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature. How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong? We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature. She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good. Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations. And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both. Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short. And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising. And we like her none the less for it. Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms. It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways. Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two. Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating. Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much. Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I must admit, I had really high hopes for this novel. However, after reading the first chapter, I put it down to go onto a different novel. A few months and a few novels passed and I again picked it up to try again. History does, indeed, repeat itself. Another chapter down, I went to another novel.Finally, after owning the book for 8 months, I decided it was time to just do it. So, I refused to allow myself to put it down again for another novel. It took me about twelve chapters to become involved in any character besides Mr. Knightly and to enjoy the story... but it did come.Had I reviewed this book before chapter 12, I would have said, &quot;No way... this book is too slow and long winded!&quot; However, after finishing it, I appreciate the author and the story more than I did before.I will say this much, however: I have discovered that I am a reader of Charlotte Bronte, but a viewer of Jane Austin movies adapted to film."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While doing research for a high school paper on Pride and Prejudice, I often came across the statement that Emma was Austen's masterpiece. Having practically memorized P&P; and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text. Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words. Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement. The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author. Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul. The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P;, or even S&S;, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse. If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation. She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak. While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness. Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit. The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her. Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity). Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional. Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty. Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted, young. Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do. They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre. Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity. It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so. As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch. What is amazing is how logically it all flows together. Genius.Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman. While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking. Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley. He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical. His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural. After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.; All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language. It's really quite impossible to compare P&P; and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot. This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I think most people are already familiar with the story of Emma, and many are probably also familiar with the back-story, which is that Jane Austen decided to write about a character which she thought \\"nobody but myself will much like.\\" I dare say there are plenty of people who indeed do not like Emma Woodhouse, but I have loved plenty of books, TV shows, and movies centered on a character I disliked (or even hated) far more than Emma, whose faults do not, at least, include witlessness, stupidity, or true ugliness of character.Added to Emma's attractiveness as a protagonist and other well-rounded characters that we may love or hate, is Jane Austen's excellent prose and story plotting, and, most importantly, her cutting humor and social commentary. Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park)."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works.

This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma has been well known since it's publishment. In the 90's, a successful chick-flick movie, Clueless was based on this novel. Even though the movie does not in any way depict the intelligence of Jane Austen, it serves the main characters' personalities. The book by far was absolutely and brilliantly written while easy to understand in fairly relatable modern English. This book is a great read for literature analysts because it serves a wide variety of character traits within their society. It can also be used to analyze the socio-economic stereotypes and lifestyles of their time. The plot and storyline were at a consistent pace with a surprising climax and turn towards the end. Because it is a love story, it does follow the usual typical love story scenes. However, love is depicted differently by each couple and character, which sets it apart from other cinderella-like stories, which were popular during that time period. It is a very relaxing book -- not an intense read. It is also a classic even though not as widespread or as known as other Austen's novels such as Pride and Prejudice. It is definitely a recommanded read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels. That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites. That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse. Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said. At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma. She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing. And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith. While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match. Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her. She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter. Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending. Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless. I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father. Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton.

Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a young woman from a little town not far from London, but isolated and unfrequently visited. Her mother has died and she lives with her father and her governess. Her family is at the very top of social standings in town, and Emma is all too aware of it. The starting point is her governess's engagement to a good man, which Emma imagines she has engineered by herself. Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While this novel is certainly a cut above most modern fiction, Emma is not Austen's best work. In contrast with Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey's tight narrative structures, Emma is long and rambling. The narrative presents many insignificant details even as it leaves out more important scenes. For example, we are privy to several examples of Miss Bates' idle chatter, but Harriet's capture by the gypsies and Robert Martin's proposal happen offstage. Although Miss Bates is supposed to be a lovable character, I found myself putting the book down during one of her conversations and not returning to it for several months (which is unusual, as I read Northanger Abbey in a day).Nevertheless, the novel does have its redeeming features. Several people have noted that they disliked Emma's snobbishness, but we're not meant to adore her, and the author gently pokes fun at her elitism. Prior to the book's publication, Austen wrote that she feared no one else would love Emma as much as she did, so the protagonist is not intended to be a likeable character. Her flaws balance out her good traits, such as her wit and liveliness. Her dialogues with Mr. Knightley and even Harriet contain subtle zingers that may not be readily apparent to a 20th century reader the first time around. If you think you didn't like this book, you will appreciate it more on a second reading (and you can always skim the boring parts, like poor Miss Bates!). You will learn a great deal about the classist ideology lurking beneath Regency Britain's prim veneer. And if nothing else, reading with the intent to pick up on the characters' oblique but witty repartee will help you sharpen your own wit and social skills."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is perhaps one of Miss Austen's most controversial heroines. From the age of match-makers and suppressed feminism, comes a book which makes you angry, ashamed and overpowered along with Emma herself.

Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Lovable Emma Woodhouse, Pretty, bright, and rich, not to mention a little mischievious.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma prides herself on her matchmaking ability. The happiness of the marriage of her former governess is her obvious proof. When she takes on Harriet Smith as her charge and determines to find the perfect match for her, her attempts fail time and time again. Disappointed in the outcome of her attempts, she resolves to only contribute to Harriet's happiness as her friend. In the end, when it seems that a match for Harriet may finally be made between Harriet and Mr. Knightley, only then does Emma realize the truth she has denied for so long and the folly of what she worked so hard for may cost her heart.Emma is a classic by Jane Austen and this is my first time reading one of Austen's works. I certainly understand why the book is considered a classic. Austen engages the reader who wonders about the outcome until the very end. The style in which it is written requires thought and time to truly understand the story. It is definitely not one that can be read through at a high speed and still comprehended at a high level. Personally, I loved this book. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not enjoy reading, but I would recommend it to people who are fans of romance."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I was very impressed by the response time and professionalism of the seller.

Emma Woodhouse is used to her position of consequence as mistress of her widowed father's house, and proud lady of an old, respected family. She over-estimates her own power and importance, running into trouble when she tries to govern the affairs of her neighbors. Mr. Knightly, brother of her sister's husband, scolds and chides while her senile daddy worries more about her staying up too late, or dancing in a crowded room. Mr. Knightly is always right, as, over and over, the strong-willed Emma is forced to admit; but the reformation of her ideas may be too late in coming. He goes away to London just when she realizes she cannot be happy without first place in his heart. A must read for all fans of classic literature."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"By E.G. (AP)\\"Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken...\\" This was a hard lesson for twenty-one year old Emma Woodhouse to come by. Emma takes on the role of a matchmaker, believing it is in her power to arrange marriages. Predictably, Emma eventually fails at her task. Failure causes Emma to lose innocence and become less ignorant to what in fact she can control.Emma is of a rich family; she's good looking, and she's clever. Emma is held in awe by most, especially her father who believes she is flawless. With such qualities and ideals at her disposal, Emma has very little to distress or vex her. The same circumstances convince her that she will never marry and promote naivete making reality a hard concept for Emma to grasp.Emma lacks knowledge of societal expectations especially where marriage is concerned. Taking place during the Victorian time period, one was expected to marry inside his class. Emma doesn't grasp this ideal which leads to failure and disappointment in her pursuit of making matches.Emma tries to acquaint Mr. Knightley with Harriet and to a certain extent, Jane. Emma discovers that she's once again led herself and Harriet astray. This instance in the book along with the knowledge that Mr. Knightley is one of few that can see faults in Emma, foreshadows an eventual change in plot. This is also the point in the story that a change in Emma's character becomes evident.When reading Emma, allow yourself plenty of time. There are many intricate details Involving who's interested in who that are interwoven into the plot and would be easy to pass by if not reading leisurely. It may be helpful to read a passage twice if you find yourself questioning what just took place. In order to fully enjoy the story; don't hurry through the book.A few of the characters have similar names. Sometimes the only thing separating one person from another is a subtle Miss or Ms. This can be frustrating if you don't fully grasp whom the book is speaking of. Again, read slowly and reread a passage if there's confusion about who the talked of subject is.Some characters are void of the story for an extensive amount of the book. This is also frustrating, as it may be hard to recall what role the character plays. It's beneficial to jot down character names and a few descriptors about them so when they reappear, their role can be recalled. Or, you may want to take time to flip back in the book and reread the scene in which they first appeared.Jane Austen did an exceptional job of writing satirically in order to portray silly ideals that Emma and society held. The standards for which marriages were arranged by become superficial and absurd through Austen's diction. Because it is apparent to the reader that Emma is chasing a dead end with her beliefs of who has taken interest in who, it's humorous when Emma comes to this realization herself. Austen chose exaggerated adjectives of perfection to describe Emma this creates a snicker because obviously Emma is not perfect but rather nave.Emma recalls memories of high school dance date set-ups that went wrong. It's comical to think back on either playing the role of matchmaker or having been the victim of a matchmaker when the quest for a date to the homecoming dance or prom is thrown into full effect. Most times the involvement of a third party misconstrues things much like Emma did. Feelings can be hurt similar to those of the characters in Emma making the matchmaker feel foolish but hopefully providing a lesson to all involved."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a great story, the heroine, depicted to be a selfish woman, who has been raised to believe she has no flaws, shows us through the book, how she learns tobe a woman that many people would dream to be. She shows true nature, adn acts as any human would. Her ongoing task to matchmake all her friends end in disaster, but in the end all is well. She handles her problems as one should, adn learns not to think so highly of herself. People say that it is too &quot;worldy&quot; but the book is one of the classics, Jane Austen outdid herself, this is my favourite Jane Austen book, it shows us that we all have flaws,a d that no one is ever perfect."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I really thought this book was wonderful! It was the first Jane Austen book I've read and I loved it! It was easy for me to keep the characters staight because I saw the movie first but totally enjoyed it the book too. Most people who gave this book a bad review called it, &quot;boring&quot;. One thing you should know: Jane Austen is not a writer of action novels. She likes to spread the story out. For anyone who have read her other novels, you know what I mean. If you found this boring, you should wait until your a little older to read this one. Although I like P&amp;P better, this was definatly not a bad book if your in the right mode to read it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love this book because it's timeless. True, it's set in the 1800's, but this book could have been written today. I know it's hard to sympathize with Emma, but deep down she just wants to see everyone happy. I love the part where she finds her own match right under her nose. I recommend this book to everyone who likes historical romances."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm just wondering what kind of a world those clueless people live in, to think Jane Austen is robbing some 90s movie of its story?"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"On a personal note I loved the book as I do all other Jane Austen classics, but I'm not going to trash anyone else's opinion. No one book can ever be loved by everyone. For other readers that enjoyed this as much as I did don't get upset when others don't like it, they just don't WANT to have to translate the different dialect from a different country over a century ago. It's not that they can't, but the more modern setting suits them better. It is true you do have to be a serious reader to get through this novel. If you loose hope in the first few chapters you're not giving it enough time, at this point you've just been introduced to the characters, dialect, and culture of these people. The first 4 or 5 chapters are the hardest, but that's because you're having to learn so much with out any aids to guide you. For everyone who did not enjoy this no one should scoff at your taste, but in the future don't trash mine either. We have different taste neither is betteror worse, just different. For anyone interested, yes, their is a plot but you have to understand Jane Austen's style to see it. If you like a challenge and you like to have your heart pounding in tune with the characters this is a book for you. Bye the way, I am now 16 but I read three of Jane Austen's novels as a freshmen in high school. It's not impossible but it's not easy either.I also recomend &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot; also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As one of the few teenagers who will read Emma voluntarily, I'd just like to say that, thought the length is daunting, I loved reading it all the way through. I first found out about it through the movie and was hooked! I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a good plot with a good, happy ending."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Many writers and critics consider Emma, the last of Austen's novels published in her lifetime, the climax of her genius. Dominating the novel is the character of Emma Woodhouse--vital, Interesting, complex, and predisposed to playing power games with other people's emotions. Austen called her a heroine &quot;no one but myself would like,&quot; but she endures as one of Austen's immortal creations. Charting how Emma's disastrous foray as a matchmaker precipitates a crisis in the small provincial world of Highbury, and in her own heart, this novel of self-deceit and self-discovery sparkles with intelligence, wit, and irony. In fact, as critics say,Emma is indeed a fine piece of work which was was written, surprisingly, by someone who lived a rather secluded life. It has all the Austen trademarks, as the constant concern over marriage and social status, which was a poignant and true characteristic of her time."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen was a truly gifted author whose simple stories, memorable characters, and insights into human nature make her writings as relevant today as they were in the early 1800's.Emma is the story of an attractive and fortunate young woman who has never had anything really bad happen in her life, and who believes herself to be much more wise and worldly than she actually is. For one who has led such a sheltered existence, never leaving home or intending to marry, Emma believes herself possessed of incredible powers of perception and feels that she knows what is best for those she loves far better than they could possibly know for themselves. It is this belief of hers that causes her to meddle in the affairs of those close to her, creating chaos, confusion, and misunderstandings everywhere. Her well-intentioned interference produes comical results and eventually teaches her a valuable lession about minding one's own beeswax.I was sorry to see this book end"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have read few books written with such a brilliant pen. There is more than a touch of sarcasm when Austen writes of society, but this is perhaps what keeps this book so alive. It is surprising how little society has really changed since the Victorian era. Emma comes across as a spoilt child, but lovable, as there is a shade of Emma in all of us. We all share the need to be involved in everything, and meddle with everyone's affairs, and there is a tale of unrequited love in all of our histories, even for a short time. I have not yet seen the film, as I am not sure of whether or not this would spoil it, as though there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Hollywood, Jane Austen should be present to direct it"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I confess: I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline. However, caution should be exercised in reading her books. Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events. In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike. It is a great tour de force. Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime? Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As with all of Austen's novels, the reader will find the breadth of human character within the cover. The novel demonstrates a biting wit as well as a sentimenal side. I first read this book when I was fifteen and I was absolutely captivated. If you have not read this book then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.I just finished Emma. I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times. I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.I needn't have worried. Books are never the same as movies. I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less. While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I absolutely loved this novel!! I'm also glad that before reading this novel I read Jane Austen's other famous works because I had practice with Austen's confusing vocabulary. Once I got used to it I was able to appreciate what was truly happening with Emma. I highly recommend this book to young girls that have a pedestrian outlook on love, because after reading this novel I learned that love isn't always about emotions but you have got to be sensible as well. Emma is a woman to be emulated, not because of her match-making attitude but of her convictions and strenght. She does not need a man to complete herself, but after finally allowing her eyes to open she does find bliss with the man she loves. I can go on and on about this novel, but then what would be the use of reading?? Get yourself a copy now! You won't regret it.."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep, now years later I decided to give it another shot. To my suprise, Emma was a delightful book. At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists. Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author! I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily, but it is perfect for teenagers and up, esspecially girls. :)"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Having been a devoted fan since early childhood, I have read all of Miss Austen's books at least twice, and I find this the most endearing. 'Emma' is a dazzling combination of wit, not-too-dreadful mishaps, mild drama, and affectionate, though insightful, looks at society.Emma, though a little petted and given to overconfidence in her intellect (brilliant people often struggle so), is definitely endearing (even more so than Gwyneth Paltrow). And, of course, Miss Austen's inventive method of relating dialogue is delightful. Of Mr. Woodhouse, the definitive hypochondriac: &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive...He did not know what they had best do...&quot; Jane Austen has a splendid way of drawing the characters through such dialogue - it is almost as if they come alive.If you ever read one book of Miss Austen's, read 'Emma'!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I listened to this as an audio book which is a somewhat different experience than reading it. I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles. I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal. It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place. However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable. She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position. This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt! She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others. When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person. Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma was such a character who in my opinion, was a little bit too conceited - she had thought to know of the feelings of other people that made her feel very confident of her match-making skills; and yet, when these matches failed to be, she thought the failures were all her doing too! Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited \`hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well. During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions. She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her. However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person. She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination. I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures. Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates. But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.However, over all, I enjoyed this book. I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then. At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma\\" isn't the most sophisticated or complex of Jane Austen's book but is my favorite by far. The characters, especially Emma, are funny and moving. I'm such a romantic and this is just delightfully fulfilling."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"EMMA\\" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) \\"PERSUASION\\" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is \\"free\\" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be \\"well read\\"!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I purchased this copy of Emma and it was the first time I read it. The second Jane Austen I've read. I must say that I enjoyed Emma much more than Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the humor in Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When Jane Austen sat down to write Emma, she had a tall order. Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Easy to get on my Kindle and to transport it everywhere.

However, I love reading about that English era so I stuck with it and enjoyed. Austen certainly has insight into human nature and as you read, you will recognize the traits and apply them to people you know."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I found Emma to be a pretty good book. However, for me it seemed to take to long for them to actually say anything & get to the point."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This is my second attempt at reading Emma. When I got it in late August, I got about twenty pages and had to put it down. Now, I picked up where I left off, and I really enjoyed this one. I don't know why I couldn't get through it before. Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice. Penguin uses 3D imaging to scan a woven pattern. So basically, you can feel the stitches on the front of the cover and the back of the cover (and the back side too.) Beautiful, beautiful design, and I look forward to reading some of the other books from this series.Emma was an enjoyable read; though I didn't love it as much as Pride and Prejudice, I definitely liked it more than Northanger Abbey.4.5 stars.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen is a master storyteller. After seeing the movie with Gwenth Paltror many times, I loved reading the entire story."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm sorry, I know that Emma is supposed to be Austen's comic masterpiece and it is wonderful, but it's probably my least favorite Austen novel. That said, I still like it a great deal.Emma is funny. If you liked Pride and Prejudice, then you'll love Emma.However, I like Austen's darker, heavier books, like Persuasion and Mansfield Park.Emma is long, far longer than S&S; or Persuasion, but it's also fluffier. Emma is rich, very quite rich, so she doesn't have the problems of the Bennett girls in P&P; or the girls in S&S;, or even the gentler money problems of the ladies in Persuasion.Emma is Jane's fantasy, what she might have done if she were rich.If you like Jane Austen, you'll like Emma.If you like Jane Austen's sharp, stinging wit, try one of her others.V."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I think this is Jane Austen's best novel. Its main character is lovable but incredibly flawed. Her saving grace is that she is prepared to acknowledge her repeated errors. The other characters are also both interesting and believable, though the hero Mr Knightley is a bit too good to be true - but then most of Austen's heroes are a bit bloodless except for Darcy and perhaps Willoughby. Emma, the novel, is also a mystery. Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel. The backdrop of privilege and patronage with its ever present snobbery and prejudice are gently but critically presented. Austen's most satirical, most humourous work"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I first read this in college for my intro to British Lit course - it's been my favorite Austen novel ever since."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A classic story. Kindle edition with a fair number of spelling errors, certainly keep the read interesting. Can't beat the price though."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love this Austen novel, it is wriggling its way into the number one spot. Emma is SO easy to relate to and yet her misinterpretations and \\"kind intentions\\" illustrate faux pas we all make! Each character one meets is so well-rounded one feels they could step out of the page into my everyday life! The story is enjoyable from start to finish, a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Who can deny the fact that almost every earthling has taken up the fancy of arranging others' lives as roles of puppets? &quot;Life is a stage&quot; so Shakespeare claims, Emma Woodhouse just finds herself enthralled to such dramatic performances, and being so confident of her &quot;directing&quot; skill, scene after scene of Highbury romantic comedies come alive under the hands of Emma before she is even aware of them herself.A charming sample of Austen's lighter works, Emma presents the story of a Victorian era Cher, busy meddling with the love-conquests of her young apprentice Harriet Smith, fumbling into a carelessly-knit net of pretence, then rising to find her Prince Charming in a quiet corner of her throbbing young heart."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The divison of opinion on this page is interesting but probably not surprising. Emma is a book for serious readers and if you go in expecting an easy-to-read page turner, then stick to Danielle Steele. (It is beyond depressing that two people who wrote reviews were somehow of the amazingly ignorant opinion that Jane Austen ripped off Alicia Silverstone's Clueless.....Rather difficult seeing as she was alive in the early 1800's .....hmmm.) Emma takes patience but it's a rewarding read, with all the complications, misunderstandings andbanality of your average soap opera yet shining with Austen's trademark subtle wit and mordant intelligence which has made this novel a classic.Books do require a little more time, effort and thinking than sitting mindlessly in front of Alicia Silverstone, but what you take away from the experience is a much wider understanding."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so. But stick with it. However, those looking for an introduction to Jane Austen might be better suited with faster paced Pride &amp; Prejudice and gradually make your way toward this one.Two things that I liked very much about this book. The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible.But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.A nice story, just not a great one. Outside of the reservations mentioned, I'm glad I read it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is one of her more unknown works, and yes, it does seem tedious to read. However, those readers out there who say that they are &#34;very disappointed by emma&#34; are not thinking the right way.If everybody in the world were disappointed by books that are &#34;boring&#34; or &#34;tedious&#34; to read, nobody would ever have read Moby Dick or Les Miserables. (Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason. What is the point of using literary examples in an essay if the literature doesn't depict realistic characters?Yes, Emma can be a snob, ignorant, and a little vain, but appreciate her for the human being she is and enjoy the classic Jane Austen book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

Can't wait for penguin to release more in this series."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Be warned: this book is slow. very slow. i loved pride and prejudice, but i would have quit partway through this one if it hadn't been a gift.However, if you have the patience and fortitude to get through it, you will be rewarded. Though i could have done without so much detail about the planning of a party, or full chapters of Emma and Mr. Knightley talking things to death, it was an overall good book. Emma is very fully developed. She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom. Especially towards the end, I had a lot of fun picking out hints and speculating, and seeing my guesses come out right.The book isn't so amazing that i would urge everyone to struggle through the whole length of it, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. it just could have been much shortened."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This was the first time I had \\"read\\" Emma. What have I been missing? This is a beautiful book, and beautifully read in this CD version. I don't think literature gets any better than this. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her. Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Clueless, which was based on &quot;Emma&quot;. Clueless was made in the 1990's, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700's and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that &quot;Emma&quot; came first.

She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library. I would suggest \\"Emma\\" above any other Jane Austen's classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a \`new style of novel' designed to \`suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviiiIf I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch's essay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented. Good separation of characters. Her rendition of Miss Bates is incredible - leaves one breathless."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously. Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet. Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him. Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come. Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed. Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her. Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him. Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching. Emma is so busy arranging other people's lives that she neglects her own wants and needs. Emma is wealthy and a godd person, but she's not a saint and she doean't come off as one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am 11 and a 1/2 years old and simple love books that take place in Europe in the 1700 or 1800's. However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her &quot;friend&quot; Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this &quot;little gem&quot; for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I hate it. So boring. I fell asleep at the first page. its great if youre into that old 1800s kind of speech."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Four hundred pages of the idle rich filling up their vain and empty lives by meddling in other people's affairs while exchanging gossip and pointless drivel about their relative social standing, followed by one hundred pages of an embarrassingly bad romance novel, plus one very annoying character (Emma's father) who clearly has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome. I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo, action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood. If only the book had been that tolerable.All right, Austen fans, slam my review if you want, but all you readers-for-fun out there, those of you I might have saved from a long boring nothing-happens kinda novel: YOU'RE WELCOME!!!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book.

For the last month or so, I've been trying to read \\"Emma,\\" and I believe I lack only 50 pages. I'm determined to finish. Actually, I started reading it about a year ago. If I can suffer through 10 pages a day, I think I'm doing well. I plan some type of celebration once I'm done.One of my graduate students used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Jane Austen. I agree 100%. Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say. Maybe not. She simply goes on and on and on.Personally, it's novels like \\"Emma\\" (or any other novel by the outdated Ms. Austen) that turn kids against literature. When I was in the 10th grade, we had to read \\"Silas Marner,\\" a totally painful experience. I reread it years later, thinking maybe I had misjudged it as a teen. I had. It was even more painful.i'm really thinking about beginning a Website, \\"Real Men Don't Read Jane Austen.\\" But that's sexist, isn't it? I can only hear Ms. Austin responding, \\"Do you mean to say if real men don't read me, unreal men do? What's an unreal man? Are there both real men and unreal men in the world?

Try another Austen book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading this novel, I realized how entertaining/touching an old book could actually be. The story was about a woman (Emma) who despised marriage, and felt that there was no need to dedicate her life to only one person. I felt that Emma was a very strong character, she knew what she wanted and would not let anyone alter her decision about marriage. However, at the end of the novel the character succumbs to societal pressures and marries the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen. I feel that everyone should read this book, because even though it was written over a century ago, individuals now are able to read it and feel like they can relate to the characters, at least I felt that I could."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a wonderful story.

It's a classic worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is twenty years old, living in the countryside of Victorian England. Her father is a wealthy hypochondriac, constantly worried about his own health or the health of others. He dotes on Emma and can see no wrong in anything she does. Emma's mother died when she was a small child, and her older sister married and moved away some years ago. This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking.At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well. She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor. Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings.Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused. Will she be a successful matchmaker? Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married?I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow. I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book. Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature.This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen.Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Those who gave this book a three or lower must not know how to appreciate formal writing. I'M SORRY!

Go out and learn something for once. Some people can be so stubborn. Hey, go out and read Remains of the Day. That was about a butler. And it was great. Emma was a good book. It's a good story.

It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time.If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.

The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc. Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama.

Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\"."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings. Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

While driving, folding laundry, cooking or cleaning, I can absorb Emma once more!

For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto. Rather, it transcends the gender wars and remains a touching comedy of errors with a profoundly subtle commentary on human pride and folly."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In a letter to a relative Austen once wrote \\"3 or 4 families in a country village is the very thing to work on \\"She knew this world intimately and well and it was the subject of her best novels of which Emma most assuredly is one .Emma Woodhouse is young,lively and thoroughly spolied .She is complacently sure she knows what is best for all her friends and acquaintances ,especially in matters of the heart .She is a self-appoinited matchmaker to all her friends and she particularly interests herself in the affairs of the young and naive Harriet Smith,an unassertive and timid young woman .Emma is convinced Harriet would be ideally matched with the local minister Mr Elton not knowing that he despises Harriet for her lack of social graces and standing and that he is set on wooing and winning Emma herself .Emma is idly contemplating a dalliance with a newcomer to the village ,Frank Churchill ,but her real feelings are for the local squire George Knightley .Knightley is an amused and exasperated spectator to the meddling which is second nature to Emma.The novel deals with the way Emma's plans for others collapse and she as a consequence comes to a new and painful degree of self-awareness.She knows less about herself and others than she fondly imagines .The book is a very tough-minded piece of work and has universal themes to do with human motivations and self-deception.It shows the manipulations and strategems of the marriage market as supremely important in society .Emma is essentially about growing into self awareness rather than a romantic comedy as so many other Austen novels are .It is why it still retains its impact so many years after its original publication .The support cast is well drawn -Elton,in particular being a great sketch of an odious snake who has somehow been born as human being .Any society in which people meddle in each others affairs is one in which Emma is still a valid book"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"*Warning: there are some plot spoilers in this review!*Jane Austen has a reputation as a witty, humorous writer with a keen eye for human folly and failings, and with this novel she certainly lives up to her reputation. While Emma isn't as popular as my personal favorite Pride and Prejudice, I believe that Emma is so popular, and can be considered \\"literature\\" (that is, a piece of art) because the story really has a universal quality to it. The fact that we can relate to the situations and characters in Emma some 300 years later is what makes it seem so timeless, and why the Emma movie with a \\"modern twist\\", Clueless, was so wildly successful. When you compare both Emma and Clueless they show how little has changed and that privileged teenagers (and young adults) will find themselves in the same situations and social patterns, whether they are in 19th century England or 21st century America.Of course, while the wealthy and bored teenagers in Clueless might try to set up their friends on dates, the stakes were a bit higher in Emma. Emma (the heroine) attempts to match her new friend Harriet Smith with the new minister Mr. Elton not just for dating, but for marriage as long as they both shall live (remember, divorce was rare, if not nonexistent in early 19th century Britain.) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when Mr. Elton becomes interested in Emma, not Harriet. The problem was that Emma (already conceited because she successfully \\"guessed well\\" when she matched her tutor Ms. Taylor with a local widower Mr. Weston) failed to get to know Harriet and Mr. Elton well enough to figure out if they were, in fact, right for each other. Emma shows her class-snobbery when she (through some very adolescent mind games) convinces Harriet to reject the proposal that she receives from a local farmer (Mr. Martin, the man Harriet likes and eventually falls in love with), in the hopes that Mr. Elton will propose. Emma was too self-centered and (to steal the phrase from Amy Heckerling) clueless to notice that Mr. Elton was not, in fact, interested in Harriet, but in herself--a fact that leads to Harriet's heartbreak. Of course, this is only one part of the multi-faceted story that Jane Austen created about the life of a \\"handsome, clever and rich\\" woman living in Highbury, England, but it gives you a sense of the life and times of Ms. Emma Woodhouse (as we see them in the book)Fortunately, all is well in the end when Emma learns her lesson about matchmaking and toying with emotions and discovers that she loves her brother-in-law and well loved family friend Mr. Knightly. This is a classic \\"happy ending by way of falling in love with the best friend that you had all along,\\" but with a slightly dated feel. First, he is sixteen years older than her and he, in a way, helped to raise her (at least, in principles). The fact that he admits openly to having been \\"in love with (her) ever since (she) was thirteen at least,\\" slightly bothered me. Who, in the 21st century, would admit to having a crush on their 13 year old sister-in-law? In the context and time of the novel it's romantic. Now Mr. Knightly might be described as a pedophile. However, the dated dialogue (like the above) is the only qualm I had about the book, and I hope that it doesn't discourage anyone from reading Emma. Overall, I would recommend this book to any Clueless fan, romantic-comedy fan, or anyone who wants to read the wonderfully universal writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Very much like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Emma, a novel by Jane Austen, is a tale of confusion and intrigue over the universal topic of love. The reader's feelings of befuddlement and captivation, while nonexistent at the beginning of the novel, will grow exponentially until the climax. At the end of the novel, everything finally makes sense and the characters live on happily ever after. This is a very satisfying ending, clearing up all earlier confusion, although it leaves little room for wonder and thought after the reader has finished the book. Though I found this novel very confusing, and therefore unenjoyable at times, the intrigue and vivid setting and characterization overpowered my initial dislike. I would recommend Emma, to seventh through ninth grade students who are capable of deciphering meaning from complicated words and are able to pick out the essential subject matter of passages that do not state the meaning strait out. Readers will enjoy the frenzied, almost comical, characters in all their confusion over who loves whom, as well as all the wonderful descriptions, and the satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I just recieved my copy of this wonderful work by Jane Austin and, even though I have hardly had time to crack open the beautiful cover, I must say the edging on the pages is exactly as they say: It is uneven and roughly cut. Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N; doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.SPOILER WARNINGOne of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Emma is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Emma, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma (Barnes & Noble Classics)Great Book if you like the classics as I do. Quality of the pages is very good (acid free should you wish to keep it and, smooth texture)."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly \`helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together.Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that.This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Maybe it was the way Jane Austen drew the reader into the story, or possibly the twists and turns of the plot, but whatever it was to add the extra flavor it worked. The book demonstrates a perspective on love that can only be seen through the eyes of a person who involves themselves as a whole in the book. It has a way of making it an impossible task to put it down. This story stands the tests of time and will surely work it's way into the hearts of millions more.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I actually saw the film (with Paltrow as Emma) before reading the book and I must say, that I am glad that the movie was very true to the novel because I adore the movie. I was actually surprised that the book was so similar. It features one of my favorite Jane Austen characters, Emma of course. She is a joy to read about. The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times.

Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen is one of the greatest women writers in history, and Emma ranks among her best. The characters are rich and varied. For anyone with an interest in Victorian literature, Emma is sure to be a hit."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I tried to read this book when I was in middle school and quickly returned it to the shelf when I found it slow and boring. I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before. \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions. Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned. Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship.I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned. Maybe after I've read some more of her novels I won't value \\"Emma\\" as highly, but for now, this novel is high up on my list, and I enthusiastically reccomend it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women. All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world. This book is a bit boring and dry in the sense that everything is just always so beautifully fitting. Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities.At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it. The book is well written and clearly at a 187 years old, has stood the test of time. Nonetheless, at this stage in my life I was not motivated to finish the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Received my book 2-3 days after I purchased it! It is in even better shape that I thought it would be in, love it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Yet another solid Jane Austen classic. Had all the trademarks of typical Austen...a strong heroine, interesting characters, plenty of humor, and misunderstandings that eventually become cleared up for a most delicious ending!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This product reads well on my little Android, a great way to keep track of your reading! I enjoyed the book, Emma, it takes me into an older, different era where gentility still existed. Refinement used to be an art."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I don't know what it is about Jane Austen's novels, but I've read two of them now and I find that I really do enjoy them. The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!! A wonderful story which held my attention from beginning to end. I read it on my kindle and could not put it down. The recent movie follows it very faithfully."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???) but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance, but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her. I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself. I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book. I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read. The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is. She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us. She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters. Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular. I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It was hard to like the main character but it is supposed to be. I liked her father enough to make up for it. Good book very well written but I think it will not last in my mind like P&P."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she really loved it. The binding and printing is really beautiful and they look great on a shelf. Probably ok to read as well."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I thought Emma was a deligtful book with a great ending i knew it would end that way but it was fun to read and jane austen is now my hero."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'. This book (Emma) is deffinantly one of my favorite. Still, I think if you are considering reading your first Jane Austen I reccomend Pride and Prejudice, it's a little more acssesable. after you have finished Emma watch version with Gwenath Pultrow film of it it is much better than the BBC version. still read this book! Even if you read slowly your time will never regret it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I would classify this book as my favorite out of all the Jane Austen novels. It makes me cry everytime I finish it, because of The beautiful artwork of Austen's writing. Making all of Emma's mistakes seem so real, and her triphums seems as though they are your's. I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters. Thought it always finishes with a happy ending, it gives hope that even as clueless (not meant to be a pun) as Emma is and how many stupid mistakes she made her efforts are rewarded with all of her matchmaking adventures coming to an end and everyone who was caught in the confusing love web being freed."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Marvelous! Incredible! Amazing! Wonderful! That about sums it up right there. It was a great book. I t kept you in on going suspense on who was going to marry who. It tied up all the ends and it made you want to leap for joy at how happy things turned out. I definitely would give this book to you if you asked me &quot;What is the best book on earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is basically a darling snob. She has a kind, loving heart, and really wants to do good, but makes a tangle of everybody's lives, including her own. I'm sick of flawless, shallow, empty heroines, so Emma's faults and conquering of faults endear her. The unabridged book is slightly complicated (such as old-fashioned language) but if you savor it slowly it is well worth it. The plot is clever, sweet, funny and leaves a satisfied, warm kind of glow in the pit of your stomach. The perfect ending makes you want to cry. Don't spoil THIS novel with any trashy sequels.TRY WATCHING the Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam &quot;Emma.&quot;"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have always loved this droll piece of literature! Jane Austen created a charming and hilarious heroine in Emma. The comic timing and great characterization proves that Austen was -- and still is -- the most sought-after and influential author ever! (Just look at the work of Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes and other female authors of this era.)Emma is a force to be reckoned with. She takes it upon herself to play the role of Cupid. She chooses her candidates according to social status, age, charm, etc. The irony, of course, is that Emma doesn't have a lover of her own. What happens when one of her conquests as Cupid goes terribly wrong? And will Emma find her own knight of shining armor? This is one of the funniest situations in the book.If you love Jane Austen, and if you haven't read this novel, please do!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma. Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands. Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances. As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved. Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with. For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home. In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk. Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages. Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today. It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction. Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"How could Jane Austen have thought that the character of Emma would please no one but the author?I was charmed to enter Emma's world, amused by her wit, stunned by her complacency, sympathetic when she made her mistakes. I finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.I had seen the movie version starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.There has been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today. After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated, immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that exist among all people, no matter the time or place."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; is definitely Jane Austen's best and most humorous book. The quirky characters, comic faux pas, and Emma's adventures in matchmaking keep you very entertained. Although it's funny, the vocabulary can be challenging. (Austen had an astounding vocabulary for never even having gone to a secondary school!) If you need a classic and want some laughs along the way, &quot;Emma&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Good book, not just a romance novel.

Her mother died when shewas little, and Emma's governess, Miss Taylor, married Mr. Weston. Emma is now all \\"alone\\" with herfather at Hartfield. She decides to excite her boring life by trying to find Harriet Smith a husband. Emmadecided never to marry, but she breaks that decision later on in the book. She tries to make Harriet theperfect gentlewoman, who has a good taste in men. Harriet and Robert Martin, a young farmer wholikes her, are \\"in love\\" already when Emma decides to find Harriet a husband, and she convinces Harrietto dump Robert. One problem is that Mr. Elton, who Emma tries to set Harriet up with, is in love withEmma, or at least her money.

Then Mr. Knightley comes intothe romantic picture, both Emma and Harriet fall in love with him. After all the attempts, both girls getmarried, but I'm not going to tell you who marries who.Emma is a comedy of manners.

One \\"struggles\\" to decipher who, where, and when. This is much more than a comedy of manners. Holmes would have been baffled by the twists and turns, the hints and allusions; and that is what made it so difficult to put this novel down. A \\"whodunit\\", if ever there was one.

I have never read Jane Austen before so having it for free is just so convenient! I highly recommend this book. The quality in my kindle is also really good."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Among fans of Jane Austen in the U.S., most may not recognize Juliet Stevenson by name; however, they will certainly recognize her from her photograph as \\"Mrs. Elton\\" in the film adaptation of Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and therefore might be inclined to dismiss a reading of Emma by the deplorable Mrs. Elton. Big mistake. Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse. As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters. She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_. Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. We who love reading these treasures by Jane Austen are, therefore, in very good hands when listening to these unabridged audio versions."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Yet another charming & beautifully published book.

Why Alecia Sivlerstonedoesn't sue Jane Austin is beyond me!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than &quot;Emma&quot;, and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, &quot;Emma&quot; is a waste."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Having been forced to read &quot;Emma&quot; for an English Literature course, I feel that I know as much about it as anyone else, if not more so. &quot;Emma&quot; is nothing more than a trashy romance, like the rest of Jane Austen's novels. We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what? Anyone who describes an Austen novel as a &quot;classic&quot;, particualy this one, needs their head examined. She is an olden days Jackie Collins, whose fancy language seems to have deluded some into believing that she is something which she certianly is not."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Lively, vivid rendition of my favourite Jane Austen novel. Prunella Scales interprets the characters with great individuality and spirit."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"EMMA is a joyful read, made even more entertaining through Prunella Scales's vocalization of several characters and through her interpretation of the text. Her complementary pace actually improves the listeners' appreciation of Austen's comedic plot. Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time. Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance. Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation. In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values. Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code.The very fact that Emma is looking for \`would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly. Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride. Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy. Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped.Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception. While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a \`know-all' attitude. She is utterly self-important and presuming. She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill. She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse. Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference. Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self.Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships. Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage.Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\". But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies. Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma. And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to \`socially inferior' people. Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery. She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation. She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth. In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way.Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans. We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are. For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations. The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system. The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator.Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values. These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption. It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being. Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reasonRonald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on the social conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change - love, pride, marriage, status and money.Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool. the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now. Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions. though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book. i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then. it's amusing, witty, and shocking. really great book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm in the fellowship of the \\"unashamed.\\" That is, I'm a whole-hearted MALE fan of all things Austen. It all began when I found my daughter's dusty college copy of Emma from our library because I was bored and could not find anything else to read. After struggling through the first 100 pages and trying to make sense of Miss Austen's enormous character list, I was hooked. What hooked me? First and formost was the very intertwined plot, much like a romantic \\"whodunit\\" or \\"who's gonna do it\\" mystery. The plot thickens with subtle clues as to who loves whom and the comedy surrounding the heroine's naive' and fumbling attempts to become a matchmaker to anyone in her circle that is marriage material. Never in my life have I read such succulent and appropriate dialogue. I was so enthralled I literally roared through the book to find out what was going to happen next. A second reading is mandatory for the first-timer because part of Miss Austen's genius is that a more deliberate reading mines the depths for the clues that lie beneath the surface of the story. Like the tip of an iceberg, the reader can storm through the book and enjoy it thoroughly; then do a re-read and luxuriate on how much richness and delicate detail lie below the surface. I was so caught up that I found myself talking to the characters alternately encouraging them and warning them on what they were scheming. The heroine Emma is one of the most charming, yet frustrating heroines in all of English literature. Give it a \\"go\\" as the English would say!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I found this book extremely interesting, and it held a very unique story line, which seems at times hard to come by in many recently published books. I enjoyed the main character, Emma, whose character was so incredibly... fun, (mainly) mature, rommantic, and exciting all in one. Her want to match everyone with a lover reminds me very much of the premise of the novel A Midsummer Nights Dream. Though some parts extend and go into more detail than it seems necessary, the book is overall worth reading!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is a witty young lady of Hartfield, in England during the nineteenth century. She learns of life and love during the whirlwind fo events that change her life forever. Jane Austen has really outdone herself this time. The book desplays a charming sense of humor and knowledge from the author's point of view and the way each character is portrayed gives a beautiful visual effect in the mind. If this book proves its worth I would certainly say that any of the other novels written by Jane Austen are as wonderful as this book was for me."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"No one reads a book like Fiona Shaw. No matter what she narrates, her voice weaves a golden web, entrapping the listener with great charm and ease.Shaw's narration of Emma is no exception. Jane Austen's ambitious matchmaker and her circle of friends come vibrantly to life as Shaw's beautifully modulated voice gives each character his or her own pitch and tone. You hear Mr. Knightly chide Emma for her recklessness and &quot;poor Miss Taylor&quot; speculate that Miss Fairfax and Mr. Knightly are &quot;a couple.&quot; Their voices come alive entrancingly.Austen's story is wonderful to read, but Fiona Shaw makes it an even greater treat to listen to. I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV. Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\" In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly. Pop this one into your CD player or iPod during your commute to work. I highly recommend it. \\"It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do.\\" Ch 21Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"And I mean that in a good way.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Of all of Jane Austen's books, this one certainly gets my vote for the best. I loved it because I could relate to the character of Emma. No, she isnt perfect, but her flaws are part of what makes her so real. While the Bennett women were certainly by no means perfect either (the crazy mother immediately took away any hopes of that), they always seemed rather flat to me. Emma is witty and charming, but with a degree of authenticity that makes her seem less like a character in a novel, and more like your best friend. highly recommend."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's, Emma, is about an upper-class young woman from the 18th century. She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making. By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions. Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided. The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly. They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses.Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her. Comical witticisms pervade the novel. The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction. The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character. Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches. In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma. I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. Both of these paled in comparison to Emma. I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief. She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her. She was great because of her fallibility. Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions.The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets. It is more subtle and underplayed. It is above all a story about society. I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period. Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid. Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony. This explained the emphasis on connections.The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly. He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma. It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating. Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong. I wanted her to be right for once and laugh at him for being precocious. This, of course, never happened. Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire. If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love. At any rate.&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so. In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable. She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all. Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor. Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma. Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur. Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes. That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept. The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury. Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel! One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether. Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable. This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The problem is that Jane Austen is so popular - her books are the only 200 year old novels to stay in the Amazon top 5000- that people come to her expecting easy reading. This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them. When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;. Jane Fairfax's father is killed in action (presumably against Napoleon - or maybe the Americans) Harriet Smith is the daughter of a tradesman decent enough to support her but not married to her mother.

I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&quot;&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!&quot; -Jane Austen, EmmaThe edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted by Josef Stieler. So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ? Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted courtships, so popular among all readers ? We well understand why she should have been a favorite of Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ? These questions are directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have political ramifications ? The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my favorite of her novels.At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless, which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever written. Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike. The plot of the tale is presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite eschewing the idea of marriage for herself. In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband. There follow the expected misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom (read Orrin's review). Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's decision-making. Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy requires to function smoothly. Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting with their best interests at heart. There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators intended.The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists. They decry the system of oppression which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance. In reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal. In its own way Emma is as stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon. That her books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is memorable as the embodiement of reason.

Emma is very much like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility in style. The characters are beautifully developed as with Austen's other novels. There may be a bit too much emphasis on understanding one's place in society. Emma's pickings become very slim making her eventual engagement predictable, and her attempt to play matchmaker and improve a friend's standing is met with disastrous results. Bottom line - if you like Jane Austen, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love Jane Austen and Emma is one of her better works. It was beautifully written and the characters jumped off the page.

I have found that as an adult, wow, people used a LOT of words to say something simple back then.The story is the classic tale that I have long loved, but reading it is a bit tedious."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This is a novel written a long time ago. A lot of the terms and expressions need explanations for the modern reader. This edition of the masterwork by Austen does not have footnotes at the end, nor does it have an up-to-date scholarly introduction by some University professor."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I needed this book for a college class and it held up just fine. For the price, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover. In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate. Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma. She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong. And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father. To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking. She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage. Irony abounds.This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials. The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny. The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples. The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private. The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel. The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced. The plotting is intricate. Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book. The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud. This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book. The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye. Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me. Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written. In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together. Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love the movie with Gweneth Paltrow and Jeremy North and so i read the book. It was wonderful. a great classic, a great look back in time. The characters are rich and the prose keeps you reading. Best of all, it was FREE."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"To put it simply, this is a story about love in various forms and degrees. The most important thing about love and relationships, however, is that no one can control who a person does and does not love. It's entertaining to follow Emma Woodhouse as she tries to play matchmaker, thinking that she knows best, and in the end she even surprises herself. You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth)."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Handsome, clever and rich\\" is how Emma is introduced to us, and a happy, carefree existence she leads, with very little to worry her other than idle gossip. The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while, she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Written in a very different dialogue, sometimes hard to understand what she means the way she express's her thoughts and feelings. I would call it very old English setting"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I finally finished Emma after months (yes you heard me right) of reading. I lked this book but I didn't adore it.I think the characters were well done. My favorites were Mr. Woodhouse and his germaphobic ways...as well as his distaste in people getting married and leaving their cozy little lives. I also liked Harriet Smith because she had a simple and almost innocent way about her...the way she blindly followed Emma and molded the desires of her heart according to Emma's approval. I felt a connect to Harriet in that way...especially thinking back to high school...the popular girls trying to get you to think a certain way and telling you would make a good boyfriend.Emma Woodhouse is a likeable character. She is a matchmaker who gives up on the hobby due to her matches never fall for each other and drama is the result. The secound half of the book is about Emma finding out her own heart.The reason I only gave two stars was because to me this was an okay read. I saw some of the new movie and the theme interested me...so because it was free on my Kindle and because I wanted to try a sophisticated and chic lit type read...I read it.If you can keep up with drama and who likes who...and if you enjoy a well written novel with a long letter thrown in for the juicy details you crave...than leave the gossip behind and stick your nose into one of Austen's lesser known novels. As for me I prefer Dickens and anything with a bit more action."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I bought this book to be a decoration on my shelf. I loved the picture and the book looked just like it.

However, I reviewed this book as a 4 star simply because it lacks the strong story that other books from Ms. Austen display.Emma is a bit scheming and conniving and the story actually is more about events that just happen because of her medling ways. When I reviewed Pride and Prejudice I wrote how I loved the language - and this is no different. The word structure is exquisite. If it wasn't for the fact that I find Emma sometimes a bit too nosey I would love this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

As a teacher, I would love to offer a course in Jane Austen in general; in the current educational environment, I doubt that will happen. If I were allowed to do so, I would have students compare this novel with Pride and Prejudice simply because I think the papers would be interesting to read. The book is written in typical Austen style, the characters are endearing, and the situations are frequently funny - all in all a good read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, to me, has always been the &quot;truest&quot; of Austen's heroines. Emma's flaws are so real. I don't know any woman who is completely innocent of vanity, so it's refreshing to find a character, like Emma, who is drawn out for us in all of her &quot;princess syndrome&quot; glory. The &quot;good&quot; Austen characters, like Jane Bennett or Fanny Price, often leave me with a false feeling that I can't relate to. Emma Woodhouse's story intrigues and envelops me. I've read it over and over again...and the book never stays on my shelf for long."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Without a doubt, the most whitty and comical Austin novel.

I enjoyed Emma as Austen discusses the dangers of tampering with other people's lives, the characteristics a perfect gentleman should have, and what ignorance a spoiled class snob with managerial power could have.Emma is really a little different than Austen's other works. It doesn't have as much impact in story or romance. The story is going to feel dry to many people. It's a mystery novel with no mystery. But it's a good read for Austen fans and a great novel with many aspects to discuss."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a favorite in our house, and it's great to have the text in a free Kindle edition.

It just didn't captivate my interest. I did read it to the end only because I was curious about Emma and how it would end. I remember very little of it and it is a long novel. It took me 5 months to finish it. I usually finish a book in a few days once I get started. Also it was written in an Old English style and some of it I did not understand.I would only recommend it to someone who likes the Old English writing style."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and I'm tickled my oldest daughter also loves her novels.

I find her works very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Some might think I'd be ashamed, giving to this celebrated Jane Austen novel a mere 4 stars. But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out? Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma. Well developed characters and relationships between. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am currently reading this book and loving it. It fills in all the details that are missing in the movie. I love Jane Austen's style of writing and it amazes me how long ago she wrote this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Despite being believed to be a ladies' book, the story and language of Jane Austen are invaluable regarding language studies, classic British cultural and social research, and overall knowledge expansion.

The plot is ingenious, and the characters are hilarious. Dover does a good job of publishing, and this book is no exception. I highly recommend Emma!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Reading Emma was as much fun as watching the movie because it has details, events, and situations that the movie omitted. Another reason I enjoyed reading the novel is that I could take my time and savor the story. Getting through some of the language usage was a bit challenging, but, if you love reading Jane's other novels, this one is just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love the option of being able to read Emma online and take notes on my Kindle Fire. The story is a classic Comedy of Manners novel about courtship and marriage for the wealthy Victorians. The only drawback to the online version is the Chapters are numbered differently - the print version just consecutively numbers all of the chapters but the online version starts Part II with new numbers."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is probably me favorite book by Jane Austin. I do not want to give away anything, but you must get to know this wonderful girl."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've read all of Jane Austen's classics. Emma is my favorite one. I've read it twice. I really connected with each of the characters and the story unfolds in a compelling fashion. Austen's writing is impeccable and a effortless joy to read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I can't remember the last book I disliked as much as I dislike Emma. GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen has a lot of fans. I am one of them. My wife is another. People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not. This is as it should be. We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though. It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel. This is also only right.The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works. Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!Yes, we are a family torn asunder. My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here. I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order. I bought this one for her.For the asking price of this book, including S&H;, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it. It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present. I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent! Trust me...I know about such things. Hey folks, this is not advertized nor is it a leather bound first edition! This is a workable, useful book for everyday use.Now I have both this work and P&P; down loaded to my Kindle. The chances of my wife ever using one of these reading machines are as about as likely as pigs flying next mayday. It ain't going to happen. Therefore, she now has a new hardback book; one that will quite likely outlast both of us; It did not cost me a fortune. She can read her copy; I can read mine and the war between us that has been going on since we were in our early teens can continue.Bottom line...this is a good buy. And I must tell you, my wife was delighted with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I must start by admitting I did not get \\"Emma\\" the first time I read it. Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in herTime to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography(a wonderful piece of writing too). And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her. But aren't we all?The book itself is a kind of conjuring trick, and once you see that, it is impossible to ever see it again in the same way."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"These books are wonderful! I love feeling like not only am I reading a delightful classic but I am doing so with a piece of art. They are truly treasures on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was published in December 1815, when she was forty years old (just 19 months before she died). It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose. It has a poetic texture. Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry. The effect is immensely satisfying.She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively. Her main focus is on character. She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue. This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and televisionEmma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws. The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers. In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises. Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all. The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused. If you want good editorial input, choose another edition.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I greatly enjoyed this book. It's actually my favorite of Jane Austen's novels. Emma, to be sure, is a little frivolous and silly, but she's meant to be, as the book shows how she goes from hapless matchmaker to happily matched herself. The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period. Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot. The many misunderstandings and romantic confusions only add to the story. Give Emma a chance...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The title character of \\"Emma\\" is unique among the heroines of Jane Austen's novels. She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life. Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband. The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply. Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father. Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned. The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors. Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status. Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction. Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury. Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way. The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications. Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith. She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied. The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts. Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley. Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley. Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith. Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun. Austen wrote about the misfortunes of a high-minded philanthropist (\\"Emma\\" was perfectly translated into the 90's by the movie \\"Clueless\\"). In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it. If you are new to Austen then I recommend you start with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Contrary to another review, this book is not property formatted for Kindle.

The use of some of Austen's words and phrases from 19th century England (around 200 years ago) may make it somewhat incomprehensible for many readers, though. Since this book is focused more on characters than on the plot, and Jane Austen's own style is very elaborate, it tends to drag on with detailed descriptions of people and events. This can get very tiresome and tedious. So, if you're going to read Emma, you may need to save quite a bit of time because it might be necessary to read some parts a few times to understand them. Because Emma is such an old tale, there has been a movie made of it to make it easier to understand. Of course, it is not as detailed as the book, so the movie can not replace it. The movie Clueless, a modernized version, could also help decode some of the tough parts; just remember, watching it doesn't replace reading it; as characters were added, and names changed. Also, if you are looking for ways to create more effective characters in a story you may be writing, this would be a good story to find examples in. There are many characters who have very distinct and individual personalities in Emma. In this way, it relates to another of Jane Austen's novels, Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a long book with many creative characters, settings and plot twists.

As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but nave! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's \`beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,Make me a match,Find me a find,Catch me a catch,Night after night in the dark I'm aloneSo find me a match,Of my own.- Fiddler on the RoofIn this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the best plan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.

My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance. Was 'Emma' any different? Er,.. no.The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play. It is almost all dialogue. No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk. This makes for a very tiresome read.Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad]. Any dramatic moments are very tame. Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all. And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living. Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.So why bother with 'Emma'? Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature. She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time. True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done. But she was the pioneer. So please give at least one of her novels a try."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\""},{"Title":"Emma","review":"...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers. Perhaps these were fresh in Austen's day. That to one side, even the plot itself was too simplistic and much too easy to see through. These shortcomings combine to leave the reader with a sense of tedium. It does not \\"work\\" today, classic or not."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"IS THIS BOOK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CONSIDERED an......AR rated book.??..."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I appreciated the service I received.

This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about.

The characterizations are awkward, the plot contrived, and the prose is so roughly handled it makes a reader queasy. Pride and Prejudice at least had a little humor in it, but &quot;Emma&quot; has no redeeming qualities. I don't recommend spending your time on this one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Honestly, if I had not read Pride &amp; Prejudice first, I would have thought that I did not like Jane Austen's writing style. Emma is extremely slow to begin with though it picks up about half way through. The story centers on Emma Woodhouse, the unmarried daughter of a man obsessed with ailments to be potentially caught from drafts, rich foods and just about anything that is part of ordinary life. Consequently he does not go out (as a rule) and depends on Emma substantially for companionship and general well being. Despite his eccentricities, he is well loved by the community and is a very genial character. Emma, resolved not to marry, takes up matchmaking after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries friend and neighbor, Mr. Weston and Emma feels that she had contributed to making the happy union come about. Against the advice of family friend and mentor, Mr. Knightly, she \\"takes under her wing\\" a young girl at the local school to groom and bring out into good society in hopes of finding her a husband - specifically Mr. Elton of the vicarage. Despite her unknown parentage and lack of good expectations, Emma convinces the girl, Harriet Smith, to aim high in her expectations of a husband and to reject the advances of those of her natural social set in preference for a gentleman.This goes on for so long that I was convinced that this was going to be the whole of the book. Joyfully, though, the Mr. Elton angle blows up catastrophically and simultaneously several more interesting characters are introduced. The icily reserved Jane Fairfax comes to visit her grandmother and aunt before hiring out as a governess. Though she had been taken in by the Campbells and raised very genteelly along side their own daughter, she has no fortune of her own. The same age as Emma, they are expected to be fast friends but Emma's resentments of Jane's superior abilities and deportment do not bode well for this. Then Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother's death, comes to meet his new stepmother and makes a splash in Highbury society. Mrs. Weston has designs for Emma and Frank. Emma meanwhile has designs for Harriet and Frank. No one can figure out Jane's designs though Emma suspects improper attachments between her and her benefactor's daughter's new husband. Mr. Elton then brings in a new wife whose forceful manner and arrogant air threaten to turn everything upside down against Emma when Mrs. Elton tries to force a relationship as Jane's benefactress. Similarities between Emma's presumptions with Harriet and Mrs. Elton's presumptuous behavior with Jane are unavoidable and provide a relatively subtle irony.In this last half as the intrigues play out, the story takes on the flavor of Pride and Prejudice and becomes infinitely more interesting. Though the first part was slow, it did serve to really build the character of Emma and she becomes very real through her actions in the second half. It also serves to humanize Mrs. Elton's character to some extent while softening Emma's.This really is a very, very good book and I would have given it 5 stars except for how slow it was in the first half. A patient reader will enjoy this but readers who don't have patience with character studies or slow bits would do better to read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read another one of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &quot;tangle&quot; of plot than Pride &amp; P/Sense &amp; S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &quot;heroines&quot; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader.I highly recommend reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people. Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking. Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma. The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband. Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel. Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters. By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting. For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times. Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions. Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes. In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her. Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot. For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together. Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters. Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet. However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma. Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage. Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups. However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with. Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee. Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's. The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I loved Emma by Jane Austen. I think that the best aspect of Austen's writing is her witty irony that is featured in all of her books. I thought that Emma was a touching and funny story about a young woman whose lot in life is to play the matchmaker. She tries to fix the world to her own liking, but it does not work. Finally, she stops being so critical and realizes what is standing right in front of her. If you enjoy the book (which I think you will), buy or rent the movie starring Gywneth Paltrow. It is just as funny as the book. If that is not your fancied genre, check out Clueless, starring Alicia Silverstone. It is loosely based on the novel and also very funny, with a modern twist."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it.. After reading all of Nicholas Sparks novels, I decided to go in a different direction and read some classics.. I decided upon Jane Austen after reading reviews of her novels.. So I bought Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma.. I choose Emma to read first because I thought it would be less interesting than the others.. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this book, it's the best novel I have ever read.. Now I fear that the others will not be nearly as good as this one.. I agree with the others that the beginning is rather slow, but it picks up towards the middle so just stick with it! You will not be sorry.. I have no other words to describe this book other than amazing!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was a wonderful book. I think it gives Pride and Prejudice a run for its money because you get to see Emma grow as a person from being arragont to being kind.Now here is a basic Readers' Digest summary. Emma Woodhouse, a bright and wealthy young woman, and her father lose Emma's governess, Mrs. Weston(\\"poor miss Taylor\\") because she has gotten married. Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself. She then wants to be a matchmaker. However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother. The two become good friends. Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet. Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town. Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town. Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma. Many speculate the two as a perfect match. While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it. I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening! So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me. There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice. The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, &quot;flawed.&quot;The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were &quot;forced&quot; to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character &quot;Emma&quot; has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen's Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice. Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Highbury. She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman's journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone's lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen's characterisation is delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Dickens' characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen's dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED. So for those of you that cannot stand the thought of missing out on something that should have been left in (like me), just keep browsing for a different edition. I found out the hard way."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A good read.

And with a nice, if expected, twist at the end it's an antidote to some of the more gruesome love stories that seem to populate our bookshelves today like &#34;Gone Girl&#34; --- another great read, but a much different take on love/marriage."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by my response to this book. I had recently read (correction 're-read) \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" which undoubtedly rated Jane Austen's finest and has been a favorite of mine for years! It was actually one of the reasons I had delayed so long to start another by Austen for though I had heard great things about \\"Emma\\" (as well as others) I found myself very reluctant to start for fear of being disappointed. I was very bull headed in believing I would not like Emma the main character going into the story because I hate when female characters for lack of a better word \\"meddle\\" in other characters business. Boy was I wrong.I came to adore Emma and only wish I had not gone into the book so stubborn to dislike her! For this reason I am tempted to start reading it again without the previous false pretenses. So to those who were like me and are nervous due to what they have heard, please don't be! Nothing can compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but do not fear \\"Emma\\" because of it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"what to say about a Jane Austen title? You love it or you love it not.

She had insights into human nature that make her story meaningful today just as it was in the early 1800's.Emma is a beautiful and fortunate woman who has had only good luck. She thinks she knows it all. But really it's just she hasn't experienced the world. But this belief makes her get involved in the problems of others and disrupts her peaceful life. However it's not that serious, the results are comical and teaches you the important lesson to mind your own business!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"All through high school I stayed as far from the British female authors (of classical literature) as I could...and now I have to wonder why. I figured them to be drab, sappy, overly sentimental and trite. How wrong I was!

I immediately purchased \\"Emma\\" and was delighted. The character, as is mentioned, is flawed...but charming BECAUSE of these flaws. Emma is a wonderful character and the book is a joy to read. I will continue my journey through the books of Jane Austen--and I can't wait to continue!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I read Emma maybe a year ago, and I absolutely loved it! It's my favorite novel from Jane Austen followed by Pride & Prejudice. In fact I only like those two novels out of the six she wrote, but anyway, Emma was a really good read. The best part about this novel is that it isn't about a girl who is looking for love, it's about a girl who unexpectedly finds love where it has been all the time. Talk about right under your nose. Emma is friendly, kind, naive, smart, loyal, whitty, clever, innocent, and definatley worth reading. I truly love this book because I love romance in it's purest form, true love, when you know that these two characters will spend the rest of their lives together and will love each other faithfully! That's why I love this book, and Pride & Prejudice is the same way, maybe I'll write a review for that too, hope this helps you out, and buy the book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Highbury, England early 1800's a quiet and pleasant place to live. Where Emma Woodhouse takes residents with her father. Emma is clever and yes, rich. She enjoys many of the same things young adults do today do including match making and visiting friends in 1800's fashion.Emma is the main character as you probably can tell by the title of Emma. She has a bad habit of match making just ask \\"poor\\" Harriet. Emma attempts to stop threw out the book but always ends up going back. She vowed never to marry early in life. Besides her father Mr. Woodhouse needs her and she enjoys calling on her single friends. If she had a husband to complicate things she could not go see those friends. Unless the man she married enjoyed calling on those same friends.Emma seems like she could walk off the page and appear in the 21-century, even thew she lived in the 1800's. Her habits are the same as many young women today of not marrying and the dreaded habit of match making.Emma is full of personality even thew she can be a little mean to long time friends and not relies it without someone telling her. But Emma appears real and grounded.I would recommend Emma to young women who are fast readers and who know someone or they themselves enjoys match making. Because Emma learns control the desire to mess with people's feelings.Get Emma today even if you don't read it you can tell your friends you own on of the classics by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I first learned of 'Emma' by watching the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow - I was instantly captivated by the high-class style of that era, Emma's life and her relationship with Mr. Knightly. After watching the movie probably 16 times, I went and read the book and was so glad I did! It's become one of my all-time favorite books simply because I love Emma's character and get lost in her life and world every time, and come back later craving to read it again! The book expands and clarifies so much we don't get to see in the movie and gives you the original view of Emma - apart from the movie. As a woman, I love romance and tales of older times where nobility and class presided yet values were down to earth, respectable and loving. 'Emma' combines both nobility and the 'down to earthness' in Mr. Knightly. If you love romance, strong female characters and getting lost in another world of balls, dances, society - definitely read this and watch the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow! It's gorgeous and guaranteed to uplift you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though not her favorite novel, Austen's Emma shines as one of her most beloved. The character of Emma is both believable and lovable. This particular edition is a great keepsake, one you can pass down to your own daughter."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Because of its popularity, I believe the literary merits of &quot;Emma&quot; are perhaps overlooked. So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters. &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, as I do all of Jane Austen's works. The narrator is an interesting character, making comments on the action and people around her. I was surpised at how much the narrator disliked her heroine at the beginning of the story. The growth of Emma throughout the novel gives hope to every spoiled child or even prideful adult. My only regret is that I saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow (and even Clueless) before reading this. I think I would have enjoyed it even better not knowing what laid ahead. I highly recommend saving the movies for after the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted proteg&eacute;, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I purchased &quot;Emma&quot; about a year ago and finally picked it up about 2 weeks ago. I was engrossed in the story from the beginning. Although it does take patience to get through some of the less exciting parts of the book, it is a very enjoyable book to read. By the end of the book, these characters will feel like your own family. I learned a lot about English culture and about how the upper class families used to live. Jan Austen is a very good author and could be classed with the best of them. Oddly, this book has a strikingly similar plot as the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. After you read the book you will see a resemblance between Cher and Emma, Dion and Mrs. Weston, Elton and Mr. Elton, and Josh and Mr. Knightley. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While this isn't the only great narration of \\"Emma\\" available, I've enjoyed it for years. Prunella Scales' Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton are especially wonderful. Not every actor can do a creditable West Country accent, but Scales' redition of Mrs. Elton is one I recommend to people as just right. I think that you'll very much enjoy this version."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am currently reading Emma for my book club. I had to watch the movie to understand who certian people were but the book is even better. She is wity and funny. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When commenting about the brilliant Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is the most commonly discussed. Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works. Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer. Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire. Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived. In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates. Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society. Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live. This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance. Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money. It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority. I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable. I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma. I would most certainly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping. I am enjoying this book, what a great read! Thank you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma was the first Jane Austen book I've ever read &, originally, I liked it much more than Pride And Prejudice but I've since changed my mind. While I love this book, it's not my favorite anymore.Emma is such a fun character because she is so sure that what she's doing is right when all the while she's just making a mess of things. The best part about her is that when she sees that she is wrong, she can laugh at herself & learn from her mistakes.Mr. Knightly is one of my favorite Austen characters. His name says it all, \\"knightly.\\" He is the perfect gentlemen...possibly moreso than Mr. Darcy, even.The characters in this book, as in all Jane Austen books, represent both the follies & goodness in human nature, which is what I love about her writing. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend for anyone new to Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married. As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage. Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life. Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma. She knows what's best for everyone around. Emma fancies herself a matchmaker. In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess. And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying. She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate. She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers. What more could she want? But Harriet needs Mr. Elton. A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates. Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories. The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable. Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing. She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her. Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course. Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story. The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years. (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.) It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors. Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star. That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book. The rest is wonderful. You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men. Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course. He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth). If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start. You won't be able to resist reading her five other books. I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around. Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.I found this novel incredibly amusing! Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not the same Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature. Five stars!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and loving it I decided to read all of Jane Austen's works. 'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes! The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her. If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both \`EMMA' and \`PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time. In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking. She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there. Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady. There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case. Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events. One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed. Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've read it a million times, it was purchased as a gift for someone; but, since I never received the other two books, I didn't bother giving it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book arrived new and in good condition. I am going to try to read all of Jane Austen's novels. I have previously read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you love literature and you love needlework, this one is double the love. The book is timeless and the needlework cover will be as well. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece. I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read. As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease. It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.As the volume chapters are split, volume one makes for a very interesting read, as divided in between the chapters, we're almost immediately introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, and Emma's designs on how she plans to interfere in Harriet's relationship, and make her wed mr Elton, of Emma's choice, not mr Martin, of Harriet's choice. As she breaks up Harriet's relationship with mr Martin, we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but with Emma a lot less, and our opinion of her schemes, makes readers feel critical of her.In volume two, we sympathise with Emma a lot less than we are critical of her. On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one. By volume three, we get a better understanding of volume two, and the themes eventually link together, into something more conclusive. On first read, however, volume two can get quite tedious, and more put-downable as readers opinion grows colder towards Emma, because of how unfairly she breaks down Harriet's relationship, and also because of her prejudices towards miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.By volume three, our understanding of Emma grown warmer, as her feelings towards not wanting to ever be married begins to change, as her understanding of mr Frank Chruchill, and mr George Knightley begins to change. She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men. By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax, and we are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father was to a certain degree against this union of the two, believing that Emma had vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after Woodhouse, and not leave.If there were any further protests to the conclusion of who got married or not, or if there were ever any intentions for the centreing married couples to divorce, this is not identitifien by the author, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, centred about the characters getting married, and divorce is never a theme that has ever been explored in Austen's novels, even in less happier, eccentric, or less committed relationship.Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes in volume three."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton.

Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

However, I can recommend this one as it has a great ending."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The theme Jane Austen has in Emma aims to explore the psyche of an adolescent teenager who is past the blush of being a child, but could not cope with the traumas brought on by the war. It explores the emptiness of being without a mother, and at the same time the writer must be writing from the perspective of a young person who knew all the right things to say but coming out short. Essentially, Emma wishes to be the person who has given her birth, but is left alone with her \\"peacock-personality type\\" father who was constantly jealous of her mother's friendship while living. Her father could not survive the lost of her mother again, but at the same time, knowing this allows her to marry Emma to marry off Mr. Knightley, an equally jealous \\"peacock\\" man who would again retell the tale of her mother's marriage."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I was needing to read the book for a book club within a month.

Emma lives at home with him, looks after him and has no plans to ever marry because of this. She is a strong-willed and snobbish 20-year-old with a rather dull life who fancies herself an excellent matchmaker. Most of her friends and acquaintances indulge her. Only George Knightly, the elder brother of her sister Isabella's husband, John, is critical of her behaviour. He takes her to task for meddling in others' lives. As with all novels of this era, compared with today's offerings, the reader has to be patient and allow the story to build. There's also getting one's head around the language used. It took me a few instances of the word \\"nice\\" to realise that what it meant then (foolish, stupid, senseless) was not what it means today. The garrulous Miss Bates is a source of humour and there is plenty of talking at crossed purposes. This novel seems to point to the importance of status and appearance in Miss Austen's world.

I didn't know that Clueless was an adaptation of the classic novel until I read an article, and hey, the writer did a good job of updating Emma. 'Course, both Emma and Clueless are terrific and funny stories about the trials and triabulations of mediocre matchmakers.

Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous. Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times.

You will see Emma finding herself and becoming a better person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up.

This book put me to sleep every time I picked it up. It was dull and boring, this is only my opinion. I would not let this book effect and make me not want to read Jane Austen again. Since it is only one book out of many of hers. I felt this book was for a different crowd of people. Maybe I should have waited till I was older and grasped the concept more.Miss. Taylor Emma's good friend and governess get's married and move's out. Emma has no clue what to do with herself. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, gets upset and thinks Miss. Taylor now known as Mrs. Weston is making a huge mistake of leaving the family and things will never be the same without her living at the house. Emma then meets a girl named Harriet Smith, who is not as smart as Emma but she likes how she is willing to learn and listen to what she had to say. They went on daily walks around the town. Mr. Martin a very dull farmer that Emma's brother-in-law works proposes to Harriett who has had a crush on him before Emma tried to set her up with Mr. Elton. Emma influences her to refuse the offer of marriage, so she does. This was before n and got to know each other very well.Emma thinks she can match anyone up with love, if they gave her a chance. She herself has vowed to remain single. She tries to set Harriet, up with Mr. Elton, but Mr. Elton likes Emma instead of Harriet and wants to marry her. Emma refuses and Mr. Elton leaves and gets married to some person who nobody thinks is worthy of him. When Emma finds out Mr. Elton got married she doesn't want Harriet to find out since she is still hung up on him they found out Mr. Elton had married. Emma is very controlling when it comes to love, and this is one reason why I didn't like the book she aggravated me.Mrs. Weston's stepson is coming she is nervous he won't like her and confides in Emma. Emma is out for a carriage ride and she gets stuck. Mr. Churchill Mr. Weston's son comes and helps her get out, he doesn't tell her who he is till after and she is amazed by how good looking he is. She is confused with hr feelings for him after that. She thinks she may be in love but she doesn't feel like she is. Mr. Churchill likes a woman named Jane who is staying with Miss. Bates, a dear friend of Emma. Emma doesn't really like Jane since she always has one over her. For example at a party that was thrown they asked Emma if she would like to play the piano, when she is done Jane is asked to play the piano and everyone loved Jane's when people only like Emma's performance.At a picnic with Jane, Mr. Churchill, Miss. Bates, Mr. Elton, his wife, and Mr. Knightly, Emma's very good friend. Emma insults her friend, Miss. Bates. Mr. Knightly tells Emma off. Emma realizes she loves Mr. Knightly but is worried he loves Harriet. They secretly have feelings for each other but neither of them do anything. Finally they do confess there feelings and they get engaged. Harriet ends up with Mr. Martin and Mr. Churchill ends up with Jane.Mrs. Weston becomes pregnant and Emma does not want anyone to know about her and Mr. Knightly's engagement until the baby is born. Jane and Mr. Churchill are also keeping their engagement a secret.I couldn't really relate to this book. I would have done a lot of things different then what she did. For starters I would not have gone and meddled into every ones love life. Its their life and people need to respect that and not mess with it. I understand she thought she was helping everyone but truth be told she wasn't and it just was annoying to see how she kept going off and doing that throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Chemistry of Heterocycles: Structure, Reactions, Syntheses, and Applications (Thieme Flexibook)","review":"synthesis:2-aminepirydine"},{"Title":"Rumor Has It","review":"After being away from his hometown of Cedar Creek, Texas for ten years, Dylan Gates returns to open a law practice. As he comes back to resettle, local high school teacher Taylor Reed is leaving soon to attend Oxford on a graduate scholarship.Dylan is shocked to learn the kind rumors that have spread over what he and Taylor did when they were teens because none of that happened though he wished it did. However, when they see each other for the first time in a decade, Dylan realizes his adolescent dreams remain strong. Taylor decides that since everyone believes they heated the southwest with their ardor; she will do just that before she leaves for England. Using her high school days journal as a guide she leads Dylan on a sexual fantasy that blossoms into love, but he must convince her to give up one dream for a better dream.RUMOR HAS IT that this is a charming contemporary romance starring a fine hunk and a solid secondary cast. The heroine is the key to the tale, but though readers will like her, her rationalizations seem bizarre (does she really want sex just to substantiate rumors and is the choice Oxford or Dylan?). Still the audience will feel the Texas heat emanating from this affable duo whose romance is a blazing inferno.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rumor Has It","review":"Small-town highschool teacher wants to make true the sex rumors about herself & newly-returned Hero when they were back in high school. There is one condition & that their affair be purely a fling b/c she's leaving for Oxford in next few months.This Myers' book was just blah for me. It started out ok with Hero & heroine showing how they had feelings for each other in high school & still do 10 years later. Then, the romance pretty much died out as they just had sex in different locations. The emotions that Hero & heroine seemed to have at the start of the book got pushed aside & wasn't expanded on as they went through their sexcapade. So, when they begin realizing they were really in love with each other & wanted more of a commitment, I was not convinced.Slightly recommended for the interesting sex locations but not for the romance."},{"Title":"Rumor Has It","review":"I'm so happy that I took a chance to read this fun story! Rumor Has It was a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Christian Humanism: Creation, Redemption, and Reintegration","review":"At a time when Catholic higher education is struggling for its soul in the United States and elsewhere, Dr. Bequette has provided a handbook for how to do it right. He demonstrates, in this book, the sort of \\"integration of knowledge\\" so central to the project of liberal education. This integration is explicitly called for in \\"Ex Corde Ecclesiae,\\" and comes in the long tradition of thought exemplified in Newman's \\"The Idea of a University.\\" Bequette's book offers an authentic presentation of a Christian understanding of the human person, and of the way in which that understanding of the human person ought to inform a Christian (and, especially, a specifically Catholic) approach to liberal education. Additionally, it is phrased in clear and practical language the average college student should be able to understand. It is both nuanced and accessible at the same time. This book should be read by anyone who seeks to understand what the broad culture of Catholic liberal education ought to look like. It would make an excellent college-level text, or a fine study document for faculty and administrators at Catholic colleges and universities where the challenge of \\"Ex Corde Ecclesiae\\" is embraced as a positive call to authenticity."},{"Title":"The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth (Magic School Bus)","review":"\\"The Magic School Bus: Inside the Earth\\" immediately picks up where its predecessor, \\"At the Waterworks\\", left off. At the end of each book, Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen provide a subtle clue as to the nature and content of their next collaboration - a sly wink to those of us who catch such details.\\"At the Waterworks\\" concludes with Ms. Frizzle looking at a map of a volcano, which tells us the next book in the series will probably be about our world's physical structures. And that's where \\"Inside the Earth\\" steps into the spotlight. Written in 1987, Cole and Degen prove in their second effort that there is no such thing as the dreaded sophomore jinx. This story is just as, if not more, educating and entertaining than \\"At the Waterworks.\\"The book starts out with the kids in Ms. Frizzle's class appearing restless over their current learning topic, animal homes. They've been researching the subject for almost a month and \\"were pretty tired of it.\\" So the class jumps for joy when the Friz announces they're starting something new. \\"We are going to study about our earth!\\" she exclaims.However, things don't go exactly as planned. Only four kids actually bring their homework to class the next day - \\"Each person must find a rock and bring it to school,\\" said Ms. Frizzle. So she decides to take them on a field trip to collect rock specimens . . . and that's when the fun begins!Ms. Frizzle lives up to the expectations she set in \\"At the Waterworks.\\" By the time this field trip is done, her class has learned all about the physical features of the earth. The kids discover how rocks are made of minerals. They delve deep into the ground, getting up close and personal with Earth's crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. Ms. Frizzle educates them on the three classes of rocks - igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. She relates to the kids how processes inside the earth take millions of years. She even takes them on a tour through a volcano! All throughout the field trip, the class receives hands-on experience with various rocks - basalt, granite, limestone, obsidian, pumice, sandstone, shale, etc.And these details are only scratching the surface of what Cole and Degen, not to mention Ms. Frizzle, have lined up for readers in this book. Blending comedy with truth, this is a welcome addition to any children's bookshelf, either in the classroom or at home. And just as they did with their first story, Cole and Degen use the final pages to distinguish what things were accurate in the story and what things were made up.As is her fashion, Ms. Frizzle leaves readers a hint at what is to come in her next adventure. My guess is that it has something to do with the human body. Talk about an inside-job!Cole and Degen surpass the benchmark they set in \\"At the Waterworks\\" with \\"Inside the Earth.\\" There are facts and figures, hilarity and humor, bursting from every page.

The story-text of the original series is at once humorous, engaging, and packed with facts. Lively and amusing illustrations include cartoon bubbles, as well as &quot;reports&quot; by the students in the story. Ms Frizzle is a Mary Poppins-like teacher with oomph, and a wardrobe to match, who challenges and leads her students, recurring characters who reflect the multicultural nature of the US, on amazing fieldtrips.In INSIDE THE EARTH, the fabled bus turns into a steam shovel, provides the kids and the Frizz with workclothes and digging equipment, to explore to the earth\`s core, Jules Verne-style.

Well, this is one of those \\"big books\\", and it is filled with another Magic School Bus Adventure, called Inside the Earth. It's all about geology, and how the earth is formed over millions of years. Once again, Ms. Frizzle is taking her students on a bus for a field trip \\"inside the earth\\", to foster an appreciation for the earth's structure.As you already know, she wears clothes that match the experience; for instance, look at her shoes in this story: crocodiles with sharp teeth and starring eyes, rhinoceros heads and even archaeologist's boots. Even her clothes show what the field trip will be about. I remember a teacher who wore a lot of costumes so that we would be excited and interested about the subject; it worked.....I still collect rocks from places I visit.Well, this book is filled with genuine excitement, guaranteed to increase your heart beat and scare the fear out of you. (Now, is that possible, to scare the fear out of you?) There are side notes resembling children's assignments; there are various displays with vocabulary words to identify the objects. The adventure inside this bus to the earth's inside will have you reading to find out more about the fact and fiction in this book.

Miss Frizzle's classes are always taking wild journeys everyone. On minute they are in the classroom like a normal class, the next they are somewhere very unusual. In this book they traveled inside the earth to study about it. The book talks about all the things inside the Earth and there are great explanations to many questions that children might have about the earth.I like this book because it teaches children a lot about what the earth is made up of and it does it in such a way that children will stay interested and amused. A lot of children are really fond of science and things and this book teaches them about science in a fun way. Even children that don't really enjoy science would like this book because it's a fun book. Things happen that wouldn't really happen in real life so in a way it is fantasy like and a lot of children would like that.I think the author was trying to teach children something and do it in such a way that it is fun.

A lawyer and a skeptic, I was totally taken aback by author Edith Thayer and her engaging and documented walk through the art and science of astrology. How clever to examine the astrological chart of America and interface it with the fascinating and revealing charts of American icons Oprah Winnfrey, Bill Gates, and O.J. Simpson. You're spellbound by the stories and learning while you go. It galls me to think that major contours of our destiny were scripted by the time and date of our birth, but &quot;Stars over America&quot; makes and entertaining and convincing case to that effect.

Her insights into politics, cultural norms, and future trends are remarkable. In a larger philosophical sense, it is a brilliant example of showing how an individual life is connected to the whole.At the very least, this book will make you think!"},{"Title":"PROPAGANDA and AESTHETICS: THE LITERARY POLITICS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAGAZINES IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY","review":"Propaganda and Aesthetics: The Literary Politics of Afro-American Magazines in the Twentieth Century by Abby Arthur Johnson and Ronald Maberry Johnson explains how Afro-American magazines paved the way for black writers since the early 1900s. Magazines such as Voice of the Negro and Horizon gave black writers a place to be published where they could provide insight to readers in ways that they had not been able to do before. These magazines began with a focus on political and social issues, which eventually led to the creation of black literature. Six chapters tell the saga of American history, while Afro-American writers were focusing on issues that were important to them. American history along with the history of African American magazines showed that these magazines are now historical documents in their own right.Throughout the book, historical context is taken into consideration, with more emphasis given to significant issues. Historical information from the late 19th century sets the tone early in the novel and helps to understand and explain what was happening when Afro-American magazines were an upcoming phenomenon. The authors show how magazines were used to address the cultural attitudes and helped give a voice to those attitudes. They discuss the \\"function of black art\\" and whether this was racial propaganda or art with no racial bias. Publications change over time, from Voice of the Negro to magazines such as Crisis and Messenger that reflected the Harlem Renaissance. Themes changed to reflect Depression-era problems. A number of small magazines and special issues chronicled concerns for blacks through the early 1970s. Over the past century the names of the magazines changed but the focus and issues important to blacks always remained the same.The Afro-American magazines that addressed issues from the 1900s to 1976 are important to American history and should be considered historical documents on their own. It was interesting to read about the evolution of African American magazines and publications and how they fit into the American history timeline. As a whole, Afro-American magazines can be accepted at face value because they provide insight into a segment of society that has not had much of a voice over the years. The ideas of these magazines are interesting; and, while one may not believe every word in every story, it enhances the understanding of life for blacks in the 1900s.Propaganda and Aesthetics provides immense detail on how past publications have evolved to address issues for blacks. The book is divided into six chapters that discuss different topics in a chronological order. The chronicle is told mostly through quotes from significant writers, poets, editors, and important African Americans. This creates a very well-researched novel in which historical information was taken into account. The information provided through quotes, instead of through the authors directly adds depth for the reader. The quotes help explain the time period, changes made to publications, and the significant events facing blacks. The long quotes and continuous name dropping in a single sentence causes the reader difficulty in deciphering who is receiving the attribution."},{"Title":"Horses I've known","review":"I love Will Rogers tales of the west and horses.

But I was young and impressionable when I read it and it stood miles above the average paperback gothic of the period.The beginning is similar to that of Crocodile on the Sandbank, the book that later began her Amelia Peabody Emerson series. Her scholarly father dead, the heroine is setting out to make her own way in the world. However Master of Blacktower runs a more traditional course with a scarred employer whose reputation is not of the best, a remote Medieval pile in Scotland, not to mention, a missing (dead?) wife, sinister retainers and a mentally disturbed child (what happened to all of those traumatized children when they grew up?). However Michaels' irrepressible humor shines through at times. The predictable plot takes some nice twists and turns. The climax in a dangerous snowy landscape is nicely done.All in all-- not to be sneezed at."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"I have been familiar with Elizabeth Peters and her Egyptian mysteries, but I would have never guess that the woman can write some great stories under a pen name and live a double life of success! Master of Blacktower is cited to be a Gothic thriller but there is so much more to it than heavy, opulent furniture, gowns and language. Set in 1850's this tale is full of old fashioned virtues and the main heroine's way of breaking them.This is a tale reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast as another reviewer has said, where Damaris who has lost her father at a young age has decided to work as a librarian for Sir Gavin Hamilton. He a brute and barbarian with scars and wild hair who occupied a half demolished castle in Scotland and she a young and quite feisty female who wouldn't dream of living the low standard of having to marry and have as much voice as a piece of furniture in those times. She gave me quite a few chuckles but the real beauty was in the smooth flow of the story and the mysterious past that had Mr. Hamilton tangled up in and the reason for his acting in such a dark, haunted way.The mysterious disappearance and gossip about his missing wife, his crippled arrogant daughter, a castle with a black tower and full of distrustful servants were just a few of the main elements. The reader is taken on a journey of discovery and truth that has finally shone at the cold Scottish stones with the arrival of young Damaris. There were quite a few twists and turns and a lot of actions, I found myself totally enjoying this tale, reading for the entire lazy Sunday and wishing I had more of Mrs. Michael's books around. I adored the old fashioned way in which people dressesd and the hilarious way men told women what to do, what was even better was their discord when females had enough and got their way in most cases. I am sure glad I live in different times because with my snarly distaste for dictatorship I would have angered many men.This is a fun, fast read that leaves the reader feeling happy, full to the brim with love, angst and battles against surprising foes and ready for another tale such as this one. I mainly prefer horror, books about werewolves and psychos and this is probably considered to be fictional fluff but boy o boy I adored it, more please! As far as I'm concerned Barbara Michaels can spoon feed me her stories I think I will enjoy them all.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"This story is Barbara Michaels at her best. The story moves along fast and keeps you wanting more, you never suspect what the out come will be. There are many plot twists that will surprise even the most avid Michaels fans. This is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"The book is an excellent example of Gothic times and what people do for true love. This book just goes to show that love can happen anytime, anyplace, and to anyone! It is one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"Though this novel has all the charms, chills, romance, and mystery of Michaels' other wonderful Gothic pieces, it has a strangely rushed, abrupt feel that left me cold compared to her other novels. Though similar in length to her other works, the pace is choppy, and the reader is not as deeply drawn into the story. The two leads, Damaris and the eponymous Gavin, do fascinate and smolder with slow burning romance and character. Even the two of the servants, Betty and Ian, are intriguing, and provide a pleasant, if very minor, supporting influence. The real supporting players, however, left me scratching my head. Their presence, and the reactions to their presence, seem wholly untrue and poorly painted.In fact, many characters, like the spoiled daughter, Annabelle, are implausible sketches, not used to their potential best in the plot. (She is the duller, female version of The Secret Garden's Colin, in a random, ill-used plot line.) They are set up only to fall by the wayside as the narrative manages to both barrel and creep to a \\"resolution\\" of the slackest kind. Huge events occur without much impact. When action does occur, it seems forced an ill-fitting with the story.Shocking revelations are tumbled out at the last minute, and the end is the final jerk of a disintegrating rope. Not the kind of tug that startles the enchanted reader out of reverie, but the kind that leaves the reader holding a frayed end of a loosely woven story, wondering where the rest went.I am otherwise a huge fan of Michaels' historical Gothic novels. But The Master of Blacktower trails far behind, in desolate mist, the truly shining, exciting, yet similar, Greygallows, Black Rainbow, Wings of the Falcon, and the Wizard's Daughter. Of them all, I find Black Rainbow to be the best of the form, though I also sometimes reread Greygallows and the Wizard's Daughter. I wish she wrote more in the vein, but Victoria Holt keeps me happily supplied with historical Gothic revival fiction. From Holt, I highly recommend Night of the Seventh Moon, which I am thrilled is available on Kindle.Better yet, order yourself a shelfful (dusty old box full) of the original Holt/Carr paperbacks and hardbacks. You won't be sorry. Michaels' fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"I love Barbara Michaels! She is one of my favorite modern writers. I also enjoy her writings as Elizabeth Peters. The Amelia Peabody Mysteries have to be one of my all time favorite mystery series. I tend to save her books as Barbara Michaels for times when I need a good dose of a modern gothic. The Master of Blacktower has to be one of my all time favorite books by Barbara Michaels. Damaris Gordon hates the thought of having to go to work for the disfigured Gavin Hamilton owner of a isolated Scottish estate, but her father's death has left her with few choices for how to take care of herself. She begins to discover the truth about his wife's \\"mysterious\\" death and his daughter's crippling injury. Barbara Michaels is a master of blending all of the important elements of a Gothic Mystery into her novels. Gavin Hamilton is the perfect tragic brooding hero. This book is easy to savor over again."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"In my list of top five favorite books of all time this is one of them.

Not the most interesting characters but it has an intriguing story line."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"I should give up trying. Barbara Michaels undoubtedly has talent, but it's not on show with this book. This is a turgid, predictable, formulaic book, devoid of believable characters. It is, however, relatively well-written. She does know how to put words together. So if you are a fan of the gothic genre, and you care about English usage, you could do a heck of a lot worse.My first experience with Ms. Michaels was a little gem called &#34;Ammie Come Home.&#34; I had never heard of this author (this was several decades ago) and this was a super find. I've been looking for something from her of the same caliber ever since. I've tried half-a-dozen, with no luck."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"The reason I like gothic mysteries is because mysteries are my favorites and the gothics usually don't have more lust and explicit sex than mystery. If I wanted to read about lust and explicit sex I would buy a love story.

I have read 13 of them, and this one was quite sweet. It reminded me of Beauty and the Beast and I read it in 2 days because I simply could not put it down. So thats how beautiful I found this book to be. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the B & the B story."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"This was my first Barbara Michaels book,and won't be the last. She is a great author, spinning an exciting mystery/romance that had me buried in my kindle, ignoring the rest of the world until I could get to the end. I love her writing style - she is very articulate and descriptive. The story is told in the first person, and the heroine is both brave and funny, lending her perspective on the other very colorful characters, and I could be frequently found chuckling away as the story unfolds. Ironically, it is frightening at the same time, but not nightmare material.All in all, an excellent read. I only wish the story had continued- it ends a little abruptly, and I was left imagining what happened to the characters, as there were a few loose ends. But I would still strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"I have read many mysteries by Elizabeth Peters and am just getting to know her as \\"Barbara Michaels\\". This is a delightful mystery set in the mid-1800's that starts with a young woman left alone after the untimely death of her father. She is an independent woman and hires herself out as a secretary to a distant relative who lives in a ruin of a castle in Scotland. He is disfigured, has an invalid daughter, very strange servants, and no wife (that she knows of). Of course she falls in love with him, but there are secrets all around. The author drops lots of hints about the mystery, but I didn't figure it until the author revealed it. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower/Audio Cassettes","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

Most of it is presented \\"as is\\", so this is a compilation rather than an analysis. There are a lot of photos. They look like photocopies, so the clarity is not what might be hoped for. Still, this is a unique and information filled reference."},{"Title":"The American Railroad Network, 1861-1890 (The Railroads)","review":"Everyone who studies American railroad history needs a copy of The American Railroad Network 1861-1890. I own an orriginal copy, without any photographs, but this doesn't dimininish the value of this great work.Even a short railroad was an incretably expensive business, and so the early railroad builders didn't dream that it was possible for railroads to criss-cross the nation. So most of the early railroadds were built to help THEIR CITY trade goods with THEIR REGION. This resulted in a bunch of short lines that often deliberatly would not connect to a compettetors railroad. Yet, if someone wanted to ship goods across country, then the goods had to be unloaded, carted accross town, and reloaded. Sometimes goods would have to be unloaded and reladed many times.This book is the story of railroads learning to cooperate with each other in order to speed up the flow of goods and passengers. There are chapters on the problems of the three main regions, standerizing the rail guage, and another on the express rail business.The best part of the book are the three fold-out regional maps which clearly show all of the nation's railroads as of 1861. At that time, there were six different gauges (or widths between the rails) scattered about the nation. Each gauge is shown in a differnt color. This however, does not include the famous 3-foot Narrow Gauge that was so popular in the 1870s and 1880s."},{"Title":"The Rape of the Lock","review":"This poem serves two purposes. First, Pope wrote it in response to an upper-class quarrel over an event at a party in which a young girl had her hair cut. The incident itself was petty and stupid, but the families of the parties involved were taking it very seriously. Pope, then, wrote this poem in epic form (the most grand of poetic forms) to show the absurdity of the matter, and thus reconcile the offender and offended.That is the first function of this poem. Even though the incident is long forgotten, the poem is still very funny. But there is a greater purpose to this poem--it was written like an epic. It contains several epic elements--an epic battle (at the card game), the invocation of muses and gods, the epic quest (to cut the hair), and several literary devices, such as epic-length similes and catalogs. This is what makes this poem so great, and what serves as a testimony to Pope's remarkable genius for wit and satire.Pope was, in my opinion, one of the greatest English poets, certainly the greatest satirist. This is one of his greatest works, and it is short enough to read over and over again without investing too much time."},{"Title":"The Rape of the Lock","review":"This is a highly intelligent book on one of the finest poems by the eighteenth century's most celebrated poet. Brilliantly written with wit, style, and a flair for interesting detail, Wall's book includes textual information and a wealth of carefully selected secondary material that makes this &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for anyone interested in the work or indeed in the period. Because of its combination of lively writing and scholarly erudition, I would recommend Wall's book for a wide variety of interest and knowledge levels. Wonderful Bedford series idea and terrific book."},{"Title":"The Rape of the Lock","review":"This review should be taken seriously considering I didn't really like &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; and still give this book 5 stars!&quot;History is not a vacuum,&quot; one of my university history professors always told us. Neither is literature for that matter! This book examines the mock-epic poem &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot; in its social, literary, and historical contexts. The poem takes up a small portion of the book, and the rest is made up of diary entries, letters, essays, newspapers, etc. that help to explain the culture surrounding Pope. The city of London, clothes, card games, coffee, makeup, social norms, and countless other things are discussed in very readable and enjoyable ways in order to make &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; truly come alive."},{"Title":"The Rape of the Lock","review":"My version of the poem had a great introduction which explained what inspired the poem, which was a huge bonus for me! Alexander Pope's poem however was easy enough for me to understand, which I greatly appreciate. I particularly loved the description of the women being dressed at the end of the first canto. There was something so profound in the statement that the women take praise for looking good when it isn't them that look good - it was those that dressed them. Granted, I suspect that most women don't have someone dressing them these days; however, today women are so covered in makeup, and with the prevalence of plastic surgery and botox, I'm not sure that we really are making ourselves look good anymore, it's something else.Regardless, the poem was actually quite wonderful. Funny, quirky, and clever - overall I loved it! It amused me how he instilled this sense of impending doom and horror into a comedic poem about a woman's hair being cut off as a prank at a party. Knowing the back-story was tremendously helpful in this regard, it I had not known that it was written in response to a prank played at a party, I would have greatly misunderstood the poem."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"As with the other reviewers below, I agree that there are times in which I hoped that the directions would contain more information or that there would be more photos as to how to get into each pose.I think that this book, however is great and I have been using it the past couple of weeks to help strengthen my home practice. I like the fact that I need to actually \\"listen\\" to my body and become intuned as to whether or not I am in the right position for each asana.I often would do a yoga video at home and would often have to pause the video and go back to do a pose, or to slow it down so that I could experience a pose longer. I hated doing that because I always felt that:a: I was cheating my body out of experiencing a pose fullyb: I was going to injure my body because I wasn't moving according to what my body was telling meSo, I am in a happy medium with this book currently because I can go as slow or as fast as what my body is telling me to do at the time.I was also happy that he included a couple of pages on following a \\"moon practice\\" while you are menstruating. Many times the videos would tell you not to do \\"inversions\\" and if you're a beginner or only do yoga at home and never take a class in a studio you don't know what an inversion is. I'm not a beginner, but sometimes it's just nice when something is spelled out for you.Overall, a great book and well worth getting!"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This book is incredible.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I did enjoy the other book, but this book blows it away! The pictures are more clear, the instructions and modifications make it more doable and I don't miss some of the annoying writing in the other book! I've gone through all 8 weeks and found that this book helped to deepen my current practice. Excellent class sequences and themes and just a lot of good advice.

Rodney Yee is certainly not hard on the eyes either."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Although it is important to have a teacher, and also to get input from other sources, this was my book for learning yoga. I did the full 8 week journey and often use the book to lay out a daily practice to help me focus on various aspects of the asanas.

I can't help but smile while writing this review thinking of how well the information is conveyed and how poetic the forwards of each chapter are. It takes you through Rodney's version of the beginning (preparation) through a fluid series of postures with room to customize. Each chapter builds from the last. I find most useful the explanation of the kramas (stages of the pose) for the asanas. There is a photo for each asana as well as a description of what to do in stages. Whether you are beginner to advanced, injured or weak to optimal fitness; the elements of each asana are broken down in a no nonsense way. It's available for everyone where ever they happen to be. If you can breath, you can benefit from the posture.

He eventually moved from full-time ballet to full-time yoga instruction.Yee's book offers valuable tips for staying motivated to do a daily yoga practice at home. Yee says that true power and knowledge of yoga's potential comes from a consistent home practice. He offers many pointers on how to gain maximum benefits from a home practice. I especially like his guidance on how to create an inviting space in your home for your yoga practice. He also explains in detail the many benefits--physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional-- that you gain from a consistent home yoga practice.

This 8-week practice is intended for students who have only done yoga as a \\"paint by numbers\\" experience (e.g., gone to classes and done what the teacher tells you to, followed yoga DVDs). The goal is to teach you the skills and confidence you need to do yoga on your own. No audio-CD, no book listing a routine, no teacher, no DVD -- just you doing yoga on your own initiative. This is very freeing!The format of this book is an 8-week program. The first day of each week is a longer yoga workout (about 1-hour) where you try out three versions of about 20 poses. You are encouraged to try each version, if you judge it safe to do so, and see which ones are appropriate for you, and which ones will have to wait until you are more flexible. The next four days are faster workouts (about 30-minutes) that focus on learning about one type of yoga move (e.g., a week concentrating on backbends). The sixth day is devoted to relaxation and mediation. The seventh day you rest.At the end of 8-weeks, the expectation is that you have the knowledge and ability to make up your own yoga routines!The exercises described herein are the standard yoga poses (e.g., downward facing dog, tree pose, triangle pose). The full pose is presented, along with an easy and moderately difficult variant, for people who cannot yet do the full pose. The book has you to try all three, and then choose the one that you find suitable. A chapter toward the end describes how to make your own routines, now that you better understand the poses and your capabilities.The title credits Yee only, but the cover and intro also credit a second author, Nina Zolotow. The pictures are all of Yee, and very nicely done. Nina and two other yoga practitioners had students try out this 8-week course to fine tune details before publishing.I'm part way through with my 8-weeks yet. I'm very impressed. This is exactly what I need to teach me how to make my own yoga routine, and to build the confidence I need to do it \\"myself\\" instead of waiting for a class or blindly following a DVD. Until I started on this 8-week course, I didn't even know I wanted this!A nice compliment to this book isAnatomy of Hatha Yoga: A Manual for Students, Teachers, and Practitioners. It contains detailed instructions describing how your body should be positioned in each pose. As such, it provides the \\"missing details\\" that some reviewers wished were contained herein.I highly recommend \\"Moving Toward Balance\\"."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I have bought a number of yoga books and videos over the years, many of which sit unused on my shelf. I find this book to be completely inspiring. It makes me want to practice at home. Seeing the many beautiful pictures of Rodney's perfect form helps me tremendously. I would not recommend it for a complete beginner, because I think you should have a basic familiarity of the poses so you don't hurt yourself. But for someone who has a basic knowledge of the poses and has been putting off practicing at home, or doing more challenging poses at home, like me, this is a wonderful book. I like that you can go at the pace of your own breath rather than trying to keep up with a video. Thanks Rodney and Nina for a great job!"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Incredible book. For the past 10 years, I've practiced yoga on and off. Usually attending classes or following DVDs. Never could quite get practice done at home, by myself. But this book changed all that. Yoga has truly become something different to me now -- it's incredible powerful to practice solo at home. You go deeper and challenge yourself in new ways. (Sounds cliched, but true.)Probably not ideal for beginners, but if you've been practicing for a bit it'll be just fine. It goes into lots and lots of details for each pose. Amazing book!"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I love this book. I'm on week 6 and it is changing my life for the better. I actually bought this book about 3 years ago, put it on a shelf, forgot about it, and never used it until 6 weeks ago. I felt inclined to write a review due to the life changes I have been experiencing in this short time. This book is a great guide and well organized. I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn yoga who is trying to start a home practice and is frustrated or overwhelmed with trying to understand yoga from just group class instruction. Classes have their place and motivation. But, classes also have their frustrations. You will never really learn yoga unless you start a home practice. This book will definitely help you.This paragraph provides personal background of my previous experience, joy and frustration with yoga. I have taken yoga classes on and off over the past 2 to 3 years after a medical recommendation. During this time my attendance had been spotty at best; better over certain periods while almost non-existent during other periods of time. A busy life and demanding business travel prevented the consistency I wanted. Yoga instructors recommended starting a home practice, but I could never remember how to do more than a few poses at home or while in hotels on work; never a series or breathing pattern. While classes provided me an idea of yoga, I could not really learn it. I usually felt some relaxation after the classes, but honestly, I also felt frustration at times trying to keep up, understand, and remember what we did. Only a few times did an instructor provide personal attention in a class of 30 to 40. I would watch the instructor and those around me who seemed to know more. I would try to mimic. I would be behind and many times confused. I could not understand the breathing. That was my class \\"learning\\" experience. After a bad soccer injury, I had to stop and eventually gave up on yoga. During a home spring cleaning, I came across this book, \\"Moving Toward Balance\\". Since my leg injury had healed, I decided to give this yoga book a chance and it has made all the difference. I'm thankful I did not throw it out in the Spring cleaning.\\"Moving Toward Balance\\" takes you through yoga poses in an almost methodical building block pattern. If you continue to follow Rodney Yee's instruction, you quickly find yourself understanding the poses. More importantly, the series and breathing patterns begin to click or fall into place as the poses build upon each other. I not only understood the order of mini and full Sun Salutation series by week 2, but I finally understood how to properly breathe; when to inhale and exhale in the progressive series of poses. I never fully understood this after years of on/off yoga class attendance. The pictorial guidance is great. Poses are always shown in sets of 3 (easy, medium, and full pose) for you to appropriately select your current ability.Why did I say life changing? There are many positive effects of yoga. However, I never fully experienced them from class instruction. Why? I could never learn sufficiently to practice at home or on the road. And, even attending 2 classes per week, at my best attendance record, was never enough. And, usually I could not make it that often. It was practicing 6 days a week that made the difference. This book made it possible.What was one of the biggest benefits? My sleep patterns improved and I feel better rested. Since I can remember (30+ years of my life), I have always felt groggy and tired in the morning. I would sleep in at every chance, hit snooze for about an hour on workdays, and be late in the mornings. I wrote it off that I was not a morning person. And, my company accepted it since I still got the job done. Since following this book, I have been waking up around 6:30am every morning for the past 5 weeks. I have been waking up before my alarm clock! My family and friends cannot believe it. I even have more energy. I think a lot of it has to do with the breathing/meditation guidance in this book.Thanks Rodney Yee and Nina Zolotow for making this book and giving me a new outlook on life! Gaiam, make a Kindle version of this book. It's heavy! And, I'm tired of carrying it through airports and to hotels on my business trips."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I got this from the library and did the poses for a couple of weeks before buying it from Amazon. It is really the perfect practice for me. I like the almost daily schedule and that each day is different. I like the way the week builds to the harder poses. What I like the most is that, since it is not a DVD, I need to count and breathe on my own for the recommended times to hold each pose. The counting and breathing alone is very meditative for me. I'm nearing the end of the 8 weeks, but I'm planning on starting from the beginning again rather than create my own practice. I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Rodney Yee's book Moving Towards Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee is the most helpful resource I have come across for consolidating a home yoga practice. You do not need to be an Iyengar student to benefit although he does use props such as blocks, a bolster, belt and blankets (you can make do with items from around your house) but you do need to be open and willing to try variations on well-known asanas. Yee encourages this experimentation with the poses to gain an understanding of what works for you at the stage of yoga you're working at, and also to reinforce connections between different postures.The book presents an 8 week home course that requires 6 days a week of practice (around an hour a day), but if you cannot practise 6 days it is perfectly fine to practise less frequently and just take longer to complete the course (skipping bits is a no-no as you won't experience the same benefits). The postures are broken down into standing poses (week 1), sun salutations (week 2), backbends (week 3), twists (week 4), inversions (week 5), forward bends (week 6), headstand (yikes! week 7) and then several sequences that incorporate the poses learnt previously in a balanced way (week 8). The next section is the icing on the cake: information about how to create your own personal home sequences and how to customise practices to suit your needs.Is this a book for everyone? Well, I'm not sure that it's ideal for beginners, as there is not much information on how to get in or out of poses, or on what is important for 'correct alignment'. It also tackles some difficult postures such as headstand. But for experienced practitioners who are confident in the postures it is an excellent resource to learn how to put sequences together, so that you can practice well between formal classes. It is also important to note that this book is very much focused on asana practice, with just a little breath awareness and meditation thrown in.An excellent addition to your yoga bookshelf!Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Moving Toward Balance is a wonderful book!I am a long time fan of Mr. Yee. His videos have been the basis of my home practice - a chance to repeat and practice poses first learned in class. They provide visual and verbal details in a context that helps understand how the pose should \\"feel\\". But, I could never put together a routine for my needs today.The book is organized around the concept of \\"balance\\", and I have learned from it that balance opens a world of choices. If yoga is a means to freedom of choice, then the choices can be expressed as balance. For example, the balance between observing and doing is a lot like the balance between yoga and earning a living or between meditating and active practice, or between breath and one's lower back, or between forward bend and hand stand.Freedom in life is limited by the choices we see. In Moving Toward Balance Rodney Yee shares his philosophy of freedom in a completely approachable way. Most poses are described in three versions and he tells us what to expect from each. He discusses the ways outcomes are improved through different combinations of poses, how the book can be used to create a personal practice, and, of course, how to increase the number of choices.I now know why I could never plan a yoga practice - I didn't know what the choices are. Mr. Yee leads us to discovering them and I am much happier. You will be too."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This book is profusely and clearly illustrated. Each position is presented in three variations for beginner, intermediate and advanced practitioners. I also have some of Rodney's DVD's which show how he moves. I find it helpful to think of him as the Michael Jordan of yoga. I don't expect I will ever dunk like Jordan nor will I yoga like Yee. But his actions are clear and I am guided into further practice by his materials, adding a new asana every so often."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"As an enthusiastic beginner with less than a year of classes, I surprised myself by methodically completing the entire 8-week cycle in about 10 weeks. Each morning's lesson was a treat - though the first day of each week took me about 2 hours so I had to divide it up.This book would be worth it as a useful and complete resource book -- but to actually go through the exercises in sequence is a wonderful experience. I feel much more confident and grounded in my home practice now."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Guys have you not seen so many western yoga books intellectualizing and analyzing aspects and giving tips like the angle should be 27.5 degrees, dont do if you have head ache - I was like what are these guys doing? it is so refreshing to read Rodney Yee's book - it is a Gem. No unneccessary disclaimers, contraindications, warnings that drive people way from even thinking about starting a practice. This is one of the best western books written on asanas.If you are a beginner - for every asana he has given three versions - just do the first version and you are good."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"As a new yoga student, I find Yee's work helpful and most instructive. He gives rationale behind each of the poses, and offers a bit of coaching for the neophyte as to how to align and anticipate each asana. I feel it best to not rush through this book, but to savor it, page by page. Why would anyone want to hurry up through such a great 'body feel good experience' as yoga has turned out to be? The book is hefty, well done, and it has many, many illustrations, which are easy to follow. This is also another mat companion for your personal 'time on the mat'."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I am a beginner and have really enjoyed this book. What I like is that you can be as involved as you want or just do the basics. Some of the information can be overwhelming but you just have to read and take from it what you can. After you go through all 8 weeks you can go through the book a second time and gain more knowledge about yoga than you did the first. A wonderful book GREAT price!Just make sure that you can give 30 min to an hour to yoga most days. I found that this wasn't hard because I really looked forward to my \\"sessions.\\"Just like anything new, it's awkward at first and you are worried \\"am I doing this right?\\" \\"how do i look?\\" but as you move through the first week you gain an amazing confidence and realize to listen to your body for form and what is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\""},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"The book by the amazing Rodney Yee is easy to follow.

It presents the ancient discipline in which physical postures, breath practices, meditation, and philosophical study that are tools for achieving liberation as a way to lead you to your own innate, ever-changing balance.The bulk of this book describes poses that are introduced by categories each week of the program. I liked how the poses are shown with variations to accommodate different levels of strength and flexibility. The text has many photographs, all in color. While some of these pictures are pretty small, you can still see the pose Yee is illustrating and imitate the pose yourself.If the book only provided the poses, it would still be a good book. However, it also provides information regarding living in balance and in the third part information on customizing your practice. This is the chapter I really found useful. It is a very short chapter, but one I think is important because everyone needs to customize their practice to meet their own personal goals for practicing yoga.In an ideal world, everyone would be able to practice with a qualified instructor. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. For whatever reason, if you can't work with an instructor, Yee's book will enable you to learn and incorporate yoga into your own life. The book has an emphasis on home practice and encourages you to work on what works best for your own body.If you are fortunate enough to attend classes with a qualified instructor, this book makes a great supplemental aid for bridging what you do in class and home. Regardless of you experience level, this book has a lot to offer. I also believe this book combined with DVDs is even better. Sometimes it benefits to see how Yee gets into the poses, rather than just the finished position. I know Yee has a lot of DVDs out, I personally have 6 or 7 of them. The combination of this book with DVDs provides a lot to practice. Even if you don't get any DVDs, I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to incorporate yoga practice into their lives.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I like everything Rodney Yee does, but this book isn't really teaching you to get there in 8 weeks either (not that I believed it)."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This is a great guide for any participant. Very thorough and descriptive. I love it."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Things I like about the book:1. It's incredibly beautiful! I love LOOKING at it, and it's inspiring.2. He talks about emotional aspects as well as physcial ones, and gives you good information on anatomy, aspects of the asanas, and building a practice for yourself.3. The structure of the course in general is excellent, and there is a great deal of knowledge put into each sequence. He has good reason for placing asanas in the order he has.4. The photos make it easy to follow the daily sequence5. He offers alternative postures for every asana.WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BOOK:1. It seems like a book a beginner could use, but as a long time practitioner/instructor, I find it falls short with simple things like positioning of the feet or the hips in certain asanas.(eg. Trikonasana requires that hips are facing the side and the rear foot should be at a 45degree angle, etc)2. The meditations don't give much for a beginner to go on, and seem flimsy at times for those who do have experience. It could quickly frustrate a beginner or turn them off from an essential aspect of a full yoga practice.3. There are no warnings about postures that are potentially dangerous for beginners, or information about postures like back bends, that for many people may take years to work up to.4. Frequently the alternative postures are too difficult for students with limited abilities and the presentation implies that the alternative is the 'easy' pose.If you are a beginner, or are not confident with your own knowledge of asana/the physical body...please, please, please find a qualified person to take you through DAY 1 at least. This will give you solid knowledge about which postures are feasible for you at the present moment and which ones you should alter.Don't be afraid to stray slightly from the book....you don't need to do every posture he recommends...some of them will only create injuries if you force your body into something it's not ready for.Having said all this, I will say I am living in the Middle East in the middle of the desert and I am using this book as a base text to teach a number of expats in my community. We are all enjoying the program...but I've made several key changes:i)I've added basic breathing practices(pranayama); ii)I've removed postures that are too difficult and substituted them with something more appropriate for beginners; iii)I've changed the meditations and frequently change the suggested postures for the meditations.When it's all said and done, personally I really like the book, and recommend it to anyone who has experience with asana classes, and is at the point of wanting to establish a home practice. This book helps you lay a great foundation of 'asana knowledge' that will ultimately allow you to create a personalized practice suited to your needs. However, I have more than 10 years of knowledge and I found that I frequently supplemented with my own knowledge to make my experience more fruitful and pleasurable.If you buy this book, make sure you also get a book on pranayama/breathing....Like Donna Farhi's book for example and one on meditation...like Lawrence LeShan.If you want to create a full practice, it's important to incorporate all aspects of yoga, not just asana."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"After having done yoga on and off for the past three years, this book really helped me incorporate yoga into my every day life. I have taken yoga classes and practiced with numerous videos, but it never really felt like &quot;my own&quot; until I started using this book eight weeks ago. Not only does doing yoga every day revolutionize how your body feels, but the workouts are extremely well-developed and enjoyable. Yee's pictures and explanations are incredibly helpful and encouraged me to do things (ie: backbends, handstands, and headstands) that I never thought I'd try by myself at home; I always felt safe and prepared for the poses. I cannot say enough good things about this book. I actually look forward to doing yoga every morning. I feel like Yee has prepared me to practice at home much beyond the eight weeks he promises. I will never do another video; I enjoy too much looking out my window, listening to my music, while doing yoga at my own pace. Thank you Rodney Yee!"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I really loved this book. I've just finished the 8 week program - it took me more like 10 to get through with my schedule, but I loved the organization of it.. each week has a different focus, and every day within that week a different angle on the week's focus... there are different versions of each pose so that you can really see how the placement of the body matters. the pictures were quite good and in the end, you have yourself weeks of practices that you can comfortably reconfigure over and over. this is a slow moving practice; generally you hold each pose for 30 seconds to several minutes. it covers a really wide range from standing poses to inversions. I really feel that I can just turn on some music, lower the lights, and comfortably make my own home practice on the fly of any length."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Rodney has written a must have book for all students of yoga. His ability to make the yoga practice understandable for all levels is first rate. This book breaks down a week by week practice to help all of us understand barriers to practice. This book is extremely helpful for those starting a home practice and for new teachers who wish to help thier students."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This book is outstanding for someone like myself who has a little over a year of Yoga and somewhat of a foundation of the asanas.Part of what Rodney asks us to do in this visually appealing, thoughtfully put together instructional book, is to do the asanas from different perspectives - from modified to advanced. And even if one feels confident and believes they can just move to advanced - wait - follow Rodney's advise and do it all. You are not taking one step back when you follow his execution of a modifed version. Instead, you feel the asana from a different perspective that helps you understand the movement even better, making it more meaningful for your practice when you do move to the advanced version. His teaching method allows one to further discover the benefit and beauty of these asanas (and therefore Yoga as a whole).I love this book - of the many DVDs and books I have bought over the last year, this is truly the most valuable Yoga purchase I've made to date.Nancy - New York, NY"},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"For those of you who want to practice yoga at home, this is a wonderful book. Videos can become very monotonous, but this book encourages personalizing your practice. Throughout the eight week program, the different poses are presented in clear photographs and descriptions with different versions of each pose for different levels. The book moves from the more familiar sun salutation to the more intimidating handstands, backbends and such. There are sequences to familiarize the reader with the poses and sequencing. The book includes specific meditations at the end of each day's work. At the end of the book there is advice about creating your own sequences.It is a wonderful book for doing yoga at home and personalizing practice."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book with a nice sequence of practices that build up to more advanced routines. There are also many preparatory exercises for difficult asanas and even sequences of asanas to improve body awareness before moving to more advanced positions. I really like this aspect of the book and a lot of this information is well presented.What I didn't like about this book is that I don't think it offers enough warnings or fine points on asanas for beginners. While the routines take things slowly and build up to more advanced positions, it would actually be a monumental task for a beginner to reach these levels without a good teacher because the book lacks sufficient detail. However, it could be adequate if you have a good teacher or attend regular classes with a qualitifed instructor.I'm glad I bought this book and I have used some of the ideas from it in my practice. However, I would augment it with something like \\"The 30 Essential Yoga Poses\\" by Judith Lasater which provides more detail and warnings on performing asanas correctly or \\"Dancing the Body of Light\\" which goes in to great detail about the asanas.If you have a bad back, then I would start my yoga practice out with \\"Back Care Basics\\" by Mary Pullig-Schatz. She is an Iyengar instructor and M.D. with lots of experience using yoga to rehabilitate people with various types of neck and back problems. In fact, this is how she became involved in yoga."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I thought this book was great because it has so many different routines; you never have to do the same routine twice throughout the whole eight-week program, and every week you get to learn new poses. Also, the way the program is designed you really improve quickly, each week is a little more difficult than the week before it. After completing the program I felt like I knew tons of poses, and could easily keep up with many yoga classes. I really liked doing yoga from a book more than from a DVD because it gave me enough time to make each pose feel right for myself, I really learned to control my breath and set my own pace. If you are really interested in making yoga a daily part of your life, this book is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I think that this is THE book for beginners. I have tried many DVD's and other books, and this is the best. It is really an 8 week introduction to basic yoga. The book starts with the easier standing poses, and works from there. Each week you begin by trying the poses featured that week three ways: first, you try the pose the easiest way with props and supports (like blankets, yoga bricks, a wall or chair for balance, etc.); the second way is with a little less support; and the final way is the pose without support. This is a great approach, because it allows you to do the yoga at your pace and ability: you can do the tree pose holding onto the wall if need be, bend your knees during downward dog, do a modified backbend without lifting your head and shoulders off the floor, and begin headstand (much later in the book) by walking your feet up the wall, etc. This is much better than jumping into a dvd where you are already supposed to know how to do it. After you have tried all the poses with modifications, and without, if you are able; the rest of the days of the week feature two poses each in particular to focus on, along with review. Everything is covered in detail with pictures, all the poses, with modifications and without, and how to do a sun salutation and so on. The pictures are beautiful and clear and the book is written in Rodney Yee's encouraging style. Best of all, you can take your time getting into a pose and do not have to worry about keeping up with a dvd. I have no experience in yoga, and I love this book. I am 38 years old."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This book was recommended to me by an instructor whose class I took while on holiday. I had taken classes for several years and done some home videos and was looking to develop a home practice. This book is an excellent way to begin the process. The program is well organized and there are many modifications shown for the different poses. One cautionary note: it does help to have some prior experience. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to establish a home practice."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"This is a beautiful book, quality paper, the teacher has an engaging look, the photographs are inspiring, the print is clear and highly readable. The whole thing just looks pretty scientific with its varied schedules, programs and tons of advice on minor details (how to fold your yoga rug).So, when I received the book and glanced at the content, I was quite happy to have bought it, until I came to realize that all the postures in the book are shown and analyzed only in their FINAL STAGE. This sounds incredible but the fact is that nowhere does one find a description of the different movements one has to do before one finally takes the \\"perfect\\" posture.My original intention had been to give the book to a friend who is starting to learn yoga, but when I noticed the problem I've just mentioned, which is quite serious, I simply had no other solution than to put the book on a shelf and just leave it there.Let me also warn potential buyers that the book only presents the most elementary asanas (postures), the ones one finds everywhere in other books or on the Internet. For me, who has practiced yoga on and off for many years, there were only one or two postures I didn't know, but since they were difficult and the author didn't explain how to do them, well...I just had to give up.Maybe there are people who will find the book useful because it tells one how to arrange a personal sequence of asanas and gives lots of advice on various topics from nutrition to meditation, but for me this book has proven to be The Big Amazon Book Disappointment of the Year!PS:I am sad to report that I haven't found a single good yoga book until now, with the one notable exception of those written by Belgian author Andre van Lysebeth (unfortunately his books are apparently not available in English) and I am not willing to throw good money after bad."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"I bought this as a Yoga beginner, but I would be able to choose one more time, I would rather to buy a DVD instead of a book. It's a good book, detailize every single post as well as the important points, however, to just follow is hard cause you're doing the post, and you need the next post, DVD would solve this problem. But don't get me wrong, it's a good book."},{"Title":"Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks of Yoga with Rodney Yee","review":"Consider these quotes from the preface of _Moving Toward Balance_:\\"You move toward balance in your mind because in your practice you learn to focus more and more on the present moment. This moves you away from a judging mind and toward a mind that is constantly noticing and adapting to what is taking place, creating a sense of contentment with things as they are.\\"-- _Moving Toward Balance_, p. xiii.And again:\\"To be present in whatever arises, I believe we must not only be aware of what is arising but we must also be able to see all things that arise as equal, with detachment.\\"-- _Moving Toward Balance_, page ix.In his coverage of asana practice, Yee comes across as earnest and sincere -- in his DVDs too. But the amoral pronouncements in the preface of this book left me wanting to get off the train at the next stop.Would Yee really consider it equal, for example, to find himself in a war zone, a slum, or a prison cell rather than, as on the book's cover and in his DVDs, demonstrating yoga practice on a nice beach in Hawaii? Is he just as unconcerned about other people too? Where is human kindness to be found in this approach to life?Other reviewers have commented on Yee's getting too advanced with the asanas; perhaps he also gets ahead of his readers with yogic philosophy. Joseph Alter's bookYoga in Modern India: The Body between Science and Philosophycites Ian Whicher as explaining that yoga transcends comprehension, because that is rooted in the senses and located in the intellect; yoga then can't be understood till true understanding is achieved. Perhaps Yee speaks from this standpoint, but then how can he expect readers to understand him!?I accept the lessons of yoga of approaching situations as they exist, with equanimity, and being present in addressing them. But I find the assertion that all situations may be regarded as equal to be profoundly alienating and antisocial.OK, I said it. Now, should I offer apologies for being judgmental?Let's look into another tradition and see whether it offers some useful counsel. Jesus of Nazareth said, \\"judge not, lest ye be judged.\\" Good thought, but on the other hand, Jesus also threw over the money changers' tables in the temple.I suppose I'll just have to approach that apparent contradiction with equanimity, and leave you with another favorite quote, from Dr. Martin Luther King:\\"Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted.\\"I'll take some comfort, if not in the promise of salvation, at least in the challenge."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"West's account of Los Angeles is a brilliant counter to the happy, celebrity-filled portrait of Hollywood that pervades the American consciousness. One of the most wrenching indictments of Hollywood culture, it is as applicable today as 60 years ago. A short, superb book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"What \\"The Day of the Locust\\" lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in character development. This short but powerful novel is about the Hollywood of the 1930s. It's a third person narrative that describes it's subject matter, largely though not exclusively, from the point of view of Tod Hackett, a fledgling set and costume designer newly arrived from the east.As author Nathanael West tells it, Hollywood and California in general is not so much a place as it is a destination. A destination not only for those seeking fame and fortune in movies, but for those yearning to restore their physical, mental and spiritual health. Personifying the latter group is a repressed Iowan with the improbable name of Homer Simpson. Tod becomes acquainted with Homer because of their mutual infatuation with a beautiful but vapid would be starlet named Faye Greener.\\"The Day of the Locust\\" is a skillfully written novel notable for its fascinating cast of characters and its vividly descriptive prose. Written nearly 70 years ago, it has weathered the test of time and passed with flying colors."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"The movie industry is the draw and an incredibly odd collection of characters find themselves living marginalized lives in the shadow of early Hollywood. Their lives interact in a series of bizarre scenes fueled primarily by lust for the one female character who is completely self-absorbed and has somehow transformed the attention from men she encounters into her own fanasy version of celebrity.There is a dark undertone of violence that finally erupts in a random and surprising way that sems to be a rebellion against the perversion of reality that Hollywood represents.Not a great book..but a memorable one."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Too bad Nathanael West didn't live long enough to work with the Coen Brothers! Instead he wrote screenplays for B-grade films in a Hollywood that considered language an obstacle to art. Luckily he also found scraps of time to write five novellas and a couple of stories, and two of those novellas - Day of the Locust & Miss Lonelyhearts - are in a class by themselves, the most original and incisive American fiction of the 1930s.Day of the Locust is a wild and willful satire of Hollywood and the film industry, a Coen Brothers film in very well-crafted prose, killingly funny and at the same time fearfully sad. The focus character is an artist who has come to Hollywood to escape the art-school banality of painting red barns and lily-pads. Now he's working on a single apocalyptic painting -- \\"Hollywood in Flames\\" -- depicting the desperate anomie of \\"those who have come to California to die.\\" In the foreground of his painting will be all the bizarre hapless cast of people in his own grungy screenplay life. The painting is the novella, and the novella is the painting, a point that many readers seem to have missed. It's a quick read, friends, and a tightly assembled script, and I don't really want to mute the excitement of reading it by blabbing too much of the action.As a depiction of Southern California as it was in the 1930s, it's worth a thousand books of sociology, rich with sketches of \\"...the cultists of all sorts, economic as well as religious, the wave, airplane, funeral and preview watchers - all those poor devils who can only be stirred by the promise of miracles and then only to violence... marching behind his banner in a great unified front of screwballs and screwboxes to purify the land.\\" Not even Raymond Chandler ever captured the tawdry menace and lurid intoxication of Los Angeles as well as West. Hollywood was truly the Potemkin Village of desires, where everyone was his own leading lady and the next person's 'extra'.And it's bigger and better-dressed today - Los Angeles, I mean - with the Getty Museum and the Disney Center for the Arts, but anyone who has lived or worked there will know that 'The Day of the Locust' is still a true picture of its permanent impermanence and impending transience."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Nathanael West hits it right on the head. The subject matter of his most famous novel is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that it was written in the 1930's. What we take for granted as the sordid and seedy stories of Hollywood today are actually nothing new, but it takes a shrewd observer like West to show us how even the periphery of the glamour capitol can go down in flames. Perhaps the greatest single symbol is the hero's painting, titled &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles&quot;. Think about that when you conjur images of Watts, Rodney King, Mark Fuhrman, and O.J. Simpson. I picked up this book when I saw it listed on the controversial &quot;100 Greatest English-Language Novels of the 20th Century&quot;. Until then, I knew it only by reputation but it was well worth investigating. Nathanael West is the real godfather of Hollywood. A shame he is not around to comment on it today."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Although this book left me quite depressed after my first read through, it still is one of the best books I ever read.

In this novella, West uses metaphor after metaphor to show how perverse the society of Los Angeles has become. Love has become nothing more than &quot;a vending machine,&quot; and he describes how the statue of Eros, the God of Love, was hidden in a trash can, covered by yesterday's newspaper. The ultimate question he leaves the reader with is what, if anything, can be done to save this ruined society based on unfulfilled dreams"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"I bought this to teach to high school seniors instead of the New Directions edition, which also contains Miss Lonelyhearts.

Seeing how the New Directions edition is cheaper,and contains Lonelyhearts I see no reason to buy this. This company should do better work before issuing great books like this."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Nathanael West's \\"The Day of the Locust\\" was an inspirational book. It is based in the 1930s and centers around Tod Hackett, a man that had just moved from Yale to Hollywood to take a job as a designer. This book is thoroughly enjoyable to read. It explores themes such as materialism and obsession, making it easy to relate to and therefore much more fun to read. Nathanael West develops a handful of stereotypical characters with flat, yet flamboyant personalities. Tod Hackett is really the only character that develops throughout the book, though not necessarily for the better. However, even with stereotypical, flat characters, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" never gets boring.Tod Hackett moves to Hollywood and is immediately disgusted by the type of people there. However, the longer he stayed in Hollywood, the more he conformed to them. He is swept up by Faye Greener, an aspiring actor. He develops a deep obsession for her, one that she does not share. However, Faye is an actor through and through and never has true, genuine feelings. At first, Tod does not realize this whatsoever and continues to try to get with her. Nothing he does ever works, though. He does not understand why until, after living in Hollywood for a while and beginning to understand the type of people that live there, he sees that Faye is just acting when she seems to flirt with him. This leads to Tod's first breakdown and, in a way, is the beginning of the end.\\"The Day of the Locust\\" comes to a dramatic, fantastic ending when the one thing that Tod Hackett hated more than anything else about the people of Hollywood overtakes him: materialism. From the minute he moved to Hollywood he could not understand why the people there were so materialistic. Yet, over time, he develops into the same type of person. Nathanael West did an amazing job in developing Tod Hackett as a person and showing just how much one's environment can change and corrupt someone and how much obsession can effect one's life."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"DO NOT buy this copy of The Day of the Locust. I was shocked at the poor quality, as though it had been translated from another language. It is riddled with typos, and sometimes they even misspell the main character's names. The formatting is awful and the type is very very small. The book is also strangely large for a novel; this is not a professional print job. I can't believe I even paid money for this print, it managed to make reading un-enjoyable. Amazon, don't you do quality control? Jeez...."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Some of the depravities of Hollywood and LA depicted here seem slightly quaint today (now that the area has had sixty years to surpass West's vision), but this book still hits the mark with a remarkable frequency. When West is writing at his best he functions as a baleful documentor of what would grow into the LA we all know and love. Cults, pseudoreligions, celebrity-worship, crowds, riots, child actors, hodgepodge architecture, and an industry dedicated to the falsification of reality: all of them are here, and West's writing on these afflictions still retains force today. Ultimately, West sees LA as an environment in which no human goodness can survive-a kind of moral black hole-and this is certainly reflected in the novel's array of characters, who are largely a batch of self-centered xenophobes. Even Tod, ostensibly the novel's \\"hero,\\" tries (more than once) to summon up the courage to simply rape Faye. In other words, this book won't be a big hit with people who use \\"I didn't like any of the characters\\" as a criticism: a shame, because there's a reasonably good study of human desperation to be found here, and West's focus on how certain environments and cultures exacerbate that desperation is still profoundly relevant to our own day. A quick read, not very difficult, dense, or lyrical, but a fine addition to the \\"literature\\" on LA."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"West's dark novel of L.A.s fringe culture in the 1930s still packs a punch. Rarely has the seamier and more eccentric side of southern California culture (which I know well since I grew up there) been captured so starkly and been described with such a pitiless eye. It's a little bit like Todd Brown's cult movie, Freaks, in its focus on the lives of the unwanted and neglected rejects of American society. Only in this case, instead of the carnies Brown portrays, they are the Hollywood hopefuls who just barely eke out an existence against the highly polished backdrop of Hollywood's glitter and glamour. But the polish is shown to be a superficial and thin veneer below which lies the real Hollywood, a false but gritty world of forlorn hopes and broken dreams. Overall still a great novel and one that still packs a considerable wollop in its unvarnished and gritty portrayal of the seamy side of L.A. life in the 1930s."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Published in the late 30's, Nathanael West's \\"The Day of the Locust\\" reads like the proof of the betrayal of the American Dream. Both spiritually and materially, this betrayal was what most people had in mind by that time, when they were living the Great Depression. This feeling is so close to this writer prose and literary project that poet W.H. Auden coined the term \\"West's disease\\" to refer to poverty that exists in both a spiritual and economic sense.\\"The Day of the Locust\\" is one of the best novels about the early years Hollywood, when everyone thought it was easy to be a star -- not that nowadays this has changed, but today's starlets don't have the ingenuity that people had by that time. The narrative follows the lives of a couple of characters that are associated to the movie industry.When it was published, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" was little noticed and was considered of \`bad taste' by many critics. West's masterpiece's acclamation came with time, when reader's minds are opener to such a dark and pessimistic tale. Probably, by the time it was published, readers were so immersed in the issues that West brings up in his prose that it was difficult for them to apart from the problems.The narrative floats between two poles. At one side, we have very realistic features -- at the other, the movie industry looks surreal and even dreamy, what makes it very artificial, as a matter of fact. The main character is Tod Hackett, who has recently graduated from Yale University, and works as an illustrator and set designer for a movie company. He lives in the same building of Faye Greener, an aspiring and ambitious actress who doesn't date him, because he is neither handsome, nor rich.Through Heckett-Greener relationship, West will introduce in this book a handful of characters that are somehow linked to the movie industry and the flaw in the American Dream. One of them is Homer Simpson (no relation to the cartoon character), a kind of catatonic man who moved to Hollywood following his doctor's advice after a bout of pneumonia. He doesn't work and lives on the money he has saved. Trying to forget an uncomfortable memory he has of his love experience, he starts meeting Faye. And Tod becomes his friend of out curiosity.The set of characters of \\"The Day of the Locust\\" borderlines the surreal and even, the grotesque. Faye's father for instance is a man who lives in the shadow of his previous years of relative fame when he used to perform vaudeville clown. Now he his job is to sell homemade silver polish door-to-door. However, he still tries to get back to acting and find again the fame he thinks he once had.By using such device, West paints a cruel and realistic portray of the early Hollywood. A bittersweet evocation of a civilization that is cruel and tender to its own citizens. Something that was cool five minutes ago can be outdated now. Actors and other professionals are not people any more -- just tools to make money. Fame is something very relative. In the end, West says that those people will destroy and eat themselves -- just like a mythological monster, making of \\"The Day of the Locust\\" an unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Interestingly, without any intention, I read this novel immediately after finishing Joan Didion's \\"Play It As It Lays.\\" Each is a burning indictment of Hollywood - this novel was written in 1939 and \\"Play\\" was written in 1970.Like Pynchon's \\"Crying of Lot 49\\", the style of this novel is quirky and many of the moments are meant to shock the reader. Some shocks (remember this is a 1939 novel) include a screening of a french pornographic film at one person's house of prostitution, a detailed description of a cock fight at Homer Simpson's (yes that is the character's name) garage, a beautiful actress's (Faye Greener) decision to pay for her father's funeral by employing herself with a silent screen actor's cat house, an incredible depiction of running through a studio's lot where one backdrop falls into another - distanced by centuries and continents from the prior, and an angry dwarf's (Abe Kusich) confrontation with about anyone he meets.The ending reads heavily. Is it metaphor? Is it purely emblematic? In any event, it is riotous, where the dying mental characters of the novel congregate like frantic sheep and hurt one another in a crowded attempt to \\"get one glance\\" at a movie star at the famous movie house where many films are opened - Kahn's Persian Palace Theatre.The book scoffs Hollywood's allure and sensual delight envisioned by the midwesterners (Homer is from Des Moines, Iowa) and others.\\"Once there, they discover that sunshine isn't enough. They get tired of oranges, even of avocado pears and passion fruit. Nothing happens. They don't know what to do with their time. They haven't the mental equipment for leisure, the money nor the physical equipment for pleasure. . . They watch the waves come in at Venice. There wasn't any ocean where most of them come from, but after you've seen one wave, you've seen them all.\\"The protagonist, Tod Hackett, cannot escape the ennui - the malaise - with which he lives. Like Walter Percy's \\"The Moviegoer\\", the character's life remains in a funk. Unlike Percy's character, Hackett does not escape the ennui, and becomes one of \\"them.\\" Those whose \\". . . boredom becomes more and more terrible. . . They have been cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing.\\" Life (for all of the characters in this book) is miserable under the golden sun of Hollywood.This is depressing - but not like Didion's \\"Play.\\" West does not reach into the mind of the protagonist. Instead, West shows us how unique and simultaneously droll Tod's life can be. One can only wonder if this novel is autobiographical."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Perhaps the best novel ever written about Hollywood, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; presents a grotesque world in which pretense and reality have become so intertwined that it is impossible to distinguish between them any longer. Shot through with mordant humor (especially a sequence which describes a California funeral home in terms which anticipate Waugh's &quot;The Loved One&quot;), the novel deals with people who are chasing some illusory dream which they cannot even clearly articulate, let alone obtain. West paints a bleak view of humanity's chances, but he does so with such insight and well-honed satire (not to mention his wonderfully sparse prose, in which every word has been carefully chosen for effect) that the book is never less than compelling."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"This book is as relevent today as it was in the thirties...maybe even more so. Why do people flock to California, \\"the land of sunshine and oranges? Once there they discover that sunshine isn't enough. They get tired of the oranges, even of avocado pears and passion fruit. Nothing happens. They don't know what to do with their time. They haven't the mental equipment for pleasure...their boredom becomes more and more terrible. They realize they've been tricked and burn with resentment...the sun is a joke. Oranges can't titillate their jaded pallets. Nothing can ever be violent enough to make taut their slack minds and bodies. They have been cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing.\\" Brilliant stuff that captures the discontent of newcomers to Califonia and specifically jollywood. The joke that Californians are flakes and freaks is reflected not in the natives but those from elsewhere seeking more and more sensual satisfaction. A timeless book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Extraordinary!This is not caricature. This was the \\"feel\\" of society--as felt by Nathanael West--in the Hollywood of the 1930s.More frighteningly, this was, I believe, West's forecast for the \\"feel\\" of future American society.How correct his vision!"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Written in the 1930s in the midst of the Depression, \\"Day of the Locust\\" portrays the Hollywood glamour scene from the perspective of the oft forgotten supporting characters. This is, those who came to California with high dreams and have become bitter with resentment and disappointment. The novel is told from the perspective of a recent Yale grad, Tod, who is an aspiring artist who takes a job at a movie studio to pay his bills. Throughout the novel, West masterfully portrays a set of characters, whose twisted dreams and aspirations are intertwined into a delicate web of failure.Although Tod's psyche may be absent of unrealistic dreams of stardom and he is moderately successful, he lets his infatuation overcome him when he meets a talentless wannabe, Faye Greener. Although she may be living a pipe dream (and sings about getting high, for that matter), her vitality and energy enraptures not just Tod, but a whole set of diverse characters, from a dust-bitten cowboy to a painfully shy Midwesterner. Indeed, her mere presence can begin an undercurrent of sexual tension that manifests itself in a violent fury.Throughout the novel, Tod uses his imagination to picture the setting for his masterpiece painting, the \\"Burning of Los Angeles\\". In his months in Los Angeles, he becomes an acute observer of people, often singling out those who have \\"come to California to die\\". This includes not only the wannabe starlets, like Faye, but common laborers from the Midwest and South who came to capture the California dream but have had their dreams relegated to the dustbin.Overall, West succeeds in showing how the \\"other half\\" lived during the heyday of Hollywood, as nary a movie star enters the narrative. This is less a novel about Hollywood and more a novel about unrealistic dreams and their potentially sinister implications if left unfulfilled. Although written more almost seventy years ago, it is still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"West makes a successful attempt to show the reality of Hollywood instead of the sugarcoated glamour usually permeated by the media. But is it the reality? Or is it just the perspective of a disillusioned writer? We will never know for sure, but us humans tend to take tragedy as more tangible than fantasy so it sure seems real. What makes this dark uncensored view even more shocking is the fact that it was written in the 1930s, when Hollywood glitz was supposed to be in its heyday. People were still jaded back then as they are now. West has a knack for character psychology, especially when showing how pathetic and desperate humans can be. I recommend Day of the Locusts mainly for that reason; you will find characters who want someone who wants someone else, the desperate young aspiring actress who is not yet corrupted but very soon will be, the stoic midwestern man who is out of his depths in the lies and games of Hollywood folk, the ordinary people around Hollywood just waiting for their chance with a rabid intensity, and the artist-narrator's who invisions all the madness around him as an apocalypse that will end in the \\"Burning of Los Angeles\\". I promise some characters in this book will make an indelible impression on you."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"This kindle edition of THE DAY OF THE LOCUST has a lot of typos. The first chapter alone has three, including \\"truculent\\" spelled as \\"truculentas\\" (Is it being typed in a Tiajuana chop shop?). Annoying. I will read on a bit, but if I find many more, I will be returning the book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Due to the mediocrity of this novel on all levels, including not having a strong plot, not developing an original theme, and not including elements to make it a novel to surpass all other novels that deal with a similar time period, Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust is not worth its time reading.First of all, this novel has no strong, or even apparent plot. Without a plot, there is no backbone to support any ideas, if West were to introduce any. He does introduce an initial issue where the idealistic character Faye strives to make it big in Hollywood, a typical American Dream of the 1920's: \\"I'm going to be a star one day ... it's the only thing in the whole world that I want.\\" However, this statement is as far as the plot deepens; the rest of the 100 pages of the novel is filled with irrelevant instances that do not serve to continue the plot or even the resolve the issue.Secondly, West does not develop his original theme, which has the potential to be of outstanding interest to the audience. In the first couple of pages of the novel, he introduces his major theme as, \\"It is hard to laugh at the need for beauty and romance, no matter how tasteless, even horrible, the results of that need are. But it is easy to sigh. Few things are sadder than the truly monstrous.\\" He introduces this idea of an ugly side to humanity, however, he never evolves the theme into something more. Without the development of a major idea, this novel continues in its mediocrity.Lastly, there are no existent elements in the novel to make it a classic worth reading. There is no real literary value, since it does nothing to stir feelings within the audience. In addition, there are other outstanding novels that deal with this same time period, such as The Great Gatsby, that are incredibly hard to outshine if mediocrity is the highest level this novel is able to reach.Due to all of these reasons, The Day of the Locust has no real substance to prove that it is worth its time to read. It meets the standards of mediocrity, but only goes as far as just that."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"This book is often called the best book ever written about Hollywood.

Don't waste your time reading it. Just listen to the song, \\"Maneater\\", by Nelly Furtado and you will have the gist of the story!!"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Nathanael West created a haunting, eminently readable novel in 1939. The real twist is that the tale resonates today. West's keen and prescient evaluation of the dark side of L.A. stands up to contemporary times. It is a city that is complex: extremes of wealth and poverty, a city of dreams and nightmares, a place of competition and sublimation, where almost every facet of the city is touched by the \\"industry\\" of film with its vapor trail of glamour and beauty.The protagonist, Tod Hackett, is a frustrated commercial artist working for the movie studios, a \\"sellout\\" according to his art school compatriots back on the East Coast. The narrator's voice never fails to reflect the immediate events around him with fluidity and insight, key to the book's readability. Tod's philosophical examination and keen insight into his adopted City of Angels encompasses the city's unique role as a destination of dreamers that can deteriorate into a nightmare as the distinctions become clear between those that \\"made it,\\" those that think they're going to make it, and those that know they aren't. Tod's experiences with various characters in Hollywood could itself make a movie (and, indeed, has): the capricious survivor Faye Greener and her worn-out father Harry; contentious dwarf Abe Kusich, drugstore cowboy Earle Shoop, and perhaps the most complex and troubled character, Homer Simpson, a Midwest emigrant to the \\"promised land\\" who also is briefly a narrator. Throughout various scenarios ranging from religious revivals, movie openings, the business of a bordello, and the everyday ephemera known as life, West creates a memorable portrait of a man who is seeking something that perhaps can never be found. Tod is overwhelmed with nihilism but seeks to temper it with a dual objectification and repulsion towards Faye Greener.Perhaps what West creates most movingly is a portrait of L.A.- the excitement, the grunge, the messiness, the beauty of it all juxtaposed with the fairy tale meeting cold reality. With so few \\"making it\\" L.A. is a city filled with those who believe they are one step away from success, or have more chillingly, resigned themselves to feeding off the city and its inhabitants through various means. You have to be hungry, smart, and relentless to make it in L.A. Behind the sunshine and palm trees lies a spirit of fierce competition and brutal one-upmanship.I would strongly recommend this book for its straightforward yet beautifully insightful prose, and the unforgettable characterization of Tod Hackett, perhaps one of my favorite male narratorsoutside of Holden Caulfield. Entertaining, witty, and realistic, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" doesn't have a Hollywood ending. But would we want it to?"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Holloywoodized America is held to the flame until the whole of the marshmallow has bubbled and dripped into the fire.

Excellent read, would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"West's &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; is my favorite novel from the early 20th century &quot;modernist&quot; era. While largely tragic, this novel seems to have predicted where our society was heading with much success. West's descriptions of everyday life in early Hollywood may provide insight on why life today can seem empty and withdrawn. Los Angeles becomes a city where a way of life is conceived that eventually defines American culture. While its ending is nearly apocalyptic, West describes an alternative to the emptiness of the impending modern age. The &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; is so powerful it has affected the work of the present-day pop artisans Matt Groening and the Cohen brothers. Nathaniel West's life in Los Angeles was the model used for Barton Fink's cinematic travails. The DOTL's protagonist is named Homer Simpson. This is a beautiful piece of work"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"In this wonderfully crafted mini-novel, Nathanael West captures the cultural essence of boomtown Los Angeles during its tumultuous adolescence. The dark, coarse, seamy side of the &quot;California dream&quot; is vividly portrayed here. The plot is not really the point in this period piece; the truth is in the characters and their always unfortunate interactions. For those who seek to understand the social history of southern California, this novel might be more useful than a half-dozen academic treatises."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Life is the struggle of the fittest. The strongest, both mentally and physically, have a better chance of winning in the competition for survival. In The Day of the Locust by Nathaniel West, a cockfight represents natural selection. A scene from the cockfight is \\"Juju rose but missed. The red thrust weakly with its broken bill. Juju went into the air again and this time drove a gaff through one of the red's eyes into its brain. The red fell over stone cold dead.\\" The many gory scenes of violence between two individuals in the fight for the American dream of wealth and fame leave no space for hope.The prominent theme of the novel is inevitable failure. Many who enter Hollywood are not strong enough to survive the artificiality and surreal atmospheres associated with aspiring actors and actresses. The weaklings in the fight for fame become insane and frail. For example, Mr. Greener, an unsuccessful comedic actor, \\"clowned continuously. It was the sole method of defense. Most people, he had discovered, won't go out of their way to punish a clown.\\" Mr. Greener's dreams were torn apart by the mobs of people who always criticized and patronized struggling actors and actresses. The inevitable destruction ensued by the mobs focuses only on the negative aspects of life in Hollywood. The constant allusion to suffering makes the overall setting of the novel not as interesting to read and not as realistic, because a person's fate can end with the accomplishment of certain dreams."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"This is *the* novel about Hollywood and its place in American culture. All other attempts are imitations. Period."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"The Day of the Locust takes place in Hollywood in 1939, at the end of the depression and the brink of World War II. The book is a character study of the interactions of various hanger-ons at the edges of the motion picture industry. The book is written in a tone of absolute dispair, and it tries to point out how pointless dreams and wishes are. There is no joy to be found in sunshine, oranges, the ocean, life... My optimistic soul wanted to rage against the author and the characters. I guess I can understand how a Jewish man would feel a sense of pessimism in 1939, but I can't recommend the book as anything but an example of the wrong way to see the world."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"&quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is about the strange, disparate people that invariably get drawn to Los Angeles in the 1930's, a time when studios put out assembly-line low-budget movies and employed revolving crews of extras, writers, and various technicians. The novel seems influenced by Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; in its portrayal of &quot;grotesques,&quot; emotionally or behaviorally defective people on the fringe of society, but its tone is much more vibrant and frenetic; if &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is a petting zoo, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is a three-ring circus.At the center of the action is an artist and scene designer named Tod Hackett. He observes southern California with a sort of concerned detachment; he sees it as a wasteland of incongruous, tacky architecture and rootless people who come here to die. His discontent is manifested in his extracurricular plan to paint a canvas called &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles.&quot;Even though Tod may be considered the main character, he's the least interesting member of the cast; he's like the &quot;straight man&quot; in a comedy team. He's in love with an aspiring actress and occasional prostitute named Faye Greener who likes to use men. She has managed to hook a shy, lonely unemployed hotel bookkeeper named Homer Simpson (!) who moved to L.A. from Iowa for his health. Homer has compulsively fidgety hands and occasionally even exhibits the simplemindedness of his bald, mustard-colored cartoon namesake. Faye is also attracted to a lanky cowboy named Earle Shoop who works in a Sunset Boulevard saddlery store, does occasional movie work, and doesn't seem to know he's a caricature.There is a cavalcade of other colorful characters, including Faye's father Harry, an ex-vaudeville clown who is now peddling silver polish door-to-door; Abe Kusich, a drunken dwarf; Claude Estee, a successful screenwriter who has a rubber sculpture of dead horse in his swimming pool; Joan Schwartzen, a loud, lewd harridan, who is probably Phyllis Diller's progenitor; Miguel, Earle's chicken-tending Mexican friend; and last but not least, Adore Loomis, an obnoxious aspiring kid star.The novel focuses on the lives of these fringe characters rather than moviemaking, which allows West to demonstrate that he excels at writing unusual, difficult scenes -- a screening of a porn flick, a cockfight, a riot at a movie premiere. The inventiveness, energy, and attitude here cannot be overstated; never have I read a novel that delights so much in pathetic human oddity, in mixing its characters into a violent Molotov cocktail and observing the comical results with jubilation."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"I've read all of West's other novels - The Dream Life of Balso Snell, A Cool Million, Miss Lonelyhearts - and all three seemed to miss something that is hard for me to explain. A little two-dimensional, a little hollow. Neither the characters nor the novels themselves seemed to be totally fleshed out. But The Day of the Locust is different. And ultimately I think it is on this novel that West's reputation will either rise or fall.This book will really live with you long after you've read it. I can easily bring to mind that spectacular cockfight (a fine bit of descriptive writing), Faye's teasing, Harry Greener, the midget, the scene in the nightclub when the cross-dresser sings, and that final horrific scene when the riot breaks out in LA. You can skip West's other novels and you won't be very deprived, but The Day of the Locust is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Locust does a great job of showing the ugly side of the shiny veneer of Hollywood. The book deals with lust, desire, hope, disappointment, failure, rage, and death. To avoid being misleading, I should say that the movie business is not the front and center story here. The interpersonal relationships between a woman and her father and her suitors is the main plotline. Hollywood acts as a backdrop.Faye is a failed actress who only gets work as an extra, and Homer and Todd are just two of the men who are drunk with desire for her.This alternates with The Sound and the Fury for my favorite book. I've read it 3 times, which is as much as I've read any book....Locust is a quick read and never boring. Check out the movie too."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"The fact that The Day of the Locust was published in 1939, would, I thought, make it a bit too dated or old-fashioned to enjoy. Happily, I was wrong. Nathanael West's novel is like a well-oiled and maintained Disney ride, guaranteed to educate, amuse and thrill. We climb in the car and enter a tunnel into a world that is, of course, gone forever. Truly an insider's novel, the parasitic Todd lives in the bowels of the many-headed Hollywood beast, but he is not \\"of it.\\" He comes to Hollywood to work as a studio artist and is too smart to be trapped by all the fascinating things he sees, especially the beautiful Faye. This sets him apart from the drifters, dreamers and pensioners who have been drawn by the allure and glitter. On a smaller scale, Faye IS Hollywood, drawing men close to eventually destroy them much like the lizard hiding in the plant in Homer's house patiently waiting for the next foolish fly to light on the plant's flowers. The only thing in the novel that disappointed me, and only a little, was the dearth of information about Homer Simpson (not that one). I wanted to know more about this polite, quiet and stoic Midwesterner. We know he came west for his health, but why does he invite Faye to live with him? Why does he put up with the abuse? Then I remembered that West was writing before the age of Freud, before the good doctor's psychoanalysis became the normative tool; people were the way they were ... just because. It was \`in the blood', or they \`took after the father', whatever. Pre-Freud writers gave their characters no breaks for having had a mamma that didn't love them, except perhaps, just a passing mention of the fact.The secondary characters are fascinating in their brazenness and crudeness; you can almost smell them. They are the kind of folk modern middle class readers don't usually come into contact with, like Earl, for instance, the close-mouthed drugstore cowboy, and Miguel the Mexican with his fighting cocks, which are a metaphor for the men who employ them. The violence between Abe, Earl and Miguel struck me as comic, like the sight of two dogs mating on a Sunday sidewalk in front of a busy church. Perhaps it was because, again, we moderns don't see too many middle class men having fistfights, except in videos.Young women, uninterested in marriage, sleeping around as they seek to advance their careers, superficiality, frenzied celebrity-worshipping mobs, plain-looking grown men who stupidly lust after beautiful women who are completely uninterested in them, unbridled egotism, desires, dreams, and very little thinking and planning -- the essence of what West worked with here seems to have long ago been mainstreamed down into the great American masses - think of MTV, MySpace, Christina and Britney videos, Survivor and American Idol. But no one, to my knowledge, has illustrated it as vividly and delightfully as West has.The ending, like the endings of all good novels, drifts slowly away from you, like the beautiful young woman you just held in your arms, fading back into a crowded dance floor. At about 200 pages, a paperback of The Day of the Locust is a must-have addition to your backpack or briefcase, or, perhaps, as an ebook, downloaded into your laptop or cell phone.The sad fact that this brilliant novel and West's earlier works brought him no significant money or recognition gives this writer succor."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"....To read Nathaniel West's description, it would seem so.Every character in this novel of 1930s Hollywood is a greedy scoundrel. Every character is out for him/herself. Everyone's a sinner, and it's absolutely delicious.I love novels with very eccentric, flamboyant characters. The kind of characters who perform on a dime. Faye, the main female character shakes, dances, gyrates, sings....for any audience, no audience etc..Storywise, you never know what's real and what's make-believe....which is a metaphor for Hollywood itself.The plot is Tod Hackett, an illustrator from the Mid-West coming out to Hollywood to work in pictures. The characters he meets, and the variety of personality traits, ticks, neurosis, dysfunctions are astounding. This is a novel of fringe, downscale, periphery Hollywood. The losers behind the scenes. Well, here's to the losers, because they move the plot and this has to be one of the most page-turning classic novels I've ever read.All throughout the novel you get the sense something big is going to go down.....and the characters' own extreme traits drive this. I love it when a writer gets mileage, not from actual plot turns and twists, but solely from personality traits. The story feels like it's just moving along on it's own, as opposed to being heavily contrived.I thought this novel was extremely interesting, thought-provoking, and suspenseful, as you never really know if the characters and scenes are play-acted, or for real. The reader is really left guessing. Is a fight, a real fight, when the participants just laugh the whole thing off at the end? Do these fringe characters really have all these personality ticks? Or, are these just affectations, at the ready for their next audition? Is there a real apocalypse coming, or is it simply simulated apocalypse, just like everything else along the Hollywood landscape?You never really know, which is what makes this novel so deep and thought provoking. It can be anything the reader wants it to be. The hallmark of great storytelling/writing is the many interpretations a reader can bring to it.Either these strange characters are the most creative, inventive people on earth.......or they are the most pathetic, depending on if you really believe (make-believe?) half of what they get themselves involved in.Some of the most memorable personalities in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Now I know why Flannery O'Connor so admired West. His prose is crystal clear, his craft virtuoso. His characters, however ugly, are utterly compelling and tragic. There was simply no stopping them. They would hang on to their delusions even if it destroys them. And then there are the people with no hope whatsoever, existing just for surface pleasure and materialism. Tod, the 'artist', tries to help these people, and nearly goes mad with frustration. West's compassion for these people (cloaked by his biting sarcasm and wit) makes this book a great work of art. It, like O'Connor's &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; are among the masterpieces of American fiction.

The two protagonists, Tod Hacket and Homer Simpson, provide alternating perspectives on the Los Angeles Freak Show, with Tod as a sardonic observer who feels at home and Homer Simpson as the Mid-Westerner whose ultimately destroyed by Los Angeles.Rabelis-like hilarity and 20th century cynicism meet for a funny, disturbing book that's required reading for anyone that wants to mock L.A."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"I lived in Southern California during most of the 1980s (San Diego), and after reading this book, I was amazed at how little had changed since 1939, the year this book was published. West draws perfectly the despair and rootless emptiness underlying the pretty smiles, watered landscapes, imported plants and wonderful lifestyles. Reading this book reminded me of how I found the sight of a palm tree disturbing for years after I moved away.West also insightfully points out that the absurd culture has been produced by the transients, not the long time natives. I remember putting down Southern California in front of a native one time - she became upset and said \\"You people made it like this.\\""},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Nathaniel West's sardonic and dark novel of Hollywood ousiders is as warm and friendly as a dead codfish. A group of oddballs, all living in Hollywood all seem to be slipping towards destruction in this classic of the genre. A studio artist, an aspiring actress and old vaudevillian and others collide with each other in a quest for something intangible, and make glancing blows of emotion during their journey. It's interesting to me that West's novel, though full of tragedy in some sense, is not without humor, and the characters, though gritty, are slightly unreal. It feels to me almost like West has created a sick cartoon of a novel, which is absorbing and full of interesting visual touches, but never quite meant to be taken seriously. It is, however, riveting!"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"If there is one test that tries all equally, it is the test of time. What is merely a statement of a fad, or a passing whim, quickly fades away. What lasts, thick and thin, good times and bad, passing through fashion and invention and change, proves itself worthy. So has Nathanael West's short novel, \\"The Day of the Locust,\\" passed its test of time. Written in and about the 1930s, it is a portrait of the most superficial of places: Hollywood. And, aside from progress in computerized special effects and the ever quickening turnaround of superstar marriages and divorces, what has changed about this town and its culture? Ah, nothing. The superficial reigns.West calls to stage a most colorful array of, some might say, \\"freaks.\\" But perhaps that is too harsh. These are misfits and fantasizers and wildly hopefuls. There is the actress part-timing as a prostitute, the cowboy without a ranch, the drunken dwarf, the lonely and geekish hotel bookkeeper in stupid devotion to the actress who never quite knows what to do with his immense hands, the screenwriter with a rubber horse in his swimming pool, the obnoxious and precocious child star, and a string of other unusuals that, in Hollywood, are all too usual. Their backdrops and scenarios are no less so: cockfights and porn flick screenings, questionable deaths, business schemes based on anatomy overthinking brain. It's all here. And West handles it all like a fine juggling act, never dropping the ball.His grand finale is indeed grand. It is what brings to mind the locust. This seething insect that acts en masse and without thinking, following just to follow, stampeding and destroying all in its ravenous path, yet not without eruptions of the grotesque.Perhaps what makes this all so moving is that Hollywood brings to spotlight what, after all, exists everywhere. Only here it is the stuff of which movies are made. Or, in this case, a masterly piece of fine literature."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"I am so glad this book has been published with a pretty cover. That old black and white one was so creepy I'm sure a lot of people passed it by owing to the judge-a-book-by-its-cover syndrone. &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is the best reflection of LA noir that I have read. It is just wonderful and the characters are pretty tragic. When we had the riots and I saw the city burning I could not help but think of this book and its haunting prophecy. If you're hemming and hawing about what to read on your summer vacation snap this one up right away, but don't expect sunshine and roses. Well, actually there is sunshine seeing as how it's in Los Angeles. I'm sorry N. West had to die so soon. He was a #$%^ good writer."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"&quot;Nothing short of violent rape would do&quot; is Tod's line when he becomes frustrated with a whore's refusal to sleep with him. Violence is what this novel is abount. West is trying to warn us all about a society that is becoming so violent that the only entertainment is watching planes crash in a blazing heap from the sky. He dosen't take full of his oppurtunity, in my opinion this novel falls just a little bit short. West is a good writer but not a great writer."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"The story was going so well. Characters were interesting and the sense of closure was near. Then ???

I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this. Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts. The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today. Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Short and easy to read novel depicting the fringes of society. The characters are all misfits and hanger-on's seeking miraculous cures from their failings by basking in the sunshine and glitz of Hollywood.The most beleivable character is an untalented actress and part time prostitute who drives men insane.The story seemed a bit unreal to me but then so is Hollywood."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"The Day of the Locust was required reading for me so that may be one of the reasons that I did read it. I did however find it easy to read and almost enjoyable. The story flows nicely, but the end of the book left me asking, &quot;Why did I just waste my time reading that?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Nathanael West's novella The Day of the Locust is a work with an essential flaw. The book is not badly written, nor does it lack plot or characterization; Locust is passable in all these respects. Rather, the problem with The Day of the Locust is that it does not exceed expectations in these areas. Instead of becoming a standout work, The Day of the Locust remains merely mediocre.To most readers of American literature, the theme of The Day of the Locust is a familiar one: the collapse of the fabled \\"American dream.\\" In Locust, this dream is represented by the promise of fame and fortune in 1930's Hollywood. The Day of the Locust traces its characters' pursuit of this goal toward their ultimate destruction.Unfortunately, this motif has already been explored in such notable works as, for example, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Gatsby is often considered to be one of the greatest American novels of all time; therefore, West faces very high standards with The Day of the Locust, and his work is not strong enough to meet them. For instance, in Locust, one character reflects, \\"It is hard to laugh at the need for beauty and romance, no matter how tasteless, how horrible, the results of that need are.\\" This idea is one that has already been successfully expressed in Gatsby and elsewhere. West's words add no insight that cannot be found in other novels on the same theme as Locust.Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust needs to reach new and dazzling literary heights to make itself stand out from novels similar to it. Unfortunately, Locust manages no such accomplishments, establishing itself only as an average work on a theme better covered by others."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"I read this book for a class in LA History, which I find fascinating, alluring and mysterious. I did not enjoy the read as I found West's style difficult to follow. I knew the premise ofthe book and found it to be a critique and indictment of society in general which happened, in this book, to be located in the movie industry in Los Angeles. I think West's point, of many, about the dreams of \\"locusts\\" not being met and the degradation of society, could be aplicable in many different industries in many different cities in America. So, while it is an indictment of Hollywood and what it represents, and portrays the reality of Los Angeles contrasted to its myth, it could be anywhere. What I find is that it is one of those books that stays with you and is great to discuss and think about when you have finished it."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"No matter how good this book is, how can you take it seriously when one of its main characters is named &quot;Homer Simpson&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust","review":"Ah, a book with cockfights, a true cowboy in LA, and the original Homer Simpson. This book, while not overtly outrageous, it shows scenes of the eccentric life of a few fringe people in Hollywood.Throughout this book, unique characters are introduced and their lives are showed in the most interesting ways. From a lonely man who takes in a woman, to the woman who ruthlessly takes advantage of him, to the woman's father, who tirelessly wants to entertain. A mix of failures, this book portrays a truer Hollywood, where success and glamour are very limited, but where mental diversity is everywhere.While it does do a good job of showing people and situations, the sentence structure is not too fluid. Sometimes a paragraph or two may have to be re-read. Also, this book does not have much cohesiveness to it. With no plot, and no central theme, the book drifts from one scene to the next. Because of this, it's very hard to be captivated. By all means, this is not a page-turner.For those interested in books about people, I would recommend this book. For those looking for insight or story, I would suggest passing up this book."},{"Title":"Active Tectonics: Earthquakes, Uplift, and Landscape","review":"The book is a usefull tool for active tectonic studies.

The book had the appearance of an old history story that I may have passed up when I was twelve years old, but it would have been a great misfortune! I found myself being pulled through the pages and into the world of Lavinia Claudia. The Claudian family is forced to leave Rome during a time when Christianity is just starting to become well-known. Lavinia, having always been a pagan Roman is fearful of Christians, having been brought to believe that they would kidnap her and kill her.As Lavinia's family travels through Gaul to the White Isle in Britain they are met with many hardships along the way. Snedeker keeps you on the edge of your seat until finally Lavinia finds Christianity and peace.The White Isle is appropriately marked \`ages 12-adult' in my opinion, but not because of sensitive topics-it takes a more mature mind to appreciate the length that Snedeker goes to in order to provide amazing details. Did you know that a bride must sleep in her wedding attire the night before her wedding? How much do you know about the hierarchies of Rome? Did you ever consider that the people of Rome had to be careful in the wind to avoid losing their togas?I am barely scratching the surface. Read this out loud with your child, I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The White Isle","review":"I still remember this book even after 40 years. It is a great way to learn about the history of the Roman Empire and the beginnings of the Christian faith. The story is compelling and allows the reader to imagine life in the past. Some things, like wanting to belong, never change. This book started my interest in history. I would love to have the chance to read this again."},{"Title":"The White Isle","review":"It is during the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian (A. D. 117-138), and Lavinia Claudius is a thirteen-year-old girl who lives on the Palatine Hill in Rome with her father Publius Favonius, mother Aurelia, and older brother Marcus. The Claudius family is an old, noble, and formerly wealthy family which has fallen on hard times. Furthermore, Favonius is out of favor with the Emperor and has been appointed to an obscure military post in far-off Britain. Lavinia is betrothed to marry a rich neighbor named Decimus, and Aurelia hopes that Lavinia's remaining in Rome as Decimus's wife while the rest of the family travels to Britain will help to restore their lost fortunes. However, Lavinia overhears Decimus call her ugly, and the night before the wedding he disgraces his family by getting on a ship and running off to Iberia.The Claudius family is outraged, but Lavinia is secretly relieved and is glad to travel with the rest through Italia and Gaul, across the Fretum Gallicum (English Channel), to the White Isle of Britain, having many adventures along the way. The Claudians settle in Corinium where Lavinia is now betrothed to Carminius, a young man whose sisters have become friends with her. After Favonius goes off to his post and Marcus to join the army, Aurelia and Lavinia travel with their friend Marcia from back in Rome, whom they meet unexpectedly at the baths in Aqua Sulis, to visit her home in the distant city of Dumnores. On the way they are captured by a tribe of Britons known as Durotrigs but are rescued by a band of Christians led by a young man named Govan. All Lavinia has heard about Christians is that they offer human sacrifices and drink the blood of their children. Yet, Lavinia finds herself strangely drawn to Govan. Will Aurelia and Lavinia ever make it back home to see Favonius and Marcus? And will Lavinia marry Carminius or someone else?As she did in her other historical fiction novels of the classical realm, such as Theras and His Town, Lysis Goes to the Play, The Spartan, The Forgotten Daughter, and A Triumph for Flavius, author Caroline Dale Snedeker paints a wonderfully accurate picture of everyday life and times in second-century Rome and Britain that children can appreciate. Added to this is the benefit of seeing the contrast between the cultures of the pagan Roman aristocracy and the ancient British Christians. There are a few references to some myths and legends concerning early Christianity which cannot be substantiated by fact, such as that of Joseph of Arimathaea's bringing to Britain the silver chalice that Jesus used at the last supper, but, of course, this is also a very important part of the underlying foundation for the \\"Holy Grail\\" stories of Arthurian fame. All in all, The White Isle is a great book. We did it as a family read aloud, and everyone enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Haydn (Great composers series)","review":"Mozart had both Einstein and more importantly, Kochel, to enable readers and music lovers to encompass his universe. Haydn has been lumbered with that dreaded Hoboken schemata which failed to extinguish the Opus numbers, thus adding bedlam to the confusion (particularly in the piano sonatas). Happily, his bibliography is in a much better state; we are all indebted to H C Robbins Landon for his herculean labours in this domain. Even so his masterwork, the Chronicle, almost requires a new bookcase to be housed - and one must take out a mortgage to acquire the entire set.Rosemary Hughes' contribution to the Master Musicians Series is much more than a stopgap or epitome. It is poetic. While Hughes writes critically, she does so with great love. While she cannot help but compare Haydn with the young Salzburger at various instances, say, in her analysis of the Maria Theresia symphony (which falls short of greatness), she avoids the mortal sin of kneecapping Haydn as a lesser Mozart. Concisely, she covers off the major masterpieces. No composer underwent more of a metamorphosis than Haydn: the distance between the penniless musician on the streets of Vienna and the old man who was kept awake by ideas that he could no longer gestate as Napoleon's cannons thundered away is measurable in parsecs; Hughes' treatment of this journey is masterly. Perhaps more space could have been allocated to the middle string quartets (Opus 50 is scantily treated) but Hughes was not Robinson Crusoe in such matters in the Seventies. One could say the same about the early and middle masses.It's a lovable book on a lovable man."},{"Title":"Math Detectives: Finding Fun in Numbers","review":"I am a 6th grade teacher, as well as, an adjunct teacher at the university level in the area of mathematics.

You've got the expected ones such as the road warrior, mutants and neo-savages, but mixed in are some really exotic types, such as magicians who derive their power from nuclear energy, 'Junkers', the sucessors of the Mad Scientists, and the undead Harrowed from the original Deadlands are back as well. The system is essentially the same as the original game, so veterans of the first Deadlands will be able to jump right in. The system uses cards as well as dice, which might seem odd to newcomers, but which is quite easy to adapt to. The rulebook is well laid-out and helpful, so you won't spend too much time leafing through it to look up an obscure rule. A nice touch is the black humour and the spaghetti-western vocabulary used throughout, which sets the mood without being too obtrusive.My only real complaint is that to use the game properly, you need a pack of cards and the ability to shuffle them, which is a disadvantage for klutzes like me. Some way to subsitute dice rolls for the cards would have be nice.

And the fact that you do get it makes you ponder on each little saying even more, which if sufficiently chewed on, invariably leads to insights about your own psyche, soul, spiritual path as well as the consciousness of the planet as a whole.If Kim Michaels intuitions are accurate, Jesus has one razor sharp mind and uses it with stunning effect and humor to challenge our rigid human opinions about religion, science, life, doctrine, prophecy, evil, philosophy, etc. four of fives lines at a time.Although the range of subjects are broad, there is a definite theme connecting these entertaining aphorisms. Namely, that God and the &quot;Christ Consciousness&quot; dwells in us and we can become one with him in the here and now. That we should not put Jesus on a pedestal, but rather take him down from the cross of idolatry and become the Christ ourselves.This is beyond &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; this is more like &quot;what would Jesus be&quot; and how I can be that too.

I also grew up Christian so I am no stranger to the teachings of Jesus, either. I was excited to see these blend in a fun way. This is not a traditional Zen collection, but a cute assembly of things Jesus should have said.Personally, I was hoping for more of a chapter and verse style of selection. That way I could go into it deeper if I wanted to track down an inspiration. This was not the case, and I was often left wondering whether a selection was actually scriptural or just an inspiration.

Westlake, is well known for several major characters, most especially Parker. Alan Grofield is an associate of Parker and also got to be the main protagonist of four Stark novels. This is the 4th and final one.This particular novel is a fairly straight-forward caper story, (actually involving several capers) and I really enjoyed the character of Grofield. He is a thief but he thinks of that occupation merely as a way to gain working capital so that he can pursue his life passion of acting in live theater. But he is a \\"gentle\\" thief, shying away from violent situations and refusing to do jobs involving killing. The author does a nice job of developing him as well as his supporting cast and the caper plots are quite interesting. I definitely need to go back and read the first three Grofield novels as well as take a deep dive into the Parker realm. The more Westlake I read, the more I want to read"},{"Title":"The raft","review":"These three men held on to a hopeless cause and came out victorious. They were without food and water for much of the 34 days they were afloat. The answer to how they did it is probably at the heart of man's will to survive and stay alive. This book is easy to read and the kind of story that motivates one to do the best he can and never give up. It also makes one appreciate what he has a little more. We see that everything can be lost very quickly, as in the case of the downed plane in this book, and that we have to have the mental willpower to survive. Read this book and give it to everyone you know."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"I first stumbled across &quot;The Raft&quot; over twenty years ago. In 1982 I left my copy in the back of a taxicab.

Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"The raft","review":"Mr. Trumbull did an adequate job of documenting Chief Petty Officer Dixon's narration of their 34-day raft ordeal. The writing is very straight forward with little in the way of colorful prose. It reads almost like a military dissertation. Mr. Trumbull's writing style certainly wouldn't have been mistaken for John Updike's work. The retelling is also indicative of 1940's sensibilities and presentations. For example, the author and Officer Dixon avoided any use of profanity in the book. They alluded to it, but dodged actual usage of \\"colorful adjectives\\" as if they were monks in a monastry. Without question, the three men survived by a mixture of luck and moxie. Their odyssey is so compelling, it was easy to finish this novella. However, the writing is so bland, I would not have stuck with the story if the book had been twice its actual length. The Raft is a fine example of human endurance."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"I read The Raft several times as a teenager and through my young adult years---45-55 years ago!

I was hot, sunburned, thirsty, feeling the sun, the rain, the wind,the salt water, etc. Having now run across the book on Amazon, I can't wait to get a copy and look forward to enjoying it again after all these years.

Why I read it was because our family was stationed at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. There is a museum there with many wonderful naval artifacts. One of them was the actual raft that those three sailors journeyed on for over 37 days. My mouth dropped open when I saw it 'in the flesh'. It is tiny. I immediately found the book and read it.

There was a strong need for a solar-powered out-board motor."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"This book barely leaps over 100 pages and can be read in a single day (maybe single sitting) but don't misconstrue its brevity as lacking content. After reading some \\"amazing\\" books recommended by friends that were fictional but had a strong message, it was a breath of fresh air to read a Navy man's recount of his factual ordeal at sea.The author purports to be transcribing direct from an afternoon's interview with the officer, which explains the laid back storytelling of the account. It reads like an acquaintance telling a story over drinks or on a long car ride. That also explains why sometimes the story jumps a bit, the officer adds in details that he might have forgotten from earlier, or jumps forward to explain how certain early decisions played out.The story itself is fascinating: what real men did to kill time, keep sane, and improve chances for rescue over a timespan longer than a month still boggles my mind. There was not a single page that I did not wonder if I could've had that resolve in their situation. And yet the men do not come across as supermen, instead as simple, average Navy seamen dealing with each day as it comes. It is a story that they feel they could easily have not told and been fine; they are not looking for accolades or book deals, just getting on with their lives and their war."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"&quot;The Raft&quot; is a &quot;No Frills&quot; true story. The facts of the adventure provide any excitement that a reader may require. I enjoyed the frankness.

In the fictional book The Raft by Robert Trumbull this is a reality.The main character of this story is officer Dixon, who was the pilot of a plane that crashed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Officer Dixon was a leader of the two other men, Gene and Tony. He was determined to sail the raft and bring them back to safety. He made most of the decisions for the others. The raft was only 8ft by 4-foot, and was only meant for one person. The only supplies they had were a pocketknife and a gun. When it rained out they used their clothes to catch the rain to drink. To catch their food they used their knife and a gun. They caught some fish, and a tiger shark to eat. They had to eat the food raw because they had no way to cook it. Gene had an encounter with a shark. He gets a shark bite on his hand, but he manages to survive. They are not aware that a hurricane is about to hit them.I would recommend this book because it is very interesting, it kept my attention, and it was suspenseful.Dilan McCaffery"},{"Title":"The raft","review":"I first read &quot;The Raft&quot; in high school around 1955.

They fought off starvation, heat, boredom &amp; all the dangers the ocean affords. Boys will like it even though it doesn't have the violence of most war stories.

Easy to stay with on a long drive."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"This is an account of 3 crewmembers of a ditched bomber surviving for 34 days in a very small, ill-equipped raft. The story is interesting enough to tell itself, so I felt that the straightforward writing style was quite appropriate.Although the book was actually written by a journalist, it is written in the first person as if the pilot, Harold Dixon, were telling the tale.The events occurred in early 1942, and the book was also published in 1942. The edition I read was the original, and did not mention John M. Waters anywhere, so I don't know why his name is listed as an author in the 1992 reprint.The fact that this book was written shortly after Pearl Harbor is borne home by the fact that there are several details (such as the location of the island where they washed up) that the author omits \\"for reasons of national security\\". Also, the jacket of the original 1942 edition says \\"When you have finished reading this book, don't just place it on a shelf. Our men need books as well as guns. Books build morale. Send this book today. Average book requires 6 cents postage.\\" They give the address of the 4th Corps Area Headquarters in Atlanta.If you enjoy this sort of tale, you'll probably also like \\"Adrift: Seventy-six Days Lost at Sea\\", by Steve Callahan, a bit more philosophical account of his more recent lone ordeal in the Atlantic."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"I am a high school English teacher and have used this book in my classes for over twenty years.

I must however point out that being the neice of Anthony Pastula and Gene Aldrich that this book is somewhat misleading, basically because it is from one person's viewpoint that had to be the hero. The plane, btw, didn't exactly crash. After being told several times by both my Uncles that they were running out of fuel, IT RAN OUT OF GAS!!! Not something the hero of his book would confess to I suppose. My Uncle's were also not helpless, uneducated, weaklings as they are sometimes made out to be either. They weren't that GREEN. They also had nothing to do with this book, because obviously, their recounts of their time at sea didn't match Dixon's. They both chose to step out of the spotlight and go on with their lives. For those that did wonder in the other reviews, they not only remained the closest of friends but they became brother-in-laws! Gene married Tony's sister. To add to that, Gene's sister married Tony's brother and that's where I come from! It is truly by the grace of God and Gene's strong personal believe in the Lord that he shared with the other two men that saved them."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago as a book-of-the-month paperback selection in jr high school. It is still a fascinating, true life survival story. But rereading it as an adult I find some interesting questions arise that I had not considered back then. Such as, it seems that Dixon is given too much credit for their survival when in fact it was his navigational errors that led to the ditching of the plane in the first place. The story was told by Dixon to a reporter and it is not surprising therefore that he comes off the best of the three. In the story for instance he always refers to the others as &quot;boys&quot; and tends to downplay their contributions. It is interesting that the &quot;boys&quot; became lifelong friends and had little to do with Dixon after the rescue. I think it would have been interesting to hear their version of the story and compare it with Dixon's. Nevertheless, what these three sailors managed to live through and triumph over, is truly inspirational and fascinating reading. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"In 1942, the American military was heavily engaged in fighting the Japanese in the Pacific theater. After the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor, U. S. and Allied military forces were in full retreat everywhere. The U. S. aircraft carriers regularly sent up patrol plains searching for the enemy. At that time, navigation was not yet precise and radio silence had to be maintained. Therefore, a plane sent out sometimes had difficulty finding their way back.Such a plane was piloted by Chief Petty Officer Dixon and his crew of two, Tony Pastula and Gene Aldrich. Losing their bearings while on patrol, the plane ran out of fuel and splashed down, sinking quickly. It sank so fast that there was no time to recover their emergency rations, so they had little more than the blowup boat and the clothes they wore.For thirty-four days, they floated, drinking the rainwater they could capture and eating what raw fish and bird meat they could catch. Finally, they drifted to a small, inhabited island where the leader had a radio. They were able to send a message out and were rescued shortly after.This book is the story of their ordeal, how they managed to keep everything together as they floated across the Pacific It is a story of survival against the odds and is an uplifting story, one that was badly needed in 1942 when it appeared that the Japanese forces were unstoppable."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"The story is an astounding tale of survival - 3 Navy airmen completely lost ast sea, bobbling in a tiny rubberized raft before the development of more advanced navigational equipment, and more attention to survival kits that came about later in the war.While the narrative does touch on moments of anger and doubt, it is told with a staunch 1940s, WW II bravado that concentrates more on the bravery and resourcefulness of the 3 protagonists. Whereas today, a story of this sort would probably include the psychological and philosophical issues that arose, and the deep thoughts that men in this predicament would undoubtedly experience, the tale comes across instead like a John Wayne movie. The courage and fortitude of Dixon (the narrator) putting the morale of his raftmates above the secret truths he knows - that things might be worse than they appeared (and one has to wonder how much worse they could possibly get!) seems to come up a few times, for example. Very little weakness, very little disagreement, very little real fear is described, or even acknowledged during the ordeal these men suffered.It's a fascinating story, and a tale of resroucefulness that is inspiring, but I'd agree with one of the earlier reviewers that \\"something is missing.\\" I think it's what's hidden under the shroud of what was the style of the day. Bravado. It lacks the vulnerabilty that might might make the story more human, more firightening, more true to life. I believe this is what ultimately keeps you from getting as involved in the characters and events as you might, and feeling that you are really experiencing what happened on that tiny raft, adrift as sea."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"My ten year-old son and I looked forward to story time every night for three weeks until we finished this book.The tale takes you from beginning to end, one day at a time. It traces the emotional and physical waves along with endless waves of challenges. Protection from the sun, wind, and storms, struggling for every drop of water and scrap of food, and overcoming the hopelessness of being adrift, day after day after day after day - it is sobering, but tremendously entertaining.It was astonishing that these men were given little choice of survival gear. They had to make use of the few things they could grab from their sinking plane and the contents of their pockets. To read of the grief over their loss of a safety pin vividly punctuated the dire nature of their situation. Their ingenuity proved who is the &quot;mother of invention&quot; without a doubt.The book was not stiff or sloppy, like many historical accounts of adventure (Kon Tiki comes to mind). It was also a good discussion starter for topics like teamwork, values, and God.Fighting the earth to save your frail, floating, flesh is a timeless story line. There are no human villians, moral complexity, or social considerations outside of their bobbing 8-foot raft. It's a classic.Check it out, or buy a copy for yourself, your kids, and generations to come...."},{"Title":"The raft","review":"A couple of things to consider:As a 22-plus year Navy man, I beg to differ with some points;1. Chief Harold Dixon was a 22-year Navy veteran, and nearly 20 years older than Tony Pastula and Gene Aldrich.In those days, he would have referred to them as &quot;boys&quot; in either the vernacular, or because of his age difference, or that he held a senior rank. This used to be a term of friendship.The &quot;boys&quot; became fast friends -- speaking from the 1942 version, what do you know that I don't about their later association (or lack of association with Chief Dixon)?2. Dixon's navigation errors did lead to their ditching -- This has little to do with his credit for their survival.He displayed leadership that led to his being awarded the Navy Cross, one of our country's highest honors. This was awarded not on his word, but with considerable input from his fellow survivors. The Navy does not give out the Navy Cross lightly.3. I don't think he comes off any better than the other 2 Sailors, in regards his actions. He had 20 more years of experience and had nearly the same amount of leadership experience, but Tony and Gene acquitted themselves well.The story remains one of the most powerful tales of survival ever told. I also highly recommend it!John Bayer"},{"Title":"The raft","review":"From a literary perspective, as tales of survival go, this one is not on top of my list. There's something missing to the story. Maybe it is the fact that the dramatic element is not there (after all, this is a transcript of conversations that the author had with one of the men). The result is that this reads more like a dry account of what happened, instead of the thriller i was expecting.In any event, it is amazing that these poor men were able to withstand the terrible conditions of their ordeal and live to tell. I was disappointed that only the officer received the medal, while the sailors simply got commendations. Well, the officer is the one who got them lost in the first place!This would be a good book for a teenager, because it reads extremely fast (at a good pace, maybe 2 hours), and it tells a story of extreme adversity and resourcefulness, and there's many youngsters out there that could take heed."},{"Title":"Track & Field Coach's Survival Guide: Practical Techniques and Materials for Building an Effective Program and Success in Every Event","review":"As a Masters athlete, as well as a sometimes assistant coach, I have found this book to be of immense value.

These lectures, subsequently published under the title _Naming and Necessity_, were quickly recognized as one of those rare events that turns the world of philosophy on its ear. Amazingly, Kripke was a mere 29 years old at the time and he delivered the lectures without any notes. This book reflects both the advantages and shortcomings of the spoken form: it is clear, engaging, and often witty, but it is also repetitive at times and frustratingly incomplete at others.It is perhaps fitting that Kripke delivered these lectures the same year that Bertrand Russell passed away, since their main target is the descriptivist theory of names associated with Russell. According to Russell - and to the reigning philosophical orthodoxy until 1970 - names are best analyzed as abbreviated definite descriptions, i.e. as unique sets of properties possessed by their bearers. However, Kripke argues that on this analysis, all such properties belong to their possessors necessarily - which is obviously false. For instance, if the name \\"Billy Strayhorn\\" just means \\"The composer of 'Take the \\"A\\" Train,'\\" then there is no possible world in which Billy Strayhorn did not compose the song. But this is false: Even if Billy Strayhorn had never written any songs, he would obviously still be Billy Strayhorn. What a puzzle!In place of descriptivism, Kripke proposes the theory of direct reference, according to which a name \\"rigidly designates\\" its referent in every possible world in which it exists. That is, a name is just a \\"tag\\" attached to its referent, with no descriptive content whatsoever. Kripke also proposes an alternative theory for how names are transmitted, the causal theory of names. For Kripke, the name I use for Strayhorn is \\"his\\" name in virtue of the fact that it is related, by means of some appropriate causal chain, to Strayhorn himself.Much of this was anticipated by other philosophers, though this often goes unnoticed. But Kripke developed his theory in a highly interesting way and put it to all sorts of surprising uses. His discussion of necessity and possibility almost single-handedly resurrected essentialism and gave a major impetus to contemporary modal metaphysics. He claims that names for natural kinds, such as \\"gold\\" and \\"tiger,\\" rigidly designate their referents and argues that this establishes the existence of necessary a posteriori truths. He closes the book by offering an essentialist argument against the mind-body identity thesis.In short, Kripke has given philosophers much to talk about. Indeed, _Naming and Necessity_ has spawned a whole cottage industry of commentary. In my view, Kripke's project is flawed in many (though not all) respects. For instance, his causal theory is too vague to be of much use, and his argument that natural kind terms directly refer seems question-begging. Nonetheless, Kripke's book is extremely provocative, interesting, important, and even fun."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"No, really. Kripke maintains a vigorously-argued and important thesis here: the surprising conclusion that statements involving identity (e.g., when calling something or someone out by name) involve a posteriori necessity. This is quite striking because many have assumed that necessity was somehow substantially correlative with the a priori: but that involves a confusion of metaphysical necessity with epistemological necessity. With that idea in place, Kripke goes on to apply (all too briefly, unfortunately) it in some extremely thought-provoking--nay, well-nigh mind-blowing--ideas about things like natural kinds and the mind-body problem. I just wish he had gone into way more detail on these fascinating issues than the three oral lectures transcribed on these 180 or so pages.If you're reading this review, you've either a) already read this and I don't have to tell you how unique and important it is, or b) maybe have just taken an undergraduate philosophy course that had some lectures on Kripke, and are thinking about checking out the primary literature yourself. If the latter, do so. You'll be enriched, and you might just be taken on a journey from which you'll never return. Philosophers are still, and undoubtedly will continue for some time, discussing the thesis of _Naming and Necessity_ and its implications for at least philosophy of language and metaphysics, and probably philosophy of mind and philosophy of science as well."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"The Millian semantics of proper names; the separation of semantics from the theory of how the semantics gets generated; the staunch insistence on the necessity of identity; the rehabilitation of &quot;non-linguisitic&quot; necessity&quot;; the generation of the class of the necessary a posteriori from the semantics; the extension of the approach to proper names to the semantics of general terms; the consequences for metaphysics and the interpretation of science; the extension of _this_ to the mind-body problem; the tantalizing hints about fictional names; the skepticism about the possibility of conceptual analysis and the cosequent support for rationalist metaphysics; the huge quantity of material to be mined from footnotes -- all of these features and many more are radical and absolutely essential contributions of this book."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"CUNY's Saul Kripke is the premier logical mind of our time, and this book (rightly acclaimed as a classic of analytic philosophy) is a friendly introduction to considering the topic he made *intellectually* tractable: the role of modalities in thought. In three 1970 lectures (originally published in the Synthese volume *Semantics of Natural Language*) Kripke ran through the contribution of \\"counterfactual\\" reasoning involving tacit use of modal logic to several philosophical debates. Although his conclusions are none too tentative, if you can stand to countenance the thought of Holy Roman United Nations after reading this book you could also come to appreciate the moral of its reception (aptly put by Oxford's Michael Dummett in an article entitled \\"Could There Be Unicorns?\\", but rumored of by Montagovians some time previously).Kripkean semantics for modal logic created an extremely flexible, pluralistic framework for assessing the role of modalities in reasoning, but is often taken in the form in which it is presented (here) to constitute a return to Aristotelian scholasticism. And although much work inspired by \\"Naming and Necessity\\" does allow such a construal perhaps \\"metaphysical\\" reasoning fits other conformances as well, and thoughts had by greats going back as far as you like live a life in the present somewhat other than one might think -- and if the reader will go this far with Kripke, today there are ample tools available for going *much* further. A supremely important book, which has in my opinion not been \\"outlived\\" by its extremely warm initial reception."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"If ever there was a time in history (and there have been many), when reality seems to be doubted and truth seems illusive, that time is now. With the reductio ad absurdum of post-modernism, Kripke restores the viability and stability of naive realism by fixing the referent in linguistic activity. It's a brilliant move, and one that has withstood the antagonists with suave and elegant argument. What Kripke has done is completely undermine the whole post-modernist project, which, at its core, attempts to deconstruct every semblance of reality. By using the very same tools, namely language, Kripke shows how the post-modernists have failed, and why they have.Intellectual skepticism is a healthy attitude for any critical thinker, but this very-well written argument on the necessity of naming that establishes and stabilizes our world around us is a must for all students of philosophy, and for all disiciplines that believe &quot;differance&quot; makes all the difference. Kripke shows that it does not."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"I would happily have hiven this book 4 stars if it hadn't been for the third lecture - it very nearly provoked a 1 star review. Why?Let's start from the beginning: Kripke makes a very persuasive argument to the effect that we know named objects simply by their names, rather than via a definite description. Thus, the example that one can know of 'Feynman' without knowing anything about him other than that he is a famous physicist, a description so far from being definite that it could apply to any number of people. So, a name is a 'rigid designator', something we use to point out a particular item, but not itself simply shorthand for a description.This is all good stuff, though it has the mild flaw that such rigid designators cannot achieve any meaning beyond one individual's mind unless they have some association to a description. For example, if you hear me talking about 'Cicero' without giving any description, then you have heard the rigid designator, but you have nothing to attach it to. You need a description, even if it may change over time, and it may be inadequate, to get some idea of what the rigid designator refers to.Unfortunately, in the third lecture everything falls apart. First Kripke attempts to argue that 'heat' and 'molecular motion' are necessarily identical. This may be so if you're prepared to attach a description to the rigid designator 'heat', something along the lines of 'the sensation which I feel under certain kinds of sensory stimulation, which can be shown by experiment to correspond with the action of causing mercury to expand and contract'. If you don't have that description, you have two entirely separate concepts: the intuitive sense of 'temperature' derived from sensation, and 'calorific heat', a scientific concept based around mean kinetic energy in ensembles of molecules. The description is what links the two, and so without that description, Kripke's argument collapses. But the description is precisely the thing he refuses to accept. In fact the argument collapses anyway, because in no way is it necessary that calorific heat and the sensation of temperature should be identical.Now things get worse. In this argument Kripke acknowledges quite happily that 'heat' = 'stimulation of certain nerve fibres'. But then he attempts to argue that while that equation is necessary, the equation of pain with stimulation of other nerve fibres isn't! He commits such open lunacy as the following: '...it would seem that God need only create beings with C-fibers capable of the appropriate type of physical stimulation . . . it would seem, though, that to make the C-fiber stimulation correspond to pain, or tbe felt as pain, God must do something in addition to the mere creation of the C-fiber stimulation; He must let the creatures feel the C-fiber stimulation as pain, and not as a tickle, or as warmth, or as nothing.' But this applies equally well to heat, so why was Kripke happy with that equation?The problem appears to be a very elementary mistake in modal logic, which I would not have expected of Kripke. Viz, he assumes that any conceivable counter-factual counts as a possible world accessible from this one (e.g. a counter-factual in which I feel pain but my C-fibres are not stimulated). But this is only the case in the strong S5 modal logic. In more realistic modal logics, possible worlds are joined by a complex accessibility relation, such that necessity in a world depends on truth in all worlds accessible from that one, not in all possible worlds. Just because Kripke can imagine such a counter-factual, it does not make it a world accessible from this one.So, in conclusion: buy it, read it, but don't treat it as holy writ. Personally, I'd stick to Quine."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"&quot;It's all just about language, not about the truly deep issues in metaphysics.&quot;You've got to be kidding!

So much has been written about this book that hardly any comment can be added. Yet, I still feel the &quot;necessity&quot; of writing my own view. The first lecture catches the reader a little unprepaired, jumping directly to the core of the argument, which develops in the second lecture and is expanded in the third. The third lecture is probably the best, with the discussion about natural kinds being my personal favorite. All the important names of analytic philosophy somewhat converge on this book, it is a classic, a revolutionary and inspiring book. It is also very direct: the reader will be put face to face with old philosophical problems in naming, identity, necessity and a priori knowledge and their most ingenious and clear analysis. This book is analytic philosophy at its best, buy it."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Originally published in 1972, Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity is a compilation of three lectures given by the author in January 1970 at Princeton University. Aside from transcripts of the lectures (with minor editing), the text includes a brief preface and postscript (or agenda as Kripke calls it) with some helpful points of clarification. Kripke is regarded by many as the pre-eminent philosopher of recent times- while Naming and Necessity is widely viewed as the most significant piece of post-Wittgenstein analytic philosophy.In the book Kripke discussion of a range of issues and questions that has altered the trajectory of modern philosophy including:* Accidental and essential properties,* Theories of reference (direct reference v. descriptivist)* Epistemic and metaphysical necessity (he poses the possibility of necessary a posteriori truth and contingent a priori truth)Readers unfamiliar (or rusty) with Kripke may find the pertinent chapters in Scott Soames' excellent Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2: The Age of Meaning helpful in preparing to engage Naming and Necessity. The small text \`On Kripke' in the Wadsworth series is also useful and even more introductory.Overall, this is an important work in analytic philosophy that would make a valuable addition to any collection. As with much modern philosophy in the analytic tradition familiarity with the genre and subject matter is a perquisite to fully understanding and appreciating the discussion (that said this book has a nice flow). My comments pertain to the 2005 reprint by Harvard."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"The proper analysis of language is more important for philosophy than practically any other project (an exception is the proper understanding of logic, and perhaps the right ontology). This is true even if your primary philosophical interest is &quot;spirituality&quot; and the &quot;World Soul&quot;, whatever that is. The importance of language is recognized even by Continental philosophers, given their concern with semiotics, structuralism, etc. Analytic philosophers, needless to say, have always understood it, and none more so than Kripke. Kripke does an incredible job of clearing up a mass of confusions that have surrounded the notion of necessity ever since the days of Hume and Kant. In terms of its philosophical importance, this book is comparable to &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; or &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;; it ought to be read by every analytic philosopher. END"},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Saul Kripke's \\"Naming and Necessity\\" is arguably the greatest piece of philosophy of the twentieth century. It has reshaped philosophy of language and metaphysics, and has significantly influenced philosophy of mind and epistemology, among other areas of philosophy.\\"Naming and Necessity\\" is largely a transcription of three lectures that Kripke delivered when he was 29 years old - without lecture notes. The book reflects the informal style of these lectures; it is friendly and engaging, albeit sometimes unclear.Among other things, Kripke refutes descriptivist theories about the meaning and reference of proper names and natural kind terms, and develops a new account in their place; defends the modal concepts of necessity and possibility, and distinguished between necessity and a prioricity; and argues that there are necessary truths knowable only a posteriori and contingent truths knowable a priori.Of course, the book has some critics. However, in my opinion, Kripke does not commit some of the errors of which he has been accused in other reviews here.I think that the book will be very difficult for those unfamiliar with analytic philosophy, especially philosophy of language. I recommend \\"Naming and Necessity\\" for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in philosophy. I also recommend Soames's two-volume \\"Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century\\", which culminates with an excellent exposition of \\"Naming and Necessity\\" but which is also difficult for beginners."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Intro:This book is comprised of lectures Kripke gave in Jan 1970 at Princeton. The transcript was taken from the lectures verbatim and &quot;lightly&quot; edited. Kripke happened to be 29 at the time. (A very wise 29 indeed!)The books grammatically and punctuation construction can make you mad at times, but generally the writing (speaking) flows pretty well.The book's overall tone is highly specific but never pretentious, as many philosophers are known to be. Kripke also embodies something rare for a philosopher -a sense of humor.Despite the length of 164 pages, the work is incredibly dense but repetitive enough that if read closey can be readily understood.Summary:Kripke starts out by defining the terms he is going to use in the following lectures. A 'referent of the description' is the object uniquely satisfying the conditions of the expression. A 'rigid designator' implies in &quot;every possible&quot; world something that is unchanged or the same object. The &quot;possible worlds&quot; talk is about the theory of probability on a large scale. (Insert: &quot;Any world that was possible to happen had it have been any other way.&quot;)The first big thing he rejects is that a priori statements are not necessary and can be contingent and a posteriori truths can be necessary. Kripke then later on rejects the &quot;cluster of descriptions.&quot; The name means the same and it still won't be a rigid designator. Kripke's quandry gets multiplied when he claims that even if in a possible world some of the descriptions didn't fit the object in question it would still be what it is (i.e. socrates would still be socrates even if he wasn't the man from Athens.) In the second lecture he highlights the previous talk as &quot;transworld-identification strain.&quot;Even if the conditions don't satisfy to uniquely identify the speaker, the speaker still recieved the reference through a line of communication that was real. As far as synonyms are concerned we have to find out that something is still that same something (even though it has a different name) only empirically. (i.e. Hesperus is Phosphorus -can't be known a priori! Therefore an example of the a posteriori truth.)From general terms (i.e. cow) one can't know the properties that would uniquely identify an individual. He then agrees with Mill against Russell and Frege on particular names but not on general naming. He ends the book rather abruptly in my opinion where he leaves the reader with Gold has the specific weight that it has in all possible and a specific name that fixes a referent is a priori true.Conclusion:Perplexing...I probably did a bad job with that summary but it was the best I could do. I'll probably read the book again but I recommend if you read this to get the historical work he talking about to follow along (Mill, Frege, Russell). Kripke could have revised this properly to make it a little more clearer. Minus the clarity though this book is a gem that'll make you think about naming in a new way."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Actually, many works written by analytic philosophers are difficult for beginners to understand. However, this one written by Saul Kripke is more easy and fun because it was originally three lectures delivered by the author at Princeton University. Therefore, many vocabularies and expressions in the book are not much technical, but more colloquial. If you want to read analytic philosophy like listening to an easy and fun talk, Naming and Necessity is the proper one for you."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Kripke's much celebrated work should be read by everyone who has a serious interest in philosophy of language. Kripke claims that names are rigid designators, i.e. words that refer to the same in all possible worlds. This is intimately conncted to Kripke's strong thesis, that names do not have meaning. In my opinion this work, although HIGHLY original, is just based on dubious exaples, some of the language-users in Kripke's examples do not master the language they attempt to use at all. Does this provide suffiencient basis for saying something whoch is signifcant about language?Personally, I believe that meanings are in the head, and if i did not have knowledge in my head when I refer to Kripke, I would not really be refering to Kripke.Kripke also writes about necessity. This is creative work. But if I remember correctly, he says the &quot;This wooden table is not made of ice&quot; is an a priori particular truth. I think he does a serious mistake here. He does realize that this knowledge is derived from the two premises: (1) This is a wooden table, (2) If a table is made of wood, it is not made of ice. now the first prop, I think anyone should agree that is empirical. (I believe the second is too). So this is not known a priori.But Kripke is very interesting. His book should be read. But what happened to Wittgenstein's &quot;only death gives life it's meaning&quot;. When did this leave philosophy?"},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Naming and Necessity is one of the classics of 20th century philosophy. If you haven't read this book, I suggest you drop your current reading and pick this up.

Although there is a debate on Kripke's originality in the new theory of reference, I don't think it could affect its status in the 20th Century Analytic Philosophy.

I thus recommend those who want to write on the theory of reference should have a thorough reading of this book."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"I know that this book is famous and everything, but it's not an easy read, and i remain unconvinced.

The most appropriate truth value is incomplete. However, the truth value is not the exciting part of the book. It is the possible that science is metaphysically necessary. If we take names to be rigid designates and the names are contingently identical, then they are necessarily identical. Kripke's example is \\"Heat is the motion of molecules\\". Once heat is identified with the motion of molecules, then they most be identical in all possible worlds. This understanding of names (if correct) shields science from most forms of skepticism. The only form of skepticism left is the mundane possibility of miscalculating.Kripke's thesis is grandiose in its implications and plausible, these two qualities make it valuable. Even though it is an important thesis, I think Kripke's understanding of identity is flawed. He uses his thesis to justify \\"a cat is an animal\\" has a necessary truth. However, identity is reflexive and an animal is a cat is not necessarily true. So, Kripke's identity must be an implication of sorts. Or Kripke's identity only holds for a subgroup of rigid designates."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Put the dog out, slip on your fuzzy velveteen loafers, pour yourself a glass of cabernet sauvignon, pack your pipe full of a tobacco -- the smell of which reminds you of days at sea, settle into that worn leather chair -- the one that belonged to your grandfather and get ready to dive into one of the most delicious philosophical texts since derrida's last book.

The home equity loan does have a lower interest rate but is a terrible idea for many consumers. What happens is the loan uses the family home to secure credit card debt that was previously unsecured. Lots of families lose their homes this way. Also, if the family files bankruptcy, the credit card debt that might have been dischargeable gets paid off by selling the home. Thus, \\"simple math\\" is not necessarily as simple as it appears to the unsophisticated reader.Elizabeth Warren is one of the most influential law professors and scholars in this area of law and has written multiple leading textbooks on these subjects.

It is great for young people just starting out, for older people to recoup their losses, and for the middle class to correct their errors, and guarantee a more free and happy life. You may have to sacrifice to achieve your goals, but the advice wherever you find yourself financially is crystal clear and effective. Whether you make $25,000, $50,000, or $150,000, if you understand their formula, you will eventually find yourself in a better financial position over time, and you can even enjoy the journey and have the feeling of a job well done.

They themselves have been single mothers, taught business to Harvard law students, and have conducted financial counseling clinics for people on the edge of poverty as well as for those who are economically more fortunate. If it is too complex for anyone to understand, that person or persons should study to understand finance until the message the book is sending is clear to them, and they will avoid a lot of financial stress and chaos in their life."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"There are some troubling aspects of this book such as its overly simplistic views of real estate and stock market investing. For example, 10.4% (2005 Yearbook, Ibbotson Associates), not 12% is a historical average stock market return over a 80 year period which includes dividends which may be spent and not reinvested. Investment returns vary widely over shorter periods of time, such as most people's lives. Real estate does on average increase in value only slightly higher than the inflation rate but the financial leverage, tax advantages and the need for shelter make it the best long term investment most Americans make. The benefits of smart purchasing are also minimized when small savings and savvy money management can really add up to sizable sums over a lifetime.Some of the \\"evil banks\\" rhetoric and a longing for the \\"good old days\\" of banker paternalism indicates a big government mindset rather than giving people more freedom and accepting some bad outcomes as a price you pay for expanded freedom of choice. Also, strict regulation can stifle innovation and many people would have missed out on the American dream of homeownership if the rigid lending formulas of the past were still mandatory. The market economy rests on sellers and buyers pursuing their opposing interests; buyers of credit need to be alert and to educate themselves rather than blaming others for their bad credit decisions.Nevertheless, I applaud the authors for giving readers a simple formula for financial planning and for extolling the virtues of thrift and living an affordable lifestyle. Too many Americans have embraced living beyond their means and now feel lost in the woods without a financial compass to guide them. This book points readers in the right direction by distinguishing between necessities and desires while still putting some money aside for a rainy day and for investment. It may seem obvious but this method is guaranteed to improve the financial situation of nearly everyone.In addition, the book is not a dry financial planning text as it is interspersed with the lives and struggles of families who find a path away from financial misery. People who understand derivatives and sophisticated financial planning can skip it but this would be a different society if most adults played the financial game by the author's rules. Read it and use it to chart a path toward a better financial future; you will thank yourself later."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This is simply a great book.

It is also filled with great advice on insurance plans and what you really need to have.I think this would be a great book to read if you have not bought a house yet. Luckily, we didn't listen to our realtor's advice and didn't spend more on a house that he said we \\"could afford\\". When we read this book to try to get our finances in order (after we bought the house) we realized that our needs just sqeak in at 50% - and we don't have any car payments or credit card debt. Thanks, dude! I feel that the worksheets in this book would be a great to do before you buy a house so that you will know what you really can afford.In sum, I found this book to contain simple, sensible advice that is easy to follow and thankfully does not take a lot of time or effort - or else we would not be following it.

Unlike most personal finance books, All Your Worth doesn't purport to be a primer on every kind of investment under the sun. And it's not a prescriptive screed, admonishing readers for spending too much on this or that. As long as you're meeting your goals of limiting \\"needs\\" (rent or mortgage, basic food and transportation expenses, legal obligations) to 50% and saving 20% of your post-tax income, you're able to spend the other 30% however you wish: on nice shoes, vacations, fancy meals, skydiving lessons, whatever you desire.The plan is simple and laid out step-by-step with illustrative stories from the authors' experiences advising normal, middle class people like you and me about their finances. It also recommends sticking to cash and doesn't force you to total up each individual expenditure. Sure, some people may like or be good at this sort of accounting, but it's not feasible to write down everything you buy if it's not your personality type.Perhaps the best part of this book is the simple (but not simplistic) common sense it exudes. I appreciated that Warren and Tyagi explicitly differentiate between \\"needs\\" and \\"wants.\\" The media present constant consumption as the norm, so it's nice to hear that, no, this is not how life should be.

I doubt these people still own a home.This book is not a crash course in paying off debt, but is a good way to deal with money in a sustainable way over your lifetime. Warren encourages 50% of income towards all must-haves (food, shelter, anything with a contract), 20% towards savings or debt repayment and 30% towards whatever. By not denying yourself or your family (ie. following instead a 50% must haves and 50% debt repay/savings budget) you can stick to the budget every month instead of feeling denied and binging on a big fun expense after a while.

Thank you Ms. Warren!"},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"The information in this book was counterintuitive for me - as it is for a lot of people from reading from reading some of the negative reviews.Indirectly, over the years a lot of us are conditioned to use credit cards and debit cards. No, mom and dad didn't come out and say for us to do it like that, neither did any of the finance programs in school or the military. We do so because we heard things like using a credit card is more convenient than cash, that if your card is stolen that you're only liable for the first $50, that you get those cashback rewards.Those benefits come with a cost, however.One thing leads to another (life never seems to go 100% perfectly) and that leads to carrying a balance on a card. A credit card is a very expensive instrument for debt and leads to you not enjoying or being able to use ALL the money you earn.Reading this book, you see how life would work if you went all cash. I've done the 50%, 30%, 20% thing for awhile and I regret not doing it years ago. If only I had known (sigh). Truly, it hurts just a little to hand over cash for a purchase - that's a good thing. Cash is real. Cash is physical. It doesn't hurt so much to hand over a debit or credit card. I'm not spending so much time putting entries in Quicken for things that aren't tax-deductible (talk about a waste of time). Furthermore I'm able to use more of the money I earn for things that I really want to spend it on. I'm more secure because more of my house is paid off. Life improved with this book. I get to spend a little more time doing things I enjoy doing. That's worth whatever 1% kickback I got from my credit card company."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This is the book for regular people who worry about money, never seem to be able to get on firm footing (no matter how many frugal tips they utilize), and can't understand how money has become such a huge focus in their lives.It's kinder and gentler than Dave Ramsey. The authors encourage folks to follow a balanced approach: 50% of income for necessities and legal obligations; 20% for savings; and 30% for wants. Unsecured, consumer debts are paid from the 20% savings, so you don't have to shop exclusively at thrift stores and eat Ramen Noodles until your balances are paid. (If 20% of your income just won't pay off your debt over time, the authors also address bankruptcy.) Once consumer debt is gone, and an emergency fund is built, the authors encourage putting 1/4 of that savings toward what I'd call 'big wants'. A summer home, a dream wedding, a fantasy vacation. This is very clever: (a) because you've been putting all that savings toward, well, saving, it's like getting something back, (b) saving becomes fun (c) it presupposes you will wait for the 2nd home, the dream wedding and the vacation until you can pay for them.Retaining 30% for fun accomplishes three goals. One, the worksheets and the amount of money allocated make you own up to the fact that $99/ month, unlimited everything, cell phone service (or cable, or gym membership, or hair care) is not a need, even if it is a monthly expense. Secondly, it makes for a budget folks can actually stay on for more than a few months. Finally, it cuts down on fights within the family; families can decide together if they want high-speed Internet more than they want to eat out. Kind of, here's the spending money, what do we want to spend it on? This is much nicer than \\"are you out of your mind, we can't afford that!\\"But keeping obligations and necessities to 50% is the heart and soul of the program. It not only frees up money for saving and for fun, it also ensures that you have a financial plan that can weather life's ups and downs. Imagine if you could get by indefinately if one spouse lost their job just by cutting out cable and other perks. The hard part (for me) was realizing I had over-committed myself in this area. Cutting back took more time than the book seemed to assume, because many of my obligations just had to run their course. This is the only issue I wish the authors had spent more time on. But I was still able to tweak their advice to fit my particular circumstance.There is a lot of other good advice in this book. The information is practical and addresses not only what to do, but how to do it. I only wish I had read this book before I started my very first job. It would be a valuable graduation present, and I plan to give 2 next year."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"a very sound, very applicable and practical guide to saving money.

The real strengths of the book are that it gives people living on what used to be called middle incomes a different way of looking at our money and a reasonable (and not onerous) approach to budgeting. It also provides a great approach for couples to manage money and discuss money together. Unlike the budgets advocated by many other personal money management books, this one only needs to be done once (or once a year for those that are really motivated...)I do not agree with some of the advice, e.g. paying off your mortgage and NEVER using credit cards, but the basic approach to budgeting and the emphasis on using cash for discretionary spending is very, very useful (a l little unrealistic if groceries are included, but otherwise great)."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This book should be mandatory rading for every high school and college graduate. It explains how and why so many people are in financial trouble, and it clearly explains how to start saving and know where your money is going. It's tough if the majority of your income goes for necessities...but it give hope.It's very quick reading, easy to understand, and would motivate younger readers to help themselves before it's too late. I bought several copies and gave one to each of my 'grown' sons."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I do not have a 401K, medical insurance, stocks, bonds, or gold buried in a hole the ground. I consider myself lucky to have the clothes on my back and a home to live in. I have read many books about financial planning, but none as good, or as straight forward, as this one. By following the Balanced Money Formula for only one month, I have saved $970.00. For the first time I am not checking my balance daily because I have enough money to cover my bills. It is a very simple formula: must haves: 50%, wants: 30%, savings: 20%. The plan is simple and self-explanatory. Half your income goes to things you have to pay each month, like rent, mortgage, and utilities. Twenty percent is set aside for savings and thirty percent for fun. It is flexible and gives you tips on how to get everything balanced, this might mean eating out less or canceling cable. Because I had zero savings to begin with, I chose to take a lot from my wants and stash it in savings, until I can establish an adequate cushion.For potential home buyers/refinancers, you should read this book before you do anything. All Your Worth nicely explains how you can protect yourself from being taken advantaged of by mortgage lenders. There are no ten dollar words or complex financial terms to puzzle over. I regret not reading this book before I bought my home, however, I can use the information if I decide to refinance. So, if you are in the market to buy or refinance read pages 82-88, then read Chapter 8: The Big Buy.Most of us know how bad debt can be, but this mother/daughter duo writes that debt is just plain dangerous. They explain how yesterday's debt steals from tomorrow's income-a claim against your future-so think long and hard before you charge that latte or charge another pair of shoes you don't need.I usually donate books I have read or pass them on to friends, but not this one, this one is a keeper and I will be sharing it with my children so they, too, can learn how to survive this terrible economy and hopefully have a more secure future."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I am a 21 year old college student and had to read this book for a class this summer...

I especially recommend it for someone just entering the \`real world' post-school."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I know this book has been on the market for some time. I just picked up a used copy at a booksale.This book is excellent. It is for those of use who do not already have wealth, are maybe not quite ready to understand the ins and outs of investing and 401K's etc.I found some of the negative comments to this book to be silly and unfounded. A lot of the negative reviewers seem to already have in depth knowledge of financial matters- not a target for this book. Some people seem to be a little nitpicky on \\"musthaves\\" vs. \\"wants\\" Dog food and toothpaste are must-haves, not wants. If I was fired tomorrow, I would still have to buy them, so they are must-haves.For the people who seem to think this is oversimplified and wow, duh, everyone should understand not to spend more than they earn, well good for you for being way smarter than the rest of us and the thousands and thousands of Americans in financial trouble and with debt. It doesn't claim to be a workbook or a heavy duty financial guide, so I'm perplexed as to why someone would give it one star and complain about the contents when the Intro chapter tells you exactly what this book is and is NOT.I think this is a great starting place for evaluating your situation. Balance, in theory, seems to be a simple concept. In application, it is difficult to achieve for some of us whether it be with financial matters or food or worklife.I enjoyed this book, learned plenty & recommend it for people who are looking to get started saving and getting finances in order and who are not interested in be instructed to use a program of savings envelopes or receipt savings or keeping up with every last dime and where it goes. The same program doesn't work for everyone.I also recommend The Energy of Money by Maria Nemeth."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This book is easy to follow and understand.

It's a no-brainer approach with real-world examples and the best part is they give you space and worksheets to encourage you to write in it. I actually am still in the process of reading it (it makes you feel like crap with your spending - in a good way). It's an eye opening experience and it isn't one of those get-rich-quick schemes either. Honest information for general scenarios (if you have a highly atypical financial situation, it won't fit the book entirely but you will still walk away with valuable information).Good book, solid read."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"All Your Worth is well worth the read. This is how to approach that yucky topic of budgeting, without the pain of senselessly tracking, in detail, everything you spend.Three simple categories sum up what you are trying to do. When you get those dialed in, that is essentially all there is to it. Of course, it is a little more than that; however, they do a good job explaining how to tweak the basic concept to your situation.What makes this work helpful is that you can do away with having to track detail. As they explain, yes pennies add up. Nevertheless, concentrating on the pennies diverts your attention from the dollars. If you don't have an overall strategic focus, then tracking all the detail is pointless to begin with. Once you have things managed on a grander scale, then you can use all the consumer money saving tips, coupons, etc to tweak out the pennies and enhance your finances even further. Trying to do this in the opposite direction, first saving pennies and then working out what to do with them never quite seems to work. The very reason they wrote about trying a different approach.This is a great work in that is approaches how to manage your finances from the big picture down, rather than trying to work up to your total budget by tracking every cent and then being exhausted so as not to finish the most important next step - what is it you're trying to accomplish with all your spending?A complementary work to help you understand how to avoid thinking errors when you deal with your money isWhy Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes And How To Correct Them: Lessons From The New Science Of Behavioral Economicsby Gary Belsky and Thomas GilovichMy book picks up where All Your Worth leaves off - what are you trying to accomplish with all your spending?

Lots of great advice and worksheets to help you make the most of your money."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"While a lot of the principles in this book were good, the authors oversimplified the concepts of saving and money. They tell readers to save 20% of their after tax income, but where should they put it? They sugggest 10% in retirement accounts, but in what investments do you put that money? They never discuss 401ks and the very important concept of company match. What about IRAs and the differnt types? Where do you buy them and how do you invest within tem? And what do you do with the rest of the money you save? Where do you invest it? They suggested 5% to pay off your mortgage (what if you don't have one?) and 5% into index funds. It would be foolish to put all your money in one place. They gloss over diversification, then go on to say to put all your money in index funds. If the average person reading this book has no concept about debt, saving or anything else related to money, they won't know where to buy an index fund let along how much to invest and for how long. What about teachin people to have money deucted autmoatically towards their investments? They never talk baout that because the average person does not and will not budget.They have a short chapter on insurance, saying to get the cheapeast insurance you can get which is foolish. Studies show that 50% of people who go BANKRUPT are the ones with NOT ENOUGH insurance. They gloss over disability insurace when studies how 1 in 4 people collect in theif lifetimes. They say to keep an emergency fund (very good advice) and say to put it in a savings account (bad advice). Money markets and CDs are the best place right now for that money, where it is relativly liquid and still earns modest interest.However, The concept of 50-30-20 is a great concept, and the authors explain how different our relationsihp with money is vs. our parents. generation. The idea to pay cash for everyday things is excellent advice, pay off debt, etc.There is a much better book for people new to money and investing that is easy to understand and read. David Bach's books are the best. 'Smart women finish rich' or 'smart couples finish rich' is all you need. all his other books just say the same concepts in a different way. 'Smart women finish rich' is more in depth and comprehensive and covers everything you need to know from start to finish."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I learned of this book from Dr. Phil (who I like and respect). I found this book to be enormously simplistic and incorrect. I found the prose to be stilted and frankly boring to read.It simplistically says that everyone should save precisely 20% of your income! This is ludicrous as it depends on what you want and how much you already have.It is also simplistically labels all home equity borrowing as bad and dangerous! Again, it depends upon the circumstances.The book says that the stock market returns 12% per year. Every respected source I know of says no more than 10%. The authors cite no source or justification for this.They say that everyone should payoff their mortgage. Again highly simplistic. They also wrongly call the mortgage interest tax deduction a credit which it clearly is not.The authors also claim that their book is based on \\"more than 20 years of intensive research\\" but they never say what that is. I can only infer it's based upon talking with friends since they cite no statistics or research but give a handful of anecdotes.Sorry Dr. Phil but you got this one wrong."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"The main book is around 200 pages. This is a very expensive book for so little information and advice. I found the writing to be obtuse and and simplistic. I doubt the authors have any real experience in the real world.As a much better alternative, I highly recommend Personal Finance for Dummies."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This book was a chore to get through. I agree that some of the advice was solid, but it is a matter of people disciplining themselves to follow through on it. Therefore I would classify this as a motivational book, not a book that offers any kind of viable plan to become wealthy. The main theme is to get your \\"must-have\\" items under 50% of your total income. It should be evident to anybody that if you are spending more than this on the items you need to live and are not saving any money then there is a problem.I suppose I really have no complaint so far. Sometimes people need to read the obvious before taking action. But I did have a problem with some of the suggestiions from the women such as 1) Get a prepaid cell phone instead of signing up for a commitment with a company. Do they realize this will cost more in the long run? Or my favorite 2) Avoid a gym membership. Take up jogging instead. Are they serious? How is jogging a substitute for working your muscles or enjoying sports like racquetball?One more specific example of a flaw in their advice. The say do not take out a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt. I havent looked into the exact numbers, but home equity loans are around 6% while some people are paying back credit card debts at rates of well over 10%. Simple math says this would make sense to pay off your debts quicker.While the book means well, for people in financial trouble this is nothing groundbreaking. It is the job of the individual to simply practice common sense when dealing with money. We would all like to be able to save 20% of our income and reduce the expenses that we must have (car, rent/mortgage, gas) but do you have the discipline to buy within your means is the real question."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I read this book to my children every night before we go to bed. It is a magnificent fairytale on how the characters have 30% of their income devoted entirely to spending on wants and desires.

For example, in the equation for the yearly budget, how about including continually compounded interest for credit cards and other debts?

Or, maybe you're eyebrows-deep in debt and have no idea how to get the balances paid down. The majority of \\"financial guides\\" in existence aren't for you - why waste money on a book that tells you how to play the stock market to your advantage when you don't even have a savings account? Why waste your time reading about IRAs and CDs when they're not part of your vocabulary?\\"All Your Worth\\" is the first \\"money matters\\" book that gets it right - it speaks to the many individuals and families who struggle to stretch every paycheck. The idiotproof worksheets force you to get honest about your spending habits. The authors' advice is thoughtful, practical and above all, it makes sense. By guiding you through the financial exercises, the authors help you see how your money is divided into three areas - things you must spend money on each month (mortgage, groceries, etc), things you want to spend money on (such as karate lessons, trips to a pricey salon, etc) and a savings portion. By separating your monthly expenses into these areas, the authors help you see how your money is - or isn't - working to its advantage for you.The authors are speaking to a real audience - people for whom mutual funds and stock options aren't part of the daily vernacular. Warren and Tyagi are providing real advice for real people. They aren't promising to make you a millionaire - rather, they are providing solid advice to get you back on track, to stop worrying about whether a $35 haircut will cause your utility check to bounce and to get in charge of your finances."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I'll admit it. This book changed my life. Corny, I know. But it's true. I used to be horrible about paying my bills. I make decent money, but I was always late on every payment. My problem was that I was never quite sure what I could afford. If I pay the cable bill now, will I still have enough money to go out this weekend? Will my next paycheck clear before my rent check is cashed? I'm 28 years old, how much should I put into my 401(k)? Do I even need a 401(k)?Warren and Tyagi's book changed all that in a weekend. Their core idea is so simple, but when you put it into action, it is incredibly powerful. Basically, they say that in order to address all of your financial worries, you just need to put your money in balance. They have just three categories, Must-Haves, Wants, and Savings, and every dollar you make goes into one of these categories. For me, that means that I just take my paycheck to the ATM and spilt it up as I make my deposit. I put half into my checking account. Transfer 20% into my savings account. And the rest I take out in cash.What's so cool about dividing my money this way is that I never have to worry about bouncing a check. I know that there is always enough money to cover my bills because I only use my checking account to pay my bills. As for going out on the weekend, I have cash in my wallet and I just use that.Getting used to their system is a little awkward. I found myself going through a lot of my expenses asking is this a Want or a Must-Have? And the authors spend a long time blasting the credit card companies and credit card debt in general. They make Citicorp seem worse than Big Tobacco and Microsoft combined. But once I got my money into balance and started using cash to buy dvd's and go out to dinner, my day-to-day life got a lot less complicated. For the first time in my life I don't know to the penny how much I have in my checking account. I don't know which checks have cleared and which haven't. And I don't care.

I have my first \\"real\\" job, don't make much money, and was completely suckered by offers of free credit cards in college. I had pretty much given up on ever getting out of debt until I was ready to retire or hit the lottery. Then I got this book, desperate for ANY advice that would help me get rid of those ridiculous credit cards. And it has!!! Not only do I have a plan to be out of debt by the summer (COMPLETELY out of debt, I have to add), but I still have enough money every month to go out with my friends, go to the movies, or splurge on a few books. I never had much financial advice before and math is not my strong suit, but this book was so easy to follow, fun to read, and took so little time to set up my finances according to their plan. I can say with utter confidence that I know exactly where I stand financially at every moment of the day, and it's an unbelievable feeling. I've already started making plans to start saving for a house and a retirement plan!

Yes, it's very difficult to squeeze a budget into this framework. Yes, it's sometimes downright impossible to get down to 50/30/20. However, 50/30/20 is goal, just like aiming for cholesterol intake. A 65/25/10 budget is still a whole lot better than a 80/20 budget--or worse--a 70/35/0 budget (yeah, spending more than you earn...lots of us do this).By balancing your money--and the authors walk you through this process--you can focus your energy on the big ticket items and stop sweating over whether to buy Cherrios or generic \\"Tastee-Os\\" at the supermarket. If you find that a new purchase, like a car, a computer, a house, et al, will change your ratio for the worst, then you will know that's a big red flag. Finally, you will have the answer to \\"Can I afford it?\\", and you won't need to call Suze Orman every time you need to make a purchasing decision.So if you're living in Silicon Valley (we lived in Orange County, CA, so I understand), like one of the unhappy critics, then start your budget where it is. (Even if its 70/20/5) Use the balance plan to influence your future purchasing decisions and to evaluate your spending history.For the record, I am a stay-at-home wife/mom in my twenties, and our family of three lives on a Marine Corps seargent's salary. We have 20% of our income going towards savings. Two years ago, I was bringing home an additional $45,000/year, and we had $5,000 (+/-) of persistant credit card debt and auto loans, etc. We didn't even have our kid yet. Eek! Now, we have ZERO debt, growing savings, a retirement plan, and extra money for the fun stuff. Crazy, huh?"},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"All Your WorthWhen most people think of a personal finance book, they think of something similar to All Your Worth. At least it's what I think of: a guide to the emotions and the mechanics of getting your financial life straight in these times.I first came in contact with this book when I went to the library shortly after my financial meltdown - it was one of about eight or nine books on personal finance that the librarian thrust into my arms. I took it home and devoured it in one sitting, like I did most of the other books I read in that first batch. As with all of the other books I read in that batch, there was one key idea that stuck with me from this book, and that was that the real key to personal financial mastery is balance.Let's walk through the book so you can see what I mean.6 Steps To A Lifetime Of RichesThe first half of the book details a six-step plan for getting your finances in order. In general, the advice is pretty standard, but there are a few interesting twists.Step One: Count All Your WorthThe goal of this chapter is to do a complete financial accounting of where you are at, separating the money into three groups: must-haves, wants, and savings. Warren suggests that a healthy distribution between these three groups is 50% must-haves, 30% wants, and 20% savings - the further away from that balance that you are, the less enjoyable (or at least more stressful) your life likely is, particularly as the must-haves get higher. Instead of giving guidelines about how to get close to those target percentages, though, this section is mostly about calculating the percentages; the advice comes later.Step Two: Excape from the Thinking TrapsThis chapter is very psychological in nature - it deals with overcoming psychological traps to getting your money in shape, such as \\"But housing is too expensive\\" or \\"But I have kids\\" or \\"But my wife doesn't work.\\" For the most part, thoughts like these are just excuses to keep you from really whipping your money into shape. If you've got a reason like this that keeps you from really attacking your finances, you should clearly specify what the idea is, think about the goals you want to accomplish, then spend time researching and trying to understand whether the idea is actually preventing you from saving or if you're just using it as a crutch. Face it and take it on - that's the way to get past psychological traps.Step Three: Count the Dollars, Not the PenniesThis chapter, for me, was one of the highlights of the book as it clearly makes a really important point: a lot of the things that people define as \\"must-haves\\" are quite often not really \\"must-haves.\\" You might be living in a normal house in a normal suburb, driving a normal car, but if the continual payments on these are preventing you from building wealth, then you need to look at making a change in your life. But the neighbors have these things isn't an excuse - likely, your neighbors aren't building wealth, either.Following the All Your Worth plan, you need to trim your \\"must-haves\\" down to half of your take-home, so you might expect lots of frugal living tips. Well, that's not what you get. Instead, it's tips on how to trim big, sustainable pieces from your budget, like reevaluating your insurance, selling your car (or getting a cheaper, more efficient, or more reliable one), refinancing your mortgage, looking for a tenant, and so on. The key here isn't to spend your time clipping a coupon, but to look for things that will save significant money over the long run that can really change the percentage of your paycheck devoted to \\"must-haves.\\"Step Four: If You Can't Afford Fun, You Can't Afford Your LifeHere, the sacrifices that are made in the previous chapter pay off. If you get your must-haves down to around 50% and then actually save 20%, that leaves 30% of your income for your wants. That's great! But if you're not careful, spending money can burn you. Thus, the book really advocates setting spending limits and never spending money on wants that you don't already have in cold, hard cash - in other words, no more credit cards. By doing that, you don't make a want into a must-have and thus keep your financial house in order.Step Five: To Build Your Future, Pay Off Your PastSo, now that you've maneuvered your \\"must-haves\\" to roughly 50%, your savings to 20%, and your discretionary spending to about 30%, it's time to look at eliminating your debt. That money comes from the 20% savings portion of your monthly budget - as long as you have significant debt, you should use this 20% to eliminate it in the form of extra payments beyond the \\"must-have\\" minimum payments. In fact, All Your Worth actually suggests reducing your savings down to $1,000 to focus on paying off debts (obviously, don't cash in anything that has a significant tax penalty). Once you've got those debts paid off, though, it's time to move onto the final step.Step Six: Build Your Dreams a Little at a TimeOnce you're debt free and have your spending in order, the fun begins to happen. You're now in a position to start socking away 20% of your money. The chapter offers some investment advice, but quite honestly, when you reach this point, you really should pick up a well-written investment book like The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing (read my full review of the book).Powerful ToolsThe second half of the book focuses on three specific topics: relationships and money, buying a home, and planning for emergencies.Love and Money: Having It AllThis is basically a one-chapter compression of David Bach's Smart Couples Finish Rich (read my full review) in that it focuses on many of the rough spots of mixing relationships and money. Most of the time, it comes down to communication, as do most sticky relationship issues.The Big Buy: Purchasing the Home That Is Right for YouThis was a very interesting chapter, because it's one of the few personal finance books I've ever seen that doesn't simply insist that you buy a home as soon as you have that down payment in hand. Basically, the book's advice is that you should live in the cheapest place that's acceptable to you whether it's renting or not in order to minimize that piece of your 50% must-haves, but that if you're renting, you should be saving at least some of the 20% savings for a down payment on a home.Financial CPR: Protect Yourself When Things Get ToughThe final chapter is one of the most important ones in the book: how do you handle an unmitigated financial disaster, such as a life-threatening illness or the loss of primary employment? A ton of good suggestions are offered here, the best one being know at all times what wants you could cut and even what must-haves you could cut and review that list regularly. There's also suggestions on progressively worse situations: talk to and negotiate with your creditors and, if all else fails, consider bankruptcy. This section is handled with great care and maturity and was one of the real highlights of the book for me.Buy or Don't Buy?I enjoyed the book quite a bit: it was very realistic and down-to-earth without feeling overly simplistic, either, which makes it appealing to a lot of readers. Buy this book if you're looking for a financial plan that doesn't demand that you cut things to the bone or consider major lifestyle changes.On the other hand, the fact that this book doesn't really go over re-evaluating your true relationship with money in your life is also a weakness, and that's why I would really recommend reading All Your Worth as a follow-up to the excellent \\"Your Money or Your Life.\\" Why? All Your Worth is a very, very good book if you already understand the role that money plays in your life, as it provides some guidelines for getting everything together. Your Money or Your Life, on the other hand, focuses on defining and understanding your relationship with money.I really enjoyed this book and see the power of the information inside of it, but I do worry that it's something like a diet book: it's really easy to fall off the horse unless you've made that key mental commitment first."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This book has placed before me a plan that I can stick to. Along with Suze Orman's The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke, I'm slowly getting my life in order. Warren and Tyagi gave me \\"permission\\" to keep 30% of my check for me, for whatever I want. That makes all the difference in the world. I'd look at my credit card balances and think that I couldn't keep that much of my check, I needed to pay them off. But I'd hold off, thinking \\"what if\\" thoughts. What if my car blows a tire, what if my dog has to go to the vet . . . and then by the end of the month, the extra few hundred was gone because I'd see it in the bank and think, well $30 here and $20 there, I'm not spending much. But I was. Their method gave me enough money so that I didn't feel broke, but left enough in the account to pay my bills and give a good extra chunk to the credit card demons. Yes, it's common sense stuff, as one reviewer put it, but most people do not use common sense with their money. Why else would the average credit card debt in the USA be around $8000 per household? With credit cards and mortgage companies giving you more credit than you can handle, it's no wonder we think we have more money than we really do.But, I digress. This book has good, solid advice for those, like me, who can't seem to make their debts smaller and their savings larger. Some of us need a plan. And now my card balances are shrinking. I'm estimating that in a year and a half I can start contributing to my very own Roth IRA. Maybe even invest in some mutual funds. Between this book and Orman's, I'm using lingo that I'd only ever wondered at before.So, if you want to make sure that all the bills get paid every month and that you still have money for movies and outings and silly things you love, get this book. If you need a guide to investing and prioritizing, get Orman's book. Heck, get them both. They are WORTH it."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I've been reading about two books about financingI've read probably over a dozen finance books and this one is my favorite without a doubt. The book breaks down 50% on must haves, 30% on wants/fun stuff, and 20% on savings/future. The majority of books I've read were about a certain subject like mutual funds, real estate or some motivational book, but this book really has a plan. Years ago they said to save 10%, because pension plans weren't being cut and social security wasn't a mess, but now every financial expert I know says save 20%. The problem is that we really don't know how much we can afford, most people will say I have X amount of dollars in the bank I can afford a new car, a bigger house, but at what expense.The great thing about this book is that for you to enjoy your quality of life you have to have some spending money on fun stuff (30%). The problem is that the majority of people either spend money on must haves or fun stuff, personally after doing my calculations on excel and savings it for future reference I noticed that my must haves were really too high, which will either take away from my savings or my fun money, which it took away from both. The balance of this formula is great, it shows that if you are too high in the must haves that you won't save as much for the future or you won't have enough money to go out and enjoy life. If you spend too much on going out you won't have the money for must haves like a house that you own. The balance formula is a great formula and it really makes sense and it's going to take me some time to get on a better formula, but at least I know what's lacking and what's taking up my time.The section save the dollars not the pennies is a great section and it explains that you should look at big things like the must haves that are killing the funds and then small stuff, most people look at small stuff first. I'll tell you from reading that section I'm saving over 215 dollars a year on life insurance and 200 dollars on home insurance a year. 415 dollars a year savings might not be that much, but it's a lot to me when my qualify of life hasn't change what so ever. As a matter of fact I think I have better insurance coverage now with a better company.I cannot say enough good things about this book and not just that the authors are awesome. I emailed Elizabeth Warren with a few questions about the book that I wasn't 100% sure about and she replied to my email right away. This is a person that's not just trying to get rich off a book, but really enjoys educating people. I haven't read the book the two parent income trap that they first published, but I'll tell you after reading this book it's without a doubt going to be one of the next books on my list."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This is one of the most useful books I've ever read. This book is not about high finances. There may be many small details that you may disagree about but that is not the point of this book. The great thing about All Your Worth is that it changes how you THINK about money. It offers ways out from your \\"negative thinking traps\\" that are the real reason why you have gotten into money troubles in the first place. And in addition, this book gives a simple fool-proof formula that you can follow. You can stop worrying about \\"am I saving enough for the future\\", \\"am I spending too much money on clothes\\" and \\"am I paying too much for my house\\". This book will give you clear answers for those questions. There are countless practical tips that have come very useful in our household. After reading All Your Worth and doing the excercises I finally feel in control of my money for the first time in my life (I'm 32). Even if you don't live in the U.S., most of the advice in this book is still valid although if you live in the Nordic countries like I do then the section about health insurance is not accurate. Still, a vast majority about the advice is universally applicable. Language will not be a problem either, it's written in simple language so you don't have to be a native English speaking person to understand it."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"Authors Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School's faculty and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi, a Wharton School of Business graduate, veer away from the usual save-your-pennies, clip-your-coupons genre of financial advice. They are less interested in teaching you how to pinch pennies than in showing you insightful ways to reclaim your life from your creditors and establish a sense of financial well-being. In fact, they warn that penny-pinching can be a dangerous distraction. The solution to out-of-control debt, they say, is a balanced approach, which begins by trimming the big-ticket budget busters that are devouring your income. The authors go beyond soft anecdotes and generalities to delineate specific tactics for plugging the holes in your finances, supported by diagnostic tests for readers. Occasionally their writing style is awkward - such as when they relate first-person anecdotes by specifying in parentheses which author is telling the story - but the book is otherwise lucid. The content reflects extensive, resourceful research. Best of all, the authors are realistic and don't promise any quick fixes. We strongly recommend this volume to anyone who needs financial guidance - and considering that U.S. banks alone will earn more than $100 billion this year in credit card interest, fees and other charges, that should include plenty of readers."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"There's a lot of great information in this book geared toward twenty-somethings and the pitfalls of student loans and low interest credit cards. As a parent of a kid who is just five years away from starting college I found the information very valuable. It seems that investigating student loans and financial assistance is going to be every bit as an important decision as which college to attend.The best advice books come down to common sense. Things and methods that are often so obvious that they are overlooked. Despite what it says there are some quick-fixes but those quick-fixes don't have to be only short-term fixes. This book is not all about paying your bills and saving for the future. The Warrens know how very important it is to have \\"fun money\\" to use for entertainment and their guide helps you plan not only for savings, but also to have that money to go out to eat, or buy DVD's, etc. In it's simplest form \\"All Your Worth\\" is about categorizing things into things that are \\"must haves\\" like your bills, and things that you \\"Want\\" say for fun.This book isn't one of those that you need to make a lot of money in order to be useful. This book is about taking your current financial situation and turning it around to your advantage and escaping your debts...ESPECIALLY credit card debts. This is real advice for real, hard-wroking, middle-class people."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I purchased the audiobook version of this title, and will review that version. Content-wise, it's great. The authors have a simple, no-nonsense approach that gets you on a path to financial well-being without clipping coupons obsessively or bringing a bag lunch to work (if that's not your thing). In short, it's a budgeting program that doesn't have the feel of a punishment (like so many budgeting programs do). I've already recommended this book to three or four people, and I've passed it on to loved ones. It's really that good. If you're not in completely dire straits (i.e. bankruptcy), the latter half of the book probably doesn't apply to you, but the basic stuff (the first half of the book) is worth the price in and of itself.Now as for the actual *recording,* if I have one criticism, it's this. See... this book is read by the authors, and being from the Midwest (I think), they have a folksy, at times corny way of phrasing things. Sometimes, it's endearing, and sometimes, it's annoying... but the content is so good that not even the folksiest of recordings could mess it up. Oh... and one other thing... one of the audio CDs has a big PDF file (set of worksheets) on it that's foolproof and rather helpful.If you're a financial layperson - whether you're in terrible financial shape, or you're really not so bad - give this book a shot. It's dirt cheap, is a quick listen, and even if you don't have the patience to get through the whole thing, the first half will give you some good lessons."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I know this is super corny but this book has changed my life too. I loved the balanced money formula they give and its very easy to stick to. I love the worksheets because unlike a lot of other financial books, each chapter or each step that they cover has a worksheet for you to understand where you are financially, where you need to be and what you're doing wrong. Then it provides great tips on how to get to where you need to be.I think this book is best for literally anyone. I don't have any debt and I don't have a lot of expenses but I learned so much about a little bit of everything that I feel more prepared for the day when I need a mortgage. I happened to fall upon this book in the book store, bought it and couldn't put it down. All in all, its a must read if you're struggling financially."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I went looking for this book for my 13 year old nephew. The book is an easy read, and it pulls no punches. They describe it as a plan for life, versus a crash diet. The authors make a point of identifying the psychological and emotional traps people spring on themselves that prevent them from getting a handle on their finances. It also makes it easy for people to keep track of their money without writing down every single expense. Their approach is so simple it is a wonder I have never heard of it before. In a nutshell it splits your take home pay into three piles. 50% for Must-Haves, 20% for Savings and 30% for Wants. Since the Must-Haves are recurring large expenses they are easy to track. The Savings is easy to track because people do not have many savings accounts at one time. The remainder is for wants, and if you use cash you know how much you have to spend on wants by simply opening your wallet and counting the money. I know several adults that never got their financial house in order because they could not be bothered to write things down, well here is the solution, and another excuse bites the dust.This book and a subscription to Consumer Reports are a must for anyone that wants to manage their money without spending their life managing their money."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"All Your Worth is the best money management plan I've read -- and I've read a lot of them!

We live in a high cost of living city where we both have great jobs but also had a lot of debt. Thanks to the Warren's my husband is debt free and I am two months from paying off all of my school debt and being debt free. We our contributing to our retirement funds, finally have an adequate emergency savings account and were able to pay $6,000 of out of pocket dental expenses last year without the credit card. How did we do it? The 50% \\"must haves\\" was the biggest part, specifically we held off on buying a house in the city. We found an awesome mother-in-law rental that only eats up 12% of our combined take-home pay. Because we rent, we can afford to live in a very nice neighborhood - our neighbor (who albeit probably paid too much on his single family home) has a mortgage payment that is over 4x our rent payment!We decided that paying off our debt was a more important goal for us than getting a mortgage at this time. Now if you live in a lower cost of living place, this specific goal may not be the best for you, so no need to comment on how we're \\"throwing our money away on rent.\\" Regardless of your specific financial goals, this book outlines a great financial plan and financial risk assessment tool. I think it has worked for us because it's simple, it focuses on the big expenses instead of the tiny ones (e.g. morning espresso), and no nagging or surveillance of spouses is needed."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I read this book at a friend's house - in one sitting.

We are two working parents of a 3-yr old living in expensive Silicon Valley. We both make decent money, but we have a very high mortgage and property taxes. This is a reality if you own a house in this area. This put our \\"Must Haves\\" well over the recommended 50% of our income. Even making some of the recommended changes, we still would be above the mark.This is a good book for setting important goals for getting your money in order, and for gaining some focus on what needs to be done. It just doesn't work in some areas of the country unless you have a reasonably high income.We will pay down our mortgage to see if we can apply the formulas at a different time."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This book has a couple of really good ideas, but overall I was disappointed. The 50/30/20 rule was the most useful idea in the book. Some things I absolutely do not agree with - like keeping a $1000.00 emergency fund in your regular \\"Must-Haves\\" checking account. That's a disaster waiting to happen. Let's face it -- if you're reading the book, financial discipline is probably not your finest quality. If that money is that available, it's TOO available.The basic premise of the book is good, however, and bit more nitty-gritty than most books on the same subject. Many such books are written for those who already have some funds to play with - this one is to help you get to where you have those funds. With the exception of a few ideas that seem out of step with the overall concepts, the book is worth a read."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"This is a book for thosw with minimal knowledge about personal finance; consequently, the author's (mother and daughter) guarantee that \\"this book is diferent\\" and \\"We guarantee this will transform your finaces...\\" falls short.The model is simplistic, i.e., allocate 50% for the essentials (they call it MUST HAVES), 20% for savings, and 30% for discretionary items (they call it WANTS). However, the author's spin a crass blunder: the savings portion includes, according to them, any contributions from your employer to a tax deferred account (i.e., 401(k) or similar concept), and the reader is instructed to calculate this portion of the savings ratio from AFTER TAX INCOME. Now, we all know that any contributions to tax deferred accounts such as 401(k)s are not taxed, so the ratio is inflated and the 50-20-30 will not add up to 100. For example, assume a reader makes $100,000, is 51 years old, and contributes the maximum to his 401(k), which is matched at 4% by his employer. His adjusted gross income is $82,000 (i.e., $100,000 minus $14,000 maximum contribution AND $4,000 catch-up contribution). If he saved nothing else, his actual savings ratio is 18% ($18,000 divided by $100,000), but the author's approach would yield a larger (and inaccurate) ratio - $18,000 plus $4,000 from his employer = $22,000, which is 26.83% (i.e., $22,000 divided by $82,000). So this individual, according to the authors, is above the recommended 20% savings ratio when in fact he is 2% below the 20%.The authors address \\"The Truth About Debt\\" and tell us that credit cards are a dangerous tool - this is true for some, perhaps many. Unfortunately, Elizabeth Warren does not tell us the story of how the credit card industry has become such a nefarious business - and she wouldn't have to include it in her book were it not for the fact that she was interviewed for a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) program about this very subject. Why not add one more page to an already bloated book and tell us that when Citi Bank's credit card division was about to go under the state of South Dakota did us all such a favor by allowing the New York based operation to incorporate in South Dakota and EXPORT an obscure and arcane loophole from case law that would basically do away with usery laws. In South Dakota Citi Bank could charge whatever interest rate they wanted for debt, but more importantly, they could export that model to any other state - this is when rates of 14%, 22%, and now 29% and even 34% for revolving credit are the norm, and perfectly legal. For someone that teaches contract law at Harvard it becomes an obligation to educate the public and not sweep these germane facts under the carpet.The book is superficial, simplistic, and fails to cover investments (other than recommending index funds after telling you to buy individual stocks - William Bernstein would be confused). It provides a good introduction for those with no experience in personal finance or investing, but by no means is it sufficient - even for the neophyte, and that's the biggest danger. I recommend you go to your local library to check out the book before buying it."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"The 50/30/20 rule makes a good amount of sense. It gives people a percentage that helps people balance their life. I like the advice of getting rid of credit card debt as well as facing bankruptcy. Two recommendations I don't like: buying index funds and paying off the mortgage.Buying index funds comes with 2 drawbacks: mediocrity and a requirement of owning the \\"worst\\" stocks. If the manager of a regular mutual fund thinks that the stock stinks he/she can dump it but if he/she manages an index fund, he/she cannot get rid of it.At today's rates, paying off the mortgage makes no sense. The extra money that can go to principal is better off being in an investment such as a mutual fund. It is highly likely that you can find mutual funds that pay a higher rate of return than what the mortgage is costing you. If your mortgage rate is 7% and you can earn a long term average rate of return of 10% (stock mutual funds return that rate), what is the point of paying down your mortgage? Besides, I know of only 2 tax breaks available to the majority of Americans: retirement plan contributions and mortgage interest. Thus, mortgages are good debt as opposed to credit cards which is bad debt."},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","review":"I read through this book in one day and faithfully filled out the worksheets. It did seem that at last I had found a fairly simple, flexible plan that our family could easily follow. It was only after mulling over the Wants vs Must Haves that I realized there is a flaw in the authors' logic (unless in my fast read I missed a crucial step).The authors define Must Haves (which should take no more than 50% of your after-tax income) as bills that you would have to pay even if you lost your job and became disabled. These include mortgage, insurance, medical bills, groceries & a couple of other narrowly defined categories. After you pay these Must Haves and save 20% of your income you're supposed to be left with 30% of your income to \\"play\\" with for your Wants, worry-free.I started thinking about our real life expenses though and realized that if we lost our jobs would we stop buying light bulbs & just sit in the dark as they burned out one by one? Would we stop buying toilet paper & raid our neighbors' recyclying bins for newspaper? Would we drop off our beloved 12-yr old family dog at the Humane Society when we ran out of dog food?No to all of that so where are those expenses supposed to come from? Somehow the thrill of spending my carefree 30% diminishes when I have to spend it on toothpaste and toilet paper. While there is some discretion in these types of items (we could go to the Dollar Store for many of the items)the real world cost of these really mounts up. For instance, if my husband lost his job I think his job prospects would look pretty dim if he stopped shaving or using deodorant.So this realization really deflated my excitement about this book. I still think there's sound advice to be found in it and I think breaking your budget into broad categories by percentages is a great idea. I just think that maybe the authors' plan is a little too simple and following it to the letter might cause a problem"},{"Title":"Diaries of a Young Poet","review":"Every time I pick up anything by Rilke I am astounded.I read these works and think, \\"This is a diary? What if people, years from now published my morning pages notebooks? Hardly the beauty found here.\\"AND yet in Rilke's words, I find an appreciation not only for him, for his art, for the people who populated his life experience - I also find an extreme appreciation for the connection we all share.What is exceptionally invigorating about these Diaries is their wide variety of creative expression. There are poems - there are pieces of short fiction - there is a sort of travel narrative and art criticism.Unlike another reader, I found it highly personal.... Like stepping into the pages of anyone's diary is highly personal.I found myself singing songs of gratitude for the fact his diaries were saved so that we could enjoy them today, more than one hundred years later.Ironic and perfect, given that final appraisal by me, to hear this one quote from this book which really sums up Rilke's reflection of life from his pen - \\"Whoever understands and honors Death grants Life greatness.\\""},{"Title":"Diaries of a Young Poet","review":"I'm just starting to explore Rilke...this book is wonderful for understanding where he is coming from in his poetry.

I force myself to read slowly and drink it in...it is worth it! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Diaries of a Young Poet","review":"I love Rilke, and I bought this expecting something similar to his &quot;Letters to a young poet.&quot; However, this book seems less personal- it contains much more of Rilke's reflections on Italian art, in Florence, and on the art of the people around him in Germany. It is perhaps more engaging to someone who knows a great deal about the art he is discussing! There are still wonderful, wonderful Rilke moments, but this may not be the best book for non-artists or for people discovering Rilke for the first time."},{"Title":"Diaries of a Young Poet","review":"If you enjoy his poetry you will enjoy this: his thinking process liberated from poetic form, but touched by the same genius."},{"Title":"E-Male: Of Mouse and Men","review":"I have been taking this book with me everywhere I go, so I can dip into it for a refreshing break.

Occasionally there is a humorous or touching entry. Most of the entries are banal, repetitive, clich&eacute; ridden, trite and lackluster. Rehashes of three year old hockey games and put downs of famous popular singers and musicians from the past decade or two are unfortunately the norm. Each letter ends with a slightly modified line about what RULES!!! that day.If you are even tempted to read this dreadful book, just reread your own email instead, you'll find it much better than this book."},{"Title":"E-Male: Of Mouse and Men","review":"I found this book to one of the most entertaining pieces I have ever read!

I read the book cover to cover - unable to separate myself from it until its conclusion.Rarely have I been so amused and touched by such fresh,honest,direct,unique yet eerily familiar voices. While I grew up in a completely different world from Anthony and Jeff -- I felt an instant connection. This book is a timeless anthem to the Generation &quot;X&quot; pilgrims.While the book is remarkably clever and hilarious at times -- the unwavering focus on the men's friendship and lives remains brilliantly subtle -- and these delicate layers of friendship, marriage,career and maturity must be properly appreciated or the essence of the book is utterly lost.

While being laugh-out-loud funny, the e-mails also reveal a very close, intimate and touching story of male friendship. E-Male is both a fun and interesting read for men and women. You will pick up this book and re-read it from time to time for many good laughs. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"E-Male: Of Mouse and Men","review":"The concept of reading a book of email between two friends may seem dry, but there's actually a plot hidden in this: becoming a grown-up thirtysomething, with marriage, life, etc. impending, that sort of sneaks up on you in the end. I rather think that future anthropologists may read this a hundred years from now when they want to find out what it was like at the dawn of the email era, or at least twenty years from now we can re-read it to remember what the 90s were like.

Having shared the same apartment in the past, two best friends now find themselves states apart. They correspond though witty and honest daily e-mails invoking humorous past incidents and funny narratives. Most of the e-mails are about their horrendous jobs or their acclamation to married life. Most of them are fun and provide a good glimpse into the lives of these two down to earth people. All of the e-mails end with what \\"rules\\" and what \\"sucks\\" on that particular day, which is often humorous. My only complaint would be the somewhat repetitive nature of their e-mails. All told, it is a fun read."},{"Title":"E-Male: Of Mouse and Men","review":"I was hesitant at first to read a book about males only, however it so insiteful.

You will laugh, cry, and be totally engrossed!"},{"Title":"E-Male: Of Mouse and Men","review":"I read a review in a magazine touting this book and decided to buy it (from Amazon.com, BTW). I enjoyed E-Male so much because it reminded me of the fun I've been having keeping touch through this new medium -- and the e-mails between these author-friends were frighteningly like the ones that fly across the ethos between me and my dear amiga.

The story is a straight-forward, easily understood retelling of the story of how King Arthur came to possess the sword Excalibur. What makes this book unique are the illustrations.

This is the world of Arthur as I have always imagined it to be: mysterious places, beautiful people, uniquely detailed settings and creatures. A wonderful book to share with a child."},{"Title":"Excalibur","review":"Whosoever pulleth out the sword from the stone and anvil is king of all England by right of birth.

I found this text to be deeply insightful. As one who has recently become interested in the work and life of Ana Mendieta, I found this book to be much more than an introduction to the &quot;earth/body&quot;-oriented artist, but a document helpful enough for in depth study. The photos, however, are black and white, and scarce. If it's a full color collection of Ana Mendieta's work you are in search of, this is not the text you want. However, if you are looking for a deeply fascinating, clearly well educated and researched text documenting this fine artist, you've found your match."},{"Title":"Where Is Ana Mendieta?: Identity, Performativity, and Exile","review":"This book remains the most important text for anyone with a serious interest in Mendieta's work.

It is against this book that others should be judged. If you are interested in Amateur Telescope Making you should buy it (and probably at least Vol.2 and maybe Vol.3). In my opinion this is one of those books that really deserves 6 stars."},{"Title":"Amateur Telescope Making (Book One)","review":"What a great book! I decided to make my own scope, and so I bought this book, ground and polished a piece of glass, and I had a telescope! This book has one problem. It can get too technical at times. This can be desirable, but not when you are dealing with beginners.If this book was revised to be simpler, I am sure it would be the choice book for amateurs.--Matt Hanson"},{"Title":"Amateur Telescope Making (Book One)","review":"This book was written in the first half of the 20th Century, as one of three related volumes. In 1996, publisher Willmann-Bell rearranged the hodge-podge collection of articles, into a more logically arranged edition, also of three volumes. This first volume deals exclusively with: Newtonian Mirror Making, Optical Testing, Workshop Wisdom and Observatory Buildings.Together, these stand-alone articles detail the thoughts, methods and techniques of that bygone era. A modern reader might find such practices \\"primative\\" these days, but one must remember that using the simplest of tools and measurements, ordinary (non-technical) folk were able to produce some excellent optics.Still, this should no longer be considered a beginner's book of telescope making. Though the general concepts and principles remain, the actual materials, fabrication techniques and measurement methods have greatly improved, or at least no longer apply to the text. Instead, this book should be considered as a resource for ATM's with some actual experience, and who might have the historical or technical curiosity to see how others accomplished marvels a century before, without the benefit of personal computers, light emitting diodes, or off-the-shelf telescope hardware."},{"Title":"Amateur Telescope Making (Book One)","review":"I also started making my own telescope in 1968 and wanted to use the most complete book on the subject (and so I chose ATM because it was promoted by Scientific American). I later realized that it was too technical, difficult to understand, and much of it was OUTDATED ALREADY IN 1968. They just keep printing it because it still sells. And it still sells because people still ignorantly think that if it has Scientific American's endorsement, it must be the best (just like I thought).If you are a beginner, don't waste your money on this...If you are a pro at telescope making, then you may benefit from ATM, but that's about it.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"Amateur Telescope Making (Book One)","review":"Amateur Telescope Making Book Three published by Scientific American and edited by Ingalls is the last in a series of three books devoted to the science of telescope making. Published in 1953, It is fascinating, but severely dated.This work is a compilation of articles on such varied topics as High Vacuum equipment and spectroscopy. While dated, It nevertheless contains much worthwhile information and would be a welcome addition to any collection on the topic.My favorite chapter is the Editors Chapter at the end of the book. It contains biographical information on most of the regular contributiors.This book should not be confused with an authoritative treatise on modern methods of optical fabrication, but as a history leading to how we got to where we are today.Francis J.

There were a lot interesting tidbits but you had to mine for them thru a hodge podge of material that Ingalls thrown together (he even stated that books one and two he edited were in no particular order). But much of the information in these books was already obsolete by the time I made my first mirrors in 1968. There is much talk in the original books about using HCF &quot;honeycomb lap foundations&quot; as a quick (and inferior) polishing lap, making your own abrasives, making your own eyepieces and alike, that even 40 years had long since been abandoned. I even think these books discouraged as many people as they encouraged to make their own telescopes, a point of view I share with the great John Dobson There are far better, easier to understand books available today such as &quot;Build your own Telescope&quot; by Richard Berry, &quot;Making Your Own Telescope&quot; by Allen Thompson (written about the same time as the ATM books but far easier to follow), and of course the classic &quot;How to Make a Telescope&quot; by Jean Texereau. I have reviewed the the new editions reedited and reorganised by Willmann-Bell, and while they are a valiant attempt to resurect these tombs, what I found was a lot of the tidbits to be found in the later (post 1950) editions were gone. I would advise the novice if you've really gotten the bug to build a scope of your own from the primary mirror up, to get a hold of one or better yet of the all books I've listed above before you invest in the new edition of the ATM books. If your still interested in seeing what was in the original books try the used book sites on the web. There are still a number of them out there at reasonable prices from checking myself before I wrote this review. They are interesting to look thru to see what techniques and materials use to be used, but I would not want to make my first telescope again from them."},{"Title":"Sirens","review":"My favorite collection of Chris Achilleos' work borrows the title from the painting on the cover titled &quot;A siren's remorse&quot;. This image of a siren (mythological creature similar to a mermaid that uses it's voice to lure sailors to their death) cradling the bloated body of dead sailor depicts the agony and frustration of this beautiful creature as it struggles to fight back the tears. This book depicts fantastic struggles and quiet moments of beauty with such artistry and flair, that it leaves the viewer spellbound. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Sirens","review":"\\"[Achilleos] was suspicious of Fine Art from the beginning, and still is.\\" I can appreciate that. As an illustrator rather than artist (or Artiste), Achilleos is free to tell an exciting story, capture a dramatic moment, revel in a woman's bare beauty, or even get a little silly - sometimes all at once. These works, largely from the late 70s and early 80s, present a variety of Achilleos's commissions and portfolio pieces, along with comments that narrate his life during this time.It's wonderful and varied work, including Star Trek, Dr. Who, Bladerunner, and other well-known cultural icons. The best work melds Achilleos's strong pinup style with fantasy and science fiction elements, in varying proportions. I was especially interested in Achilleos's notes on technique. He trained as a commercial illustrator with deadlines to meet, so feels free to use anything that does the job and does it on time: gouache, oils, airbrush, ink, even fabric dye. Well, a picture done for reproduction has different goals that one meant as an end product in itself - if it looks good in print, it must have been right.Although Achilleos might not be well known to most people, he commands respect within the world of fantasy imagery. A glowing intro by Ray Harryhausen compares Achilleos to Boris and Frazetta - I might not elevate Achilleos to those ranks, but his art is easy to enjoy anyway. This book fits comfortably into any collection of fantasy art.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Sirens","review":"I have a few favorite artists who do amazing illustrations and Achilleos is one of them.This book is a huge collection, most of beautiful women, and its their costumes and surroundings that make them exotic. Achilleos is one of those kind and fatastic people who inspire other people do follow up with their art. I have written him a fan letter and he personally wrote back. It makes it so much more wonderful to appreciate his art when he is so warm and gracious.This album covers many genres and interests. There are dragons, warriors, horses, mermaids, zombies, superheros, lizards, animals, robots, evil creatures and just about everything else you can think of, captured on a glossy page.This book gives me tons of pleasure simply by sitting on my shelf. I know I have a piece of his art, and at hands reach I am transported to his insanely beautiful world.Tremendous collectible for ANYONE!"},{"Title":"Sirens","review":"From a past master of fantasy we turn our attentions to one of the modern masters, Chris Achilleos. Originally published in 1986, Sirens is back in print courtesy of Titan Books and features 128 pages in full-color. Achilleos has produced work for many different venues over the years from covers to books and gaming materials to film posters and album covers.As the title suggests, Sirens includes many examples of Achilleos' ladies, including Miss America, Birth of a Vampire, and the warrior-queen Boadicea. It was Achilleos' who provided the legendary painting of Taarna for the animated film, Heavy Metal. He also did posters for Grease Two, Supergirl, and Blade Runner. He also is a noted pin-up artist and many examples of his sexy and erotic art are included as well.I always like when an art collection book provides the medium in which the artist worked for each piece of art included and thankfully, Titan doesn't disappoint with details provided for each illustration. About the only negative I can find is that it would have been nice to include some revised and current info rather than a straight re-printing of Sirens, but it's still a great collection and great to have in print again."},{"Title":"Sirens","review":"Art books are always a challenge to both produce, and write about. Having produced a volume on Joe Sinnott, I am keenly aware of the fine line between bragging and biography, hopefully having biographed instead. Fine art books can either be a collection of standout art pieces with a little narrative, or more narrative, and less art. \\"Sirens\\" walks the fine line and is well balanced.If you want insight into Mr Achilleos, there is insight. If you want to see the beautiful pieces of work that his pencil, pen and brush have created, there is that too. Many pieces stand out as you peruse the high quality production. This book highlights his science fiction/fantasy pieces with particular focus on Dr Who, and his Star Trek renditions (for me at least). There are many excellent Viking pieces too for the Norse art lover in all of us. He really shines, where his sister states he could not draw well at all, in his renditions of female figures. Boadicia adorns the cover spectacularly, while Elric completes the dust jacket. Inside, his commission pieces depict stunningly beautiful women in a variety of genres. Two of his pieces top my list as favourites, Miss America, and Cheyenne. Just so we are clear, the rest of the book is packed with amazing art no matter where you look.Chapterwise, the book covers the following: A Biographical Introduction, Dr Who and Star Trek, Fantasy and Science Fiction, Amazons, film work, fighting fantasy and pin ups. The text by Nigel Suckling is intriguing, like a tour guide taking you through a montage of Achilleos artwork. Just to nitpick a little, Startrek, should be Star Trek.Wander a while through the Imaginative worlds of Chris Achilleos, and marvel at the 2nd edition of Titan Books landmark presentation. Hold your applause.Tim Lasiuta"},{"Title":"Sirens","review":"What an artist, what work!! Really if you are into fantasy/sci-fi illustrations, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"PrairyErth entered my library because Blue Highways was there. I had read Blue Highways four times when I discovered PrairyErth and bought it. At first I was bitterly disappointed that it wasn't much like Blue Highways. And it had all those quotations at the beginning of each chapter. But as I forced myself to pick up the book and read it, over time, I realized I had to force myself to set it back down again. I lived with the author during every one of his encounters with the locals and found in my memories someone almost like each one of them. His search for Og paralleled my own search for a farm where I lived for only two years while I was seven and eight years old--a place that provided me with a beginning, a young boy's paradise. When I finally found the farm it had been turned into a gravel pit, a super highway and it was so reduced in size it amounted to little more that what remained of William Least Heat-Moon's Og. And it was just as difficult to find. Any author that can bring a reader into his story and share his thoughts with him has accomplished what he set out to do. I lived with William Least Heat-Moon every step he took while walking over the prairie in Kansas. And I shared with him the joys of discovery. Truly a great book."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"If you're not from Kansas, or have never stepped through prairie, you might be tempted not to tackle reading the lengthy PrairyErth. That would be too bad. Least Heat-Moon's description of Chase County prairie, it's people and history, and it's importance to America is fine reading. Clearly he has invested in this book years of research and soul. As vital to American fabric as Yosemite or the Grand Canyon, this tough prairie deserves the time it will take to understand it through this book."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"This was a wonderful read although it was never easy. It inspires me to do a \\"deep map\\" of Otsego county in NYS."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"A very deep map indeed, the second of Heat-Moon's three literary tours-de-force is the story of a county in Kansas. In his first excursion, the best-selling BLUE HIGHWAYS, the author reported on a ten thousand mile sojourn along the old Federal Highways (blue on most maps). PRAIRYERTH grew out of three years of hiking, conversation and archival research in Chase County, Kansas and the result is a living history of both the particular locale and the European invasion of the west. From Knute Rockne's death in a commercial plane crash to Sam Wood's murder to Native medicine, dream walking to newspaper accounts of life on the prairie, and fossils to legends to The Land Institute where Wes Jackson explores the looming demise of the liquid fuel era, this volume casts a wide net. Heat-Moon is clear eyed enough to see the facts and then see beyond the facts to the life between the lines of old courthouse documents and pioneer diaries. He is open to less tangible subtlety as well, admitting susceptibility to hunch, daydream or the message from another's Ouija board. He tells a tale of hawks, buffalo, cowboys and beef, notes the profound damage wrought on the American prairie by McBurger mania and the possibility of recovery in a place of vast flatness and endless wind and sky. He lunches with the dead in old cemeteries and stakes out to observe life in a dying town where nothing happens. There are midnight moonlight hikes and journalistic experiments, pertinent quotes by the truckload and poignant still lifes of moments of love and loss. Such a deep map makes for a long read, but well worth the effort as pieces click into place in later chapters and a pastiche emerges, a hologram in which you can walk between the hills and dip a cupful from a clear flowing spring."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I read this book while driving my family at night across Iowa. The audio cassette version was outstanding. With a captivating and varied writing style, Moon recreates a sense of place by recording infinite detail, wonderful biographies, and fascinating history. While my van rambled across the Iowa praries, I listened to this book and for 8 hours, I felt like I was in Chase County. The mark of a great writer is to recreate a sense of time, place, and locale--Moon has done it with this book."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Like many I bought this book based on WLHM's book Blue Highways. I have absolutely no interest in the history of Kansas or the midwest for that matter. Regardless, I found in Prairyerth a book with rich detail that saunters along through the recent, and sometimes ancient, history of one Kansas county. While reading Prairyerth, I looked forward to escaping into Chase County each evening; exploring it's buildings, talking with townfolk, and walking the vast prairy with Heat-Moon.What a great read and book that I'll be adding to my permenant collection."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Least Heat has done it again!

It is from the perspective of someone who is concerned about the natural world and the threats we already know about. I like the collage of quotations that appear throughout the book. Many of them are fearful, but others focus on prayer and praise. A satisfying balance."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"The author provides an in-depth depiction of a county in the great plains prior to and during the westward expansion years.

It is a surprisingly good read, yet something is missing. Perhaps I was expecting the touch of angst that he had in Blue Highways. In any event, he has used an interesting approach to describe an area in depth. Put this one next to Sand County Almanac."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"...so I figured I'd like PrairyErth, but I gotta agree with the other three-star reviewer. In fact, I confess I quit after a few chapters, so unfortunately I never met the feminist rancher or the last remaining Kaws, and it's a shame. In fact, I didn't meet a single human being, and if I recall correctly, didn't even meet an animal. I listened to L-H M staring at handfuls of soil and blades of grass. While I respect L-H M's writing and get his purpose, it was just plain too much contemplation and too little dialog, not to mention action.By the way, I'm also a native Kansan, and recall an enjoyable novel set in the Flint Hills called Firebird. Not a great work of literature, but well researched and I learned much more about the Flint Hills therefrom than I did from PrairyErth."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"As a native Kansan and writer myself, I appreciate the author's efforts to probe deeply into the heart, soul, and sod of my land, but sometimes you just want the guy to come up for air.

But maybe it will boost Flint Hills tourism among wandering intellectuals -- something I'm sure we locals will really appreciate!"},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I read this book based on loving Blue Highways and recognizing Least Heat-Moon as a beautiful writer. I never thought that I would be enthralled with one county in one state; yet, I was truly engrossed each page of this book about one county in Kansas. Least Heat-Moon has a way of touching the minute specifics of the history of our country and does it in such a way that you feel you are there sipping tea or a beer with the neighbor next door each step of the way across the county. A wonderful study of Americana history and while the length of the book is possibly intimidating to many, those of us who really appreciate excellent writing will smile our way across the county inch by inch and wish there were more!"},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Ignorant, I found PrairyErth at a book-giveaway and would now have to count it among the best books I've ever read. The book is a thorough examination of a county that (possibly) many people would assume contains nothing but prairie grass. The point is how deep a map can be drawn of even the neglected places. Heat-Moon is amazing and inspiring, covering so many bases without over-stepping any of them. I had never even heard of Chase County but now I feel as though its every acre has been tattooed on my inner eyelids. Oh, and also: read it slow and steady. Pace yourself as Heat-Moon has.."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I have just spent 2 days exploring Chase County, Kansas. I had read the book PrairyErth and found myself drawn to explore it for myself.Driving along I50, I rejoiced at crossing the Chase County border. I had fun exploring the Chase County courthouse, eating at the Emma Chase cafe and meeting folks that have met Heat Moon. Seeing the small towns of Matfield Green, Bazaar and Wonsevu were particularly interesting.The historical museum in Cottonwood Falls was a highlight for me, Pat, who is one of the volunteers there was extremly helpful and I found everyone I met and spoke too in Chase County as well as the whole of Kansas, a joy to meet and talk too.I plan to read the book PrairyErth again and relive my 2 days spent in Chase County. I congratulate you Bill on a great book that placed in my soul a want to travel and discover Kansas for myself."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I read this book on a sun-drenched beach on the island of Raratonga, Cook Islands. I would recommend Raratonga to anyone seeking a paradise in which to relax. More highly recommended, however, is PrairyErth, which transported me with alarming ease from this lush, tropical eden to the limitless view of a Kansas prairie. PrairyErth is indeed a &quot;Deep Map&quot; and the tale it tells of a state, which can be synonymous with ennui, is remarkable. This book is a phenomenal achievement and one that should be read by every lover of books extant. It is a historical, philosophical, geographical, and geological masterpiece and renders the state of Kansas much brighter on any reader's radar screen."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Imagine my surprise to find a book by a major author about the county in Kansas where our family ranch is and in which both my parents grew up.Let me tell you this much: Heat-Moon portrays this land and its people accurately. The level of detail is sufficiently great that some people with only passing interest or shorter attention spans will find it too much, but by my lights he did what he set out to do.This book is a good way to understand the Midwest and we, its people. It demonstrates clearly what I've been saying for years: that those who drive through Kansas only at night on freeways at 80 mph should please keep driving--that way its unique character can be spared for those of us who appreciate it.Furthermore, the author is a pleasant man, whom (by ridiculous coincidence) I happened to encounter at a Greek restaurant in Seattle one day. He was approachable and gracious. It was nice to find that his real personality was not different from his self-portrayal in PrairyErth."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"While a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, I had to take a Senior Seminar to complete my BA in English. We studied PrairyErth for several weeks and it was well worth the time spent. Least Heat-Moon is a gifted writer, and PrairyErth has been my favorite book for 6 years now. I have recommended this book to several people who were able to appreciate its detail. One must savor this book, and take it slow. It is so rich and beautiful, with such a sense of place, that I will always equate this work with those sunny, dreamy days in college..."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I first picked up this book when a job change brought us into the Tallgrass Prairie region of Kansas. As it turns out, we settled in Cottonwood Falls, Chase County, Kansas! It was extraordinary to read PrairyErth, knowing that we would soon be experiencing this place first-hand.There is truly nothing like living in this community and experiencing the sights, places and people described so richly in PrairyErth. William Least Heat-Moon knows this place well, and paints a picture that is as vivid and timeless as Chase County itself. As a &quot;local&quot;, I've returned to this book time and time again.Unfortunately, my job is now taking us away from here. If you've read the passage about Spring Street in Cottonwood Falls, then you know our home. This is truly a beautiful and extraordinary place; unique in the world. If you would like to experience the sense of community that my family and I have been so blessed with, give me a call."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"New to William Least Heat Moon, I wasn\`t quite sure what to expect with Prairyerth. Having heard about the critical acclaim of Blue Highways, I thought a lesser known work would be the place to start. And I am glad I chose Praityerth.With Prairyearth, William Least Heat Moon has dug down to the heart of a specific place, in this case, the Flint Hill country of Chase County, Kansas. Not unlike Thoreau\`s Walden, Prairyerth is an exhaustive chronicle of one man\`s journey to the bottom--historically, geologically and geographically speaking--of one particular and rather insignificant place in the American landscape. Prairyerth, like Walden, is impossible to lump into one clean-cut literary category. Neither pure history, nor pure geology, nor \`storytelling\` per say, it is rather a brilliant concoction of all three. It is, as the author pens it, a \`deep map\` of one tiny piece of the New World. And deep it is. Least Heat Moon delves into every square inch, every prehistoric layer of his subject. The result is a stirring and fascinating ride through the discovery, settling, exploitation and ultimate destruction of the American prairie. Half Native American himself, Least Heat Moon walks through the tall grass of the American Sea with much the same spirit of his ancestors. Here was not emptiness as thought the first Europeans, but rather a vast ocean of endless natural wealth. Home to the once vast bison herds, the tall-grassed hills of Chase County were once giant mountains of the Kansas range that were slowly worn down into the Flint Hills of today. Least Heat Moon follows the tracks of the Osage and the Kansa, \`people of the wind,\` who traversed this area long before Zebulon Pike and John Fremont made their tentative forays across the prairie towards more secure landscapes. The author vividly captures the reverence that the Osage and Kansa held for the \`prairie.\` Tracking down the stories of the few remaining pure-blood Kansa, Least Heat Moon paints a metaphor for what looms in the future for us, lest we ignore the lessons of the past. Not only does the author richly expose the layer of Native Americana within Chase County, but he does justice to the natural elements of the place as well. Some of the most fascinating parts of Prairyerth are the sections on two of the county\`s most enduring denizens, the Osage Orange tree/bush and the Wood Rat, aka Pack/Trade Rat. Least Heat Moon has an ultra sharp eye for interesting detail and oddity and knows how to bring such things to life.The structure of the work is as ambitious as it is groundbreaking. Every other chapter covers another quadrant of the county. Least Heat Moon spends most of his time analyzing the present inhabitants of the county, trying to distill the essence of \`Kansasness.\` He chats with the weathered old farmers and ranchers who\`ve survived every tornado and flash flood over the last half-century and who entertain no thoughts on living anywhere else. Every voice in the county gets its chance. Feminist cattle ranchers give him the lowdown on castrating bulls, local high schoolers divulge their dreams and the regulars of the Emma Chase Cafe unload gossip unaware of who\`s writing it all down. Kansasness, according to the author, is a baffling mix of progressive politics and constrictive convention. A place of often violent contrasts. Kansas was the first state born out of the fires of abolition, first to stimulate integration (Board of Education vs Topeka), yet the \`n word\` is still commonplace all over the county. The forefather of the county, Samuel Wood, was one of the most eloquent voices among the abolitionists, yet he stopped short of pushing for full integration. Kansas was a place where all people had freedom of opportunity (especially to better oneself economically), as long as everybody kept to his/her own. One of the first states to allow women\`s suffrage, it was also one of the first to embrace Prohibition. It also kept its archaic and puritan sex laws on the books until the recent Supreme Court ruling overturned such laws.In between his quadrant explorations of the county, Least Heat Moon has interspersed chapters comprised of nothing but various epigrams and short passages regarding the state. Coming from sources as disparate as Horace Greeley and Black Elk to graffiti found at the KU library, these chapters are some of the most entertaining and enriching of the book.William Least Heat Moon is one of the greatest prose stylists I have ever encountered in modern American letters. His writing is rich with metaphor and digression, begging second and third readings of certain passages. While sometimes he expands profusely, Faulkner-like, for paragraphs, clarity is rarely forsaken. It just means reading carefully and slowly. Prairyerth is definitely a book that needs digesting. I took me almost six months to finally devour it up and when I did, I had the distinct feeling of having consumed something grand and very nutritious, albeit a bit heavy. In fact, those without persistent natures would best choose something else to read. Prairyerth is meat and potatoes and requires a lot of chewing. And perhaps that is where the work falls a tad short of its possible ancestor. Whereas one can open Thoreau\`s Walden anywhere and revel in the beauty and wisdom (albeit often cryptic) found therein, Prairyerth is nothing if not taken in its entirety. Its just too dense, with too much stuff packed into its innards. In fact, a little editing could have helped the book. Some chapters are a bit superfluous and leaving them out would have only helped the work as a whole. Moreover, Least Heat Moon\`s astute observations serve his examination of the natural world far better than they support his delving into the human realm. Somehow a lot of the \`characters\` of Chase County never fully come to life in Prairyerth. Rather, they seem two-dimensional and oddly trapped on the page. Yet, taken as a whole and for what it is, a grand archaeological and sociological dig through the layers of New World settlement, Prairyerth succeeds grandly. Never has one tiny and often ignored section of the American quilt come to life so vividly and richly as does Chase County, Kansas in Prairyerth. A place so seemingly devoid of life, is, in actuality, overflowing with the past, present and future. All you have to do is look,look carefully. The author himself says it best: \`A traveler(who cannot even remotely detect the thousand-mile-an-hour spinning of the planet he rides through space at sixty-seven thousand miles an hour, to say nothing of its solar and galactic movements and its precession) writes in his notebook, ~nothing is happening~. Man muses, God guffaws.\` Next time you feel that nothing has ever happened or is happening now or will happen where you\`re at, pick up Prairyerth and be amazed."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"In the heart of the Flint Hills of east-central Kansas lies Chase County, where the green grass waves across all horizons, and where a natural and human history of unbelievable richness belies the wide-open remoteness of the landscape. This history, except for one nationally noteworthy event (Kunute Rockne's demise in a plane crash), had become largely obscured by time and scattered to the prairie winds until reassembled masterfully by the author (WHLM).A voluminous beast of a book at over 600 pages, PrairyErth is a true \\"deep map\\" as advertised, but much less imposing than its cumulative immensity would threaten. It is best read in no particular order, easily compartmentalized by chapters that have distinct identities. One easily can read the section on Bazaar, then Cottonwood Falls, then Matfield, and so forth, irrespective of their relative positions either in the book or on the map. WLHM fittingly divides this rectangular county into quadrangles, adeptly mixing autobiographical sketches of his sojourns by road and trail with all manner of compelling tales of the area's people and structures, from native tribes through European settlement to the early 1990s (press time). A historical treasure chest erupts from every chunk of PrairyErth, pouring forth tales of family feuds, western outlaws, railroad and cattle barons, Civil War partisans, raging prairie fires both natural and deliberate, governmental skullduggery and intrigue, the Rockne crash, buildings built and buildings burned, changes in flora and fauna over the centuries, and even the cherty limestone itself which gives the area its name.I read this book after several trips through Chase County, and the attention to detail of WLHM was captivating. He described tallgrass and sky scenes just as I had photographed, and even found some of the same graffiti-laden stone fenceposts I had perused off of Highway 177. It makes one wonder what will be lost forever without similar \\"deep mapping\\" of any and every other county across the American plains, each of which must have a similarly complex and flavorful story. The only detraction or annoyance -- a minor one -- was WLHM's unabashed leftist slant to his occasional political commentary; but this will bother only a small fraction of readers. I recommend PrairyErth enthusiastically to anyone interested in the American prairie or Western history."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I live in Lyon county, Kanzas, immediatly to the east of Chase County. When this book came out it stirred a great deal of controversy, needless to say. My first exposure to this work was an audio cassette version. I was curious and a bit skeptical about having an &quot;outsider&quot; review our area. To say I was pleased with what I encountered would be an understatement. Heat Moon has done a masterful job, better I think than BLUE HIGHWAYS. Since the book was published a park (of sorts) has been opened just west of Strong City. It consists of a wonderful old, limestone ranch house, the Spring Hill Ranch, which is being renovated and is open to the public and will be featured, eventually, as a &quot;working ranch&quot;. In addition there is a small, stone schoolhouse and acre upon acre of hiking area amid the Tallgrass. Much of this development, I feel, is directly the result of this book. There is a dichotomy at work here in that, while pleased that travelers will come to know more about Kanzas, we are also cautious to keep away the crowds. Moon's work is, as is often expressed in the other reviews, a masterwork regardless of setting."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"We move too fast; our senses are daily bombarded with loud (but shallow) noise. When one comes in contact with a book like \\"PrairyErth\\", it requires a shift of mind, a change of gears.Heat-Moon walks slowly and digs deeply. There are sentences in this book that have great weight- they didn't come easy, and they speak softly. It is a heavy book, but one with which you will develop a lasting relationship. I don't know of any book like it, surely a credit to Heat-Moon's formidable skill of turning land and time into words on paper.I have read this book every year since it came out and have walked on the same ground, talked to some of the same people, known the same dirt roads. I encourage you to do the same, and feel the same pull.This is an important work. A rewarding read. A book that gives back.A deep map, indeed.Gary Gackstatter, St Louis"},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"In Blue Highways the inimitable William Least Heat Moon drove across the backroads of America. In River Horse this courageous, spiritually-venerable man floated in a barge across this nation's waterways. In Prairy Erth, he does his exploration mostly on foot. Confining himself to a microcosmic canvas, Least Heat Moon spends over 600-pages describing how he spent months delving into a single county in the heart of Kansas. Packed with maps of Chase County, its hills, waterways, roads and farmsteads, the author tells a sometimes dry but often rich story of one remote but improbably charming spot on planet earth. He meets many of the county's 3,000 residents, hears and tells of the folklore, the history, the textured layers to life in such a location. By the book's end an unknowingly begun spiritual journey reaches its conclusion, which is the way with all of William Least Heat Moon's writings. If you have the time to put into Prairy Erth, it is a compelling book that challenges the nature of individual outlook."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I started reading this book because it seemed like something &quot;good for me&quot;.

I had read Blue Highways four times when I discovered PrairyErth and bought it. At first I was bitterly disappointed that it wasn't much like Blue Highways. And it had all those quotations at the beginning of each chapter. But as I forced myself to pick up the book and read it, over time, I realized I had to force myself to set it back down again. I lived with the author during every one of his encounters with the locals and found in my memories someone almost like each one of them. His search for Og paralleled my own search for a farm where I lived for only two years while I was seven and eight years old--a place that provided me with a beginning, a young boy's paradise. But alas all that remains is the memory. When I finally found the farm it had been turned into a gravel pit, a super highway and it was so reduced in size it amounted to little more that what remained of William Least Heat-Moon's Og. And it was just as difficult to find."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I used this book for one of my college classes and I loved it. It was one of the few books I kept!

Each paragraph required a pause, a time to savor and think through that which was offered, to see the possibilities.

I have lived enough of a similar life that the book made sense and offered connection. Had I tried to read it 20 years ago I would have shelved it forever.Poetic, factual, spiritual, thought and hope provoking, thank you William Least Heat Moon for not only making the journey, but also for offering hope and guidance to those of us who are on the journey's edge"},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"I have spent some time in Chase County, so I have a personal interest in this book. Otherwise, I can't see myself sticking it out to the finish.The writing is dense and rich, and the character stories and history are fascinating, however...The book is very oddly arranged. In each section the author writes about a selected area for a few chapters and then finishes up writing about Cottonwood Falls (which also has its own section).Each section starts off with 4-6 pages of quotes (Thoreau, Twain, nature guides, et.), most of which do not add anything to the story. I have taken to skimming them for relevancy - like snippets from the local newspaper - but mostly skipping them altogether to speed things up.The author is enamored of the colon (as in punctuation, not anatomy). I counted one sentence with six. To me, this denotes a run-on to the extreme and makes the whole thing incomprehensible. Smaller bites, please! And get thee to an editor!I'm also learning new words right and left, as the author makes full use of an extensive vocabulary. Although, in a 600+ page book, I'm not sure slowing the reader down is the best strategy :)Overall, though, I'm thoroughly fascinated and enjoying this read. I borrowed it and plan to buy a copy for my own library."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Chase County, Kansas might well look like a whole lot of nothing to a whole lot of people. For William Least Heat-Moon, it was a potpourri of American history, culture, and ecology waiting to be uncovered in this 1991 book.For people like me who were blown away by Heat-Moon's prior prose journey, \\"Blue Highways,\\" \\"PrairyErth\\" offers more of his plugged-in philosophical eloquence, wit, and vivid descriptive power. On the down side, \\"PrairyErth\\" presents a structural and, at times, solipsistic mess that runs out of things to say well before reaching its end.The idea of the book is brilliant, and the early chapters bring out this promise best. Each section of five or so chapters is focused on a particular quadrangle of the county, delimited by the author. Our first quadrangle introduces us to the last residents of a village continually overrun by floodwaters, who cheerfully tell Heat-Moon about saving possums and losing pianos. One says: \\"If people don't know any better than to live down here, they'll have to suffer the consequences, but I never knew anyone to die in our floods.\\"Other chapters jump around to cover everything from casual walking analysis of the fossil record of Chase County to the death of the legendary Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne, whose plane crashed down on Chase County in 1931. These chapters are short, sometimes engaging, and very often profound. \\"On the prairie, distance and the miles of air turn movement into stasis and openness to a wall,\\" he writes.A running theme presents Chase County as a formerly diverse habitat done in by excessive grazing and lack of conservation measures. Heat-Moon's sensitivity to Chase County's depleted animal life is on strong display, especially in one powerful chapter which focuses on a recreational coyote hunter who takes Heat-Moon, quietly disapproving, along for one of his pointless, savage hunts. The hunter never comes off as less than agreeable, but in Heat-Moon's hands you may never root so much against a person's success.A little of this goes a long way, or longer at least than the author seems to think. He spends a lot of time on the subject of white people's misuse of the land today, with beef farming and absentee land owners coming up for repeated, lengthy criticism. When Heat-Moon isn't editorializing himself, he's interviewing feminist ranchers and revisionist historians to repeat the same. The people of Chase County mostly fall away a third into the book, as Heat-Moon focuses more on himself and his reactions to what he sees, and even on the labor of researching this book.Too often this comes off as flailing at significance. He consults a Ouija board at one point. At another, he decides to sit in his van and watch a sleepy street corner for 12 hours straight. \\"Never before has anyone sat in a truck here and sipped French-roast espresso, eaten Fig Newtons, tallied wet dogs, and talked to himself,\\" he jokes, a short laugh during a long read.I've never read a book yet made more profound by the insertion of an opening epigram. Heat-Moon shovels pages of them into the beginnings of each section, most making the same points about white greed and cruelty, Christian hypocrisy, and the rape of nature. Worse, the quadrangle idea never takes off. Heat-Moon doesn't really stick to particular quadrangles in his different sections; sometimes he doesn't stay in Chase County at all, obviating his \\"Deep Map\\" subtitle.The book is a great read when taken in pieces rather than as a whole. It's just not easy finding those pieces, and the stretches in between were frustrating for me."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"A book in my top-ten all-time list. It proves that no place is devoid of deep historic, geologic, and geographic meaning--if you are poetic enough, as Least-Heat Moon is, to observe and record it. The enormous amount of detail is presented in such a way that it makes you happy; as it prolongs the experience. The book has unique features--quotes that lead off every chapter, it's &quot;geographic&quot; the organization--that further the pleasure. Every place on earth needs a deep map. I am jealous of anyone from Chase County. I wish my home county had such a comprehensive compendium. To be sure, all of this information is there for the asking, but who esle but WLHM can pull it together in one place and present it in a such a gripping fashion? If you like history, America, people, geology, geography, maps, exploration, or adventure, are experiencing a turning point in your life, or are just someone who appreciates a job well done, this book is for you."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"If only every county in the United States had as passionate and articulate a chronicler as William Least Heat-Moon.I came to \\"PrairyErth\\" after having read and loved \\"Blue Highways.\\" This tome--though longer and less expansive, geographically--possesses many of the qualities I admired in Heat-Moon's earlier work: the narrative tone (there's none of that stuffy, impersonal, third-person prose one finds in some travelogues; the author is himself part of the story), the occasional dips into philosophy and history; the candid interviews with \\"locals\\"; and the intense search for meaning in the most ordinary of places.I have never been to Chase County, Kansas, but after spending a month or so accompanying Heat-Moon through the pages of his book, I feel as though I have. The book is subtitled \\"a deep map,\\" and that is indeed what the author provides here. Square mile by square mile, the reader is introduced to the prairie, its topography and history, its residents and its wildlife. Heat-Moon correctly understands that the essence of a place is often best captured through anecdote and observation. There is nothing sweeping or grand about his narrative, and that's what makes \\"PrairyErth\\" such a delight. It's a detailed, intimate read; one almost has the feeling of looking over the author's shoulder (and back through history) as he ambles and rambles about the quadrangles of Chase County.If there's one criticism I would offer, it's that Heat-Moon sometimes lapses into needless digressions about himself and the challenges he faced while writing the book. It struck me as a bit self-absorbed--as did the occasional Faulknerian stream-of-conscious, punctuationless prose. These stylistic excesses add little to what is otherwise a magnificent and fascinating travelogue."},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"If you want to experience Kansas, with its excruitatingly boring places that slowly creep up on you and leave you blissfully satisfied and in awe of beauty; if you're willing to read long passages of flat text just to discover the beauty of burning fields; I highly recommend PrairyErth.I grew up in Kansas, about 2 hours from Chase county and was always facinated by the hills, the people, and just the auroa that came from Strong City and Cottonwood falls. After reading &quot;PrairyErth&quot; I am even more mesmorized by the locale.I have been out of the state for 2 years now, and long to go back. Many friends have complained about the long drives through Kansas, the flat scenery, and boring people. PrairyErth brings to life these flat lands and opens up new worlds of community and life.For me, reading Moon's book was much like experiencing life in Kansas. I did find some of the chapters long, dry, and dull.. but, that's how some Kansas life is. Moon always concludes these sections with a gorgeous snapshot of the land. He shows us what it is like to be in relationship with the land just as we are in relationship with one another.He concludes the book with a beautiful journey down the Kaw Trail.&quot;How do you know when the Prairy is in you?&quot;&quot;When you see a tree as an eyesore.&quot;"},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Where Blue Highways sprawled across the continental United States in a macro-view of America, William Least Heat-Moon reverses the lens and concentrates on (mostly) walking and (sometimes) driving a tiny subsection of the USA: Chase County, in the Flint Hills of eastern Kansas. The people he meets--the old timers who've seen the river rise and fall and mined the quarries, the feminist restauranteur, the female ranchers determined to succeed in the face of declining small-farm agriculture and chauvinism--are people who might make unlikely subjects for straight fiction, but Least Heat-Moon's gift is to make us care about their personal stories and worries anyway. The ecological, social, and political sides of Chase--and the personal issues and flights of fancy of the author's psyche--come into sharp focus under Least Heat-Moon's eye, which misses little; and his writing is clear enough to make you forget that you're reading something fascinating about something commonplace.

Reading (and now re-reading) PrairyErth, I have had the strange experience of having childhood memories from the Flint Hills come pouring back over me. I'll even find myself reminded of something--cottonwoods, prairie chickens, floods--that had not yet been mentioned, only to find it two pages later. And the people! I could hear their voices, the only time I have seen the gentle Hills accent in print. So, as one who played softball with hedge balls, just let me tell you...this is an author who knows Chase County, Kansas. Way to go!"},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Open the book. Chase County, Kansas has U.S. Route 50 and the Kansas Turnpike running through it. The Flint Hills are the last remaining grand expanse of tall grass in America. The population of Chase County is 3,013. This is clearly William Least Heat-Moon's masterpiece. The closest reading experience I can summon is that of Barry Lopez's ARCTIC DREAMS.Chase County, Kansas is an empty area in relative terms. The arrangement of the book is to follow a sort of geographical grid. The author introduces new concerns with a series of paragraphs and quotations from other works. Individual stories are inserted for interest and historical verisimilitude. For example, Gabriel Jacobs was a Dunkard preacher from Indiana. He and his wife arrived in Chase County in 1856.The book is filled with maps. Cottonwood Falls, State Lake, Spring Creek, Den Creek, Rock Creek, Cottonwood River, Sharp Creek, Roniger Hill, Landon Rocks and Bazaar are shown on the map of the Bazaar Quadrangle. Chase County is tall grass country and beef is the major pursuit. It absolutely depends upon grass. The work of Chase is to turn soil and cellulose into humaly digestible carbohydrates and protein. Tribal people took their health from prairie plants. Antelope are returning to the Flint Hills through a restocking program. The author observes that the land in Chase County is like a good library, it lets a fellow extend himself. Common Chase properties of the land are the vales and uplands through which the author enjoyed traveling.A review by me cannot do justice to this book. The work is as multi-dimensional as EXECUTIONER'S SONG by Norman Mailer. Vachel Lindsay traveled down the Cottonwood Valley. A student going to high school in Chase County thinks there is no privacy, no opportunity to be one's self. A grade school teacher told the author she hoped that pople in Chase County could learn to love themselves less and the children more. The largest cottonwood in Kansas has a trunk 27 feet around. The Timber Culture Act of 1873 gave 160 acres of land to the settler who would plant ten of these acreas in trees. In 1931 a Fokker plane carrying the famous football coach Knute Rockne crashed in Chase County near Bazaar. People ariving in Chase County after 1862, the Homestead Act, were limited to taking a quarter section, 160 acres. Most county bottom land had been claimed by 1870. Absentee land ownership has been a fact of life in Chase County since the 19th century when the English aristocracy and the railroads owned large tracts.The author says that for him writing is not a search for explanations, but a ramble. He believes that Chase County is the ideal place to develop a prototype of a new agricultural community. The book began when the author arrived at Roniger Hill with an image of a topographical grid in his head. Of the dozen settlements in Chase County, three or four can still be called villages and two are towns. The significance of praryerth is that Chase County lies among it. \\"The Praryerths and Blackerths are deep soils, lightly granular, relatively nonacid, unleached, with full stores of humus and minerals.\\""},{"Title":"PrairyErth","review":"Having read BLUE HIGHWAYS several years ago I was excited when PRAIRYERTH came out and couldn't wait to read it. Even though itwas a huge book of about a thousand pages, my admiration for William Least Heat Moon was such that I knew I wanted to read this book.When I began to realize we were never going to leave one county in Kansas I was already near the end of the book and wished that it wouldn't end.I don't recommend this book to casual readers, for I think they will miss the beauty and fascination contained in these pages. But for those who love poetry and the sheer beauty of words mixed in with simplicity of spirit in story telling, there are few books that can come close to this one.

For me it didn't meet that requirement.The book does have a section for each of the objectives Microsoft has defined for the exam. But is FULL of errors (typos and concepts too!!), lacking good examples, concepts are defined vaguely and there is A LOT left out.I took the exam and passed but I don't feel it was because of the book. I had to do additional research on each topic because the book wasn't enough. And in the exam there is definitely much more than the book covers.The 2 stars are because:1. The CD that comes with the book. The practice tests are very helpful to prepare for the exam, not only because they are exam-like questions but because you see some topics that weren't even mentioned on the book.2.

It has couple of omissions (Ex., missing a file or so in one or two labs in data access). But, I think by now that should also be available in their support website. This book comes with 300 practice test questions. After having gone through other pratcice exam material, I think this fares much better (only a couple of repetitions or errors).

This book gives historical clues needed to understand why, even though both were colonized by European Settlers, South America differs in its culture and its political institutions so much from North America. This author shows what elements and historical trends the two colonial cultures shared as well as the many differences between them.Among the shared elements are that the frontiers were extended to the whole continent, the continent was taken over from the indigenous population, African slaves were introduced to provide most of the labor, Native Americans were removed, or exterminated, and elaborate mother country structures were erected.Among the differences are the obvious ones: South America is Spanish-Indian-Catholic; while North America is Anglo-Protestant. Both were built by slaves working similar crops; both had similar trade relationships with the mother country. In the U.S., Native cultures were destroyed by so-called \\"civilizing effects\\" of the British. In South America, full armies invaded and conquered the lands and yet, native cultures for the most part survived and have shown remarkable resilience and vigor. In the English American colonies, democracy found its roots in town meetings and in representative assemblies. In South America, the democratic impulse never took hold, and even today remains more muted. Concern for individual rights, which became a staple and the centerpiece of Anglo-American tradition also did not take hold in South America. There, as was the case in the southern U.S., the concern was more with \\"frontier honor\\" than with individual freedom. Another difference is that the French rather than the American Revolution sparked South American Revolutions. However, they were not sparked by mass movements advanced on behalf of worker's freedoms but rather as status revolts between competing upper classes. They were mostly disputes between the settlers in the colonies and their colonial overseers sent from European capitals to oversee the colonies.The book is well documented, logical and provides many insights into the organization and structure of colonization -- insights that inspire interpretive analyses. As but a few such examples that piqued my interests are the following ones:1. Spain and Portugal were the pre-eminent superpowers at the turn of the 15th Century. Like other maritime powers, to engage in exploratory expeditions financed by the kingdom, they availed themselves of the best seamen in the world at the time, the Italians. The era of exploration was an integral part of the spirit of the Renaissance; and exploration, conquest and exploitation were a co-terminus trifecta: You could not have one without the others. Owing to a desire to expand their respective empires and enrich the kingdom, both countries excelled at all three. England got into the game almost a century later, and never quite caught up.2.The model of colonial settlement that the English (who settled North America) used was that left by Spain, not something acquired in England itself. The Spanish model was mimicked and repeated in minute detail by the English settlers that founded the U.S.3. Exploratory expeditions into the new world were serious, carefully orchestrated, exquisitely micromanaged affairs by the kingdoms back in Europe, designed to establish and maintain control over a pipeline of wealth flowing continuously from the colonies back to the motherland. As a result, ship crews were \\"stacked\\" so that they constituted all the elements needed to establish a royal feudal fiefdom and province within the colony. The crews thus were made up not only of farmers, soldiers and craftsmen, but also of clergy, lawyers, surveyors, assayers, real estate managers and tax collectors.4. Conquest was as much about racial mastery as it was about economic exploitation. Societal hierarchy was little more than the human version of the \\"Alpha Male syndrome,\\" in which military combat served to establish what races were at the top of the pecking order and which were at the bottom. Owing mostly to the horse and the gun, and the missionaries of the Catholic Church, white European became the \\"Alpha males\\" of the colonies. And as still exists throughout Western societies even today, there was a color-coded sliding scale along the status-wise societal hierarchy that went from whites at the top, down to Blacks at the bottom.5.Since 95% of settlers were men, sexual exclusivity was an unspoken and unacknowledged integral part of the dominance equation: White women were scarce and thus \\"dear,\\" sought after, and protected by the \\"Alpha male white man.\\" \\"Honor,\\" and racial purity developed as an outgrowth of this syndrome and evolved into a very sensitive determiner of social class and status throughout the colonies. So did the mixed offspring of white male on non-white female sexual encounters. As was the case in the motherland, the converse sexual pairings were outlawed.6. The Catholic Church greatly facilitated all social and economic processes in the direction of maintaining and consolidating the colonial economic, social and political status quo. Contrary to common historical understandings, military combat alone was not the primary modality of conquest, but religious indoctrination coupled with rampant diseases introduced by the colonizers. With the help of the Kingdom, the Catholic Church was able to grab up and accrue immense wealth mostly in land holding acquired from Natives who died of sicknesses, gifts, and legal renderings handed down in the Church's favor by the kingdom. There are books still to be written on the embarrassing role the Catholic Church played in facilitating colonial exploitation and imperialist expansion.7.Encomienda was a way station somewhere between slavery and freedom that allowed the Conquestadores to exploit native populations without the guilt of outright looting or formal slavery. It never reached North America, because North American colonizers did not come as invading armies of conquerors.Five Stars"},{"Title":"Spain in America (The New American Nation Series)","review":"This book was the text for a college course and I found it to be excellently written and chock-full of useful, detailed information.

It felt as though Gibbons was trying to say that the Native Americans were cruel savages who needed to be westernized voluntarily or through force. He showed minimal effort in describing the plight that disease had on the Natives and constantly tried to defend the Spanish for what they did. He also tried to make De las Casas appear to not know what he was talking about in his defense of the Native Americans, and that Spain was justified in conquering the Americas and enslaving their people. He also goes into more detail than ought to have been necessary in describing the romantic aspect of the conquest, almost making the massacres and genocide sound like a great adventure that he only wished he could have partaken in himself. I felt this book was offensive, especially in the beginning of chapter 3 where he says \\"It was clear who was the master race,\\" referring to the white conquistadors. It seems as if he wanted to be impartial in his analysis, but when reading his descriptions of Native peoples as \\"cruel savages,\\" I couldn't help but feel that he was agreeing with those who would say that Native Americans needed to be conquered by Christians. There may have been human sacrifice and war in America, but is this really any worse than the atrocities that were going on throughout Christian Europe during the the 1500's? I felt that he sided with and defended the ideologies of the conquistadors more than was necessary, and did not give a fair and equal treatment to both sides of the argument. I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a good and fair analysis of Latin American history."},{"Title":"Conformist","review":"I tried watching the movie AFTER the book and I had NO patience with the movie, though directed by a person for whom I have great respect. Moravia is a lyricist and this prose poem of a novel describes some very hard facts of boyhood during fascist times in Italy, and more. The boy becomes a man, a conformist, due to an incredible mistake. And a mistaken mistake at that! Add to this an almost abusive father, who is institutionalized later in the novel, his lovely decadent drug addict mother with her 15 small dogs, and her chauffer, of course. A most harrowing, yet not disbeleivable, ending winds up the novel in just two pages. More from Moravia! Get this book back in print! For the scenes in the Paris clubs, it is alone worth reading this fascinating book. I read it two years ago and it has stayed with me, unlike many of my other favotite novels.

But now that I've read all about the academic culture and culture surrounding campus, I have seen inside the world more than I would have if I'd just gone on a campus tour. The student perspective makes it all the better because it's not propagandistic, since they show all sides. It's a great way to learn about a school you know nothing about, or even if you're an incoming freshman I imagine it would be useful to read about campus housing, parking, and off-campus dining."},{"Title":"The life and ministry of Jesus","review":"In 1954, Vincent Taylor wrote this book, which is a calm and reasonable (yet critical) analysis of the gospel and related materials. He states in the Preface, \\"Anyone who attempts to write a life of Christ must recognize from the outset that his task will end in failure, greater or less as the case may be, and that he must be ready to face failure in his endeavor to see the historic Jesus more clearly.\\"He suggests, \\"Documentary hypotheses are not likely to be abandoned, but it is probable that all the evangelists, including the Fourth Evangelist, have drawn upon oral tradition to a greater extent than has been commonly recognized,\\" and summarizes, \\"The fact which emerges from the modern study of the Gospel tradition is its trustworthiness, provided we do not make impossible demands upon it.\\"He strongly contrasts John the Baptist and Jesus: \\"It is clear that John did not describe the Messiah according to popular expectation as a national deliverer, but as the eschatological prophet and judge.\\" He adds, \\"John's metaphors were those of a threshing floor, a winnowing fan, and an axe laid at the root of the tree; but Jesus pictured the joy of finding buried treasure and of lighting upon a precious pearl. The Kingdom, as Jesus presented it, had the explosive force of leaven and all the potency of growth found in a tiny mustard seed.\\"Taylor argues, \\"To deny the historical character of the choice and appointment of the Twelve is unwarranted, so deeply is the tradition concerning them rooted in the Gospels.\\" He suggests that although the 53rd chapter of Isaiah is quoted only once in the gospels (Lk 22:37), its notion of a \\"suffering Servant\\" underlay Jesus' idea of his mission. \\"Communities do not create sayings; still less do they creatively combine diverse ideas like the Son of man and the suffering Servant of Isa. 53.\\" He also state \\"(I)t is in every way probable that (Jesus) used colorful Old Testament imagery to express the conviction that the Kingdom would be consummated ... Doubtless, he expected that the interval would be short.\\"Concerning Jesus' reply to Pilate in Matthew 26:64, \\"You have said so,\\" Taylor comments, \\"No answer could show more clearly how much Jesus disliked the title 'the Messiah.' not because he rejected the office, but because his view of its nature and that of his generation were poles asunder.\\"Taylor concludes on the note, \\"No obligation is imposed on us to either ignore the difficulties of the resurrection narratives or to attempt to explain them away. What must be insisted upon is that they are not of first importance, since belief in the risen Christ has better foundations. The Christ whose story we have sought to recall, Son of man and Son of God, who believed that his suffering was necessary for the salvation of men, is one for whom death could not be the end.\\"Although an \\"older\\" study, Taylor's book is still well worth reading for anyone interested in the \\"historical\\" Jesus."},{"Title":"Fiberglass Rod Making","review":"Making your own rods is an enjoyable craft as well as a rewarding one.

Most textbooks present it in a scholarly way, focusing on transaltions of the works of ancient authors, and not giving modern learners a connection to their lives. The Ecce Romani series presents Latin in an innovative and attractive way. Every chapter begins with a a painted color picture and short story (in latin) about a fictional Roman family made up of Cornelius-a senator, Aurelia-his wife, Marcus-son, Cornelia-daughter, and Sextus- a boy staying with them for a period of time. Each tale develops the family and other characters as well as showing aspects of daily life. All the new vocabulary (old vocab is sometimes included too) is included on the same page. If you have every studied a foreign language, you know how easy paragraphs are to read when you have all the English words on the same page. The 2 column list contains nouns, verbs, expressions, adverbs, etc. A new grammar concept is introduced after each story, and future stories continue to use it, so it is not forgotton. This way, the stories become more detailed (and interesting) as you progress.On the pages after the story are also pictures, maps, and helpful excercises that furthur your understanding on the language and culture. In between most chapters are short and informative lessons about daily life, myths, history, among other things. (For example: \\"A Roman Family\\", \\"Aeneas\\", and \\"The Founding of Rome\\")At the end of the book is an outline of all the grammar explored, complete with noun and verb charts. There is also a Latin to English, and English to Latin dictionary containing EVERY WORD in the stories plus their chapter number.I would recomend this book to ANYONE interested in studying Latin, as I think it's the best book on the market. It's easy to learn with, colorful, tastefully put together (no tacky graphics and layouts typically employed in textbooks), and packed with maps and pictures. Try this out and soon you'll will have a thorough understanding of Latin!"},{"Title":"ECCE ROMANI STUDENT BOOK LEVEL 1 HARDCOVER","review":"This is a very well-written textbook series. I took Latin I and II using this series, but I had to switch to the Cambridge Latin series for Latin III when I changed schools. Ecce Romani is a much better series than Cambridge. It contains many assets (such as an English-Latin AND Latin-English dictionary, multiple challenging practice exercises in each chapter, enjoyable stories, well-organized vocabulary sections in each chapter, etc.) necessary for the enjoyable and productive study of Latin which the Cambridge books lack. The Ecce Romani books are well organized and more enjoyable to learn from. I highly recommend this well-written series to everyone."},{"Title":"ECCE ROMANI STUDENT BOOK LEVEL 1 HARDCOVER","review":"Although I have studied (to some extent) quite a few foreign languages, I have never come across a textbook quite as beautiful and captivating as this one! Using the immersion method, the student is plunged into a study of Roman language and culture, instead of a detached, intellectual method that most textbook authors are accustomed to using. The language is taught in a series of interesting (and often amusing!) stories that tell the evolving tale of the Cornelii, an upper-class Roman family. And each chapter is illustrated with a lovely drawing by an artist that clearly put much time into it. By teaching culture, society, and mythology at the same time as the language, this book succeeds in bringing ancient Rome to life and interesting many an apathetic high-schooler. As for myself, although my school doesn't offer Latin III, I will gladly dole out the $$ for the third in this series to continue the study myself. If you're a first-time Latin teacher looking for a well-rounded text, then LOOK NO FURTHER!"},{"Title":"A Gentle Creature and Other Stories: White Nights; A Gentle Creature; and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man (The World's Classics)","review":"This excellent collection has three of Dostoevsky's best short works: \\"White Nights,\\" \\"A Gentle Creature,\\" and \\"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man.\\" Ranging from great to masterful, they are essential for anyone even remotely interested in Dostoevsky and a good starting point before tackling his mammoth novels. However, as they are available in collections with additional stories -- such as The Best Short Stories of Dostoevsky --, this is not the best choice. That said, anyone who comes across it and has not read the stories would do well to get it.\\"White\\" is one of Dostoevsky's most intensive love meditations and, indeed, one of the most profoundly searching and affecting - not to mention thorough and honest - investigations of the perennial subject. He shows many of its sides, including those most writers and people ignore, with such realism and emotion that they come across as powerfully as ever - and surely always will. Though missing some of his later depth, this is in many ways one of Dostoevsky's most timeless works. It is also interesting in his canon in that the narrator prefigures some of his more famous characters, especially the Underground Man.\\"A Gentle\\" may be Dostoevsky's best short story, a masterpiece in many ways as great as his novels. Moving well beyond his early short works' directness, it is a complex, multi-layered piece that can be legitimately interpreted in many ways. The psychological depth for which his novels are so justly famous is here in full force, as is his strong first-person voice. The narration is indeed one of the highlights, as Dostoevsky uses several techniques - unreliable narrator, stream of consciousness, etc. - not common until about half a century later. This shows his vast originality and influence, but the story also has many core strengths, especially a focus on perennial Dostoevsky themes: suicide, mental instability, love's dark side, egotism's evils, and other heavy psychological, philosophical, and social themes.\\"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man\\" is one of Dostoevsky's best, most original, and most influential short stories. It epitomizes several of his defining preoccupations - alienation, Christian charity, etc. - and is a preeminent example of his characteristic psychological realism. A first-person tour de force, it shows yet again that no one matches him for psychological verisimilitude. It is also heavy on his core philosophical concerns and, perhaps most notably, pioneered important concepts that had not even been defined, namely psychoanalysis and solipsism. One can easily see why Freud frequently cited Dostoevsky, as this story essentially prefigured much of his work on dreams by several decades. Fantastic as the story is in some ways - recalling the wilder flights of Paradise Lost and arguably even being almost a science fiction precursor -, it is one of Dostoevsky's most moving and deeply human works.Wherever one chooses to read them, these stories are required reading."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Thank god I had this book along with me on what turned out to be the longest flight I've ever been on -- I couldn't have put Blindsided down if I wanted to. Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks, detectives, lovers, and partners against crime, are two of the best drawn characters in the world of mysteries. Together they must sort out the drama not only in their relationship, but in a frightening series of murders that'll keep your heart pumping, page after page. Beautifully written, with enough plot twists to turn you upside-down, Blindsided is a classic -- shrewd, satisfying, brilliant. Bravo Clyde Phillips."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I purchased this book based on a rave review I happened upon in Publisher's Weekly whose reviewer, I'm sure, did not know Clyde Phillips. Nor do I, though I feel I want to respond to one here posted as &quot;Only Mystery Is The Good Reviews&quot;. Thrillers are my thing. I read many. And I have to say that Blindsided is an expceptional thriller on every level -- plot, character, dialogue. If there are more glowing reviews on this site, must be because the book deserves it. It was great. Take it from me."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"As law enforcement officials, Inspector Jane Andriotti and Kenny Marks risk their lives to serve and protect the public. At times, they may perform heroic acts, but like most police officers, the couple recognizes they are just performing their jobs as members of a unique club linked by the danger of their occupation. However, the relationship between Jane and Kenny goes way beyond that of comrades in arms They are lovers and the day they move in together, the brass assigns them to investigate the brutal murder of a former cop turned druggie.The killer Jacques Carpentier served fifteen years of hard time. Back on the street, Jacques has a personal agenda to complete. Jacques plans vengeance on specific members of the SFPD. By the third murder, the police conclude a serial killer has targeted them for termination. Neither Jane, in charge of the case, nor Kenny has any idea who the perpetrator is or why he is killing cops and former cops. Though they jeopardize their lives doing their job, Jane and Kenny know they must stop the culprit before another person is found dead.The taut story line with its switching locations and superb characterizations are so well written, it will blind-side the sub-genre by turning it into a new direction. The story line is fast-paced while Mr. Phillips' magically switches locales in an effortlessly manner that actually propels the plot forward. However, it is the humanization of the characters, who grow as they learn from their errors, that turns this thriller into a mega-chiller. Readers of BLINDSIDED will be obsessed to read Clyde Phillips' previous novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I found this book fasinating and enjoyed it even more than the first of the series. The relationship between the two main characters has depth and their interplay adds a nice counter foil to the gritty reality of their search for the killer.It is a tour of San Francisco, murder and life, with a touch of humor. This book is a good read. Put it in your beach or travel bag."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I didn't want to put it down once I got started reading on the plane. Apart from the wonderful twists and turns within the story itself, the emotional depth is what distinguishes this book from the pack. Family, and its many shapes and definitions, is a wonderful subtext to the events which occur in the lives of Phillips' characters. This is awesome stuff."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"This book holds all the action and psychological suspense of books written by James Patterson. I like Clyde Phillips and will be anxiously waiting for future books from this author. The book began with a gut-wrenching murder that grasped the reader's attention from the very first page and never let go.Kenny Marks and Jane Candiotti are making a commitment in their relationship and moving in together. As luck would have it, moving day is more memorable than anticipated. A bizarre murder of a former police officer, now down-and-out and hooked on drugs, has just taken place. Marks and Candiotti are called to the scene. This is just the beginning of a diabolical killer's plan for revenge, a fiendish criminal who spent fifteen years in prison planning his fever-pitched killing spree. The action and suspense keep the plot twisting and turning from start to finish.The book has a well-developed plot and, for the most part, strong characters, particularly that of the killer. The only down side of the book was the rather juvenile persona of Jane Candiotti when it came to her romantic relationship. The professional and personal characteristics of this character conflicted. Although love does make us feel young, the events and dialogue in regard to the romance came across as immature and adolescent, particularly for a forty year old woman. Jane Candiotti is supposedly strong and mature, capable of tracking down a hard-core criminal, but her juvenile personal side left the reader feeling she was too immature in her personal life to be credible in her professional life. For this reason the book lost a star in the rating.Overall, the book was a great thriller. It was well-written with a super-dynamic plot, although the author might do a little more research on firearms (there were a few blunders in that department.) The book was still a terrific read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Blindsided - the sequel to Fall From Grace - is an amazing book. The twists and turns of the story keep you up late at night, reading until the wee-morning hours. Once you pick this book up, it'll be a struggle to put it down!You can tell the author, Clyde Phillips, has put hours of research and reading into this novel. It's truley wonderful, this book. It has everything - love, romance, action, suspense, comedy, etc. The characters are detailed, believable and so real that it's astonishing they're fiction.And, just as his first novel (Fall From Grace) there's an incredible ending and conclusion. Once again, the culprit is someone you'd never expect to even hurt a fly. I read this book in about 3 days; hour on top of hour, reading and trying to figure out what's going to happen next. My cats were annoyed by me staying up so late!! :)If you're looking for a novel that has a believable, strong and excellent story line, this book is a dream. Truthfully, I believe anyone, with any kind of love for books, will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Clyde Phillips is perfecting his craft. In &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;, he introduced us to Homicide Inspector Jane Candiotti, a beautiful, yet emotionally flawed woman who makes some choices that definitely aren't in her best interest. In Phillips newest novel, &quot;Blindsided&quot;, Candiotti is back, and seems to have grown and even learned from her previous mistakes. Reaching much more satisfying and believable emotional depths, Phillips pulls out all the stops in this rip-roaring, brilliant thriller.Someone has brutally murdered a homeless junkie. Just another day on the job for Candiotti and her partner Kenny Marks. ..until they discover that the homeless man was once one of their own. When yet another officer is brought down, Candiotti begins to suspect that there's more to these seemingly random killings than she can put her finger on. As the killer gets more and more daring, Candiotti and Marks must race to find him before he can kill again.Phillips craftily plays the mounting suspense of the pursuit of the police killer against Candiotti's newfound resolution to settle down and find love, with none other than her partner, Marks. As her life becomes more and more perfect, the killer gets closer and closer to home...creating some of the most intense dramatic tension captured on a page. Although the reader finds out who the killer is pretty early on in the story, that knowledge only heightens the adrenaline rush as we follow his every move...and his ultimate target: Jane Candiotti. Creating a profoundly believable cast, Phillips has given us the perfect thriller, from the first word to the very last! I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Sure it's graphic as many other reviewers have pointed out. But it's about cops chasing a serial killer. You don't want graphic, don't read about serial killers, they aren't nice guys.Anyway, this book has a million twists and turns. Never dull. Inspector Jane Candiotti and her partner (both on and off the force) Kenny Marks are likeable and interesting from Page 4, when you first meet them. Same for the other cops in their squad, you quickly get attached to this group.If you like thrillers and can take a little gore, read on, you won't be disappointed. I read alot of thrillers and this is the best one I've read in ages."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Clyde Phillips treats his readers to another brilliant episode of Jane and Kenny in SF, this time teetering at the top of the Transamerica Tower. Plan on reading this thriller in one seating -- it's impossible to put down. This summer, you won't need to go any further than BLINDSIDED for a warm summer romance and a white-knuckle roller coaster ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I hate it when a great storyteller gets the details wrong. In one scene he has his heroine taking the safety off her revolver (only one or two revolvers have ever been made with safeties, and they are quite rare). In another scene he has the bad guy slamming the clip home on his automatic, then swinging the cylinder out to reload. If he is going to write police fiction, he ought to at least familiarize himself with guns. It is a great story, though, and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Blindsided moves at such a break-neck pace you can't help but be drawn into the lives of San Francisco detectives Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks. Phillips has wonderfully crafted characters you'll care about and an ending that will keep you riveted. Suspenseful. Intelligent. Poignant. Phillips doesn't leave an emotion unturned. A true sit down, cover-to-cover read."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"The most suspenseful book I've read in years. Captivating characters you intensely care about. An engrossing, elegant and fully satisfying read. Can't wait for the next installment. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Apparently Clyde Phillips thinks gore is more important than good writing. I don't see how anyone would want to waste their time reading a book that starts out with someone getting their eyes gouged out with a spoon."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"This follow up to &quot;Fall from Grace&quot; brings back our heroes, Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks, and lets them get more personally involved, in light of Jane's near-fatal mistake in the first book.The murderer in this one is identified early on, but does not take away any of the suspense Phillips so craftily builds. The inclusion of Kenny's nephew in the story adds a different twist, and actually, ends up saving the heroes' lives at one point.The killer is a nasty one, shooting out the eyes of former or current police officers. Phillips pulls some surprises in that he allows some of the officers we've become familiar with in both novels to come to rather unexpected ends.The final twist is a real big one, and Phillips handles it expertly and believably.Looking forward to more Candiotti and Marks escapades in the future. A great read."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"All the elements are there: an endless twisting and turning try-to-predict-what-happens-next-and-be-continually amazed &amp; surprised plot; real, flesh and blood characters who behave like human beings, not movie star heroes; clever, funny, intelligent dialogue; an enigmatic villain; and just enough emotion to keep all the elements together. Mr. Phillips is an all-pro, master story-teller. If you're looking for a night or weekend (the book reads quickly and easily) of knuckle-clenching, page-turning entertainment, read Blindsided."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Author Clyde Phillips once again takes his readers on a wild, action packed adventure in his new novel, BLINDSIDED. Revisiting Inspector Jane Candiotti (the fiesty memorable central character from his first novel, FALL FROM GRACE), Phillips picks up where his former story concluded without missing a beat. In fast-paced, snappy chapters, Phillips propels his readers along at a dizzying rate that will leave them breathless and ready for more. With his in-depth experience as a television producer (He's behind the series \\"Suddenly Susan,\\" and most recently the new Fox TV hit \\"Get Real\\"), Phillips knows the importance of grabbing an audience's attention and never letting go until the last emotion-twisting end. BLINDSIDED is the ultimate E-ticket of mysteries. This reviewer, for one, can't wait for the next installment of Jane Candriotti's life story. Write faster, Clyde!"},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I'm amazed that the SAME writer who created Suddenly Susan(the upbeat television show starring Brooke Shields) also wrote a book where the opening chapter contains a segment where a man's eyes are gouged out of his head with a rusty spoon before his head is shattered by a rock. Then again, maybe it isn't so odd, because this novel is written with a spare, tight intensity that keeps it moving along, edited as tightly as those television shows made to fit 30 or 60 minute formats. The basic story involves San Francisco Homicide Inspector Jane Candiotti and her partner Kenny Marks, forced to take down a madman with revenge on his mind, a revenge he spent 15 years planning while locked away in prison. Although action, not character portrayal, is writer Clyde Phillips strong point, I did find Candiotti to be a compelling personality, a woman entering her 40's who is finally allowing herself to think of committing herself to a future that goes beyond her job (and involving, not so coincidentally, her partner, Kenny), a cop with a believable domestic side who loves to cook and decorate. Fellow cop Kenny Marks is equally compelling and figuring out who the killer is and what motivates him makes for an intriguing read - and a satisfying one."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I didn't read Clyde Phillips first book but if this one is anything like to first I'm going to run not walk to buy it. I could not put this book down. It took so many twists and turns I was hanging on for dear life.The main characters, Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks, sound like any couple in a realtionship. But they also work together, which can sometimes spell doom for a couple and at times they let their personal relationship trickle into their professional, they still manage to get the job done.Well done to Clyde Phillips, will definitely be picking up his first book and will eagerly await his next."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"Mr. Phillips new book is an astonishing throwback to the acknowledged classics of the genre, but with a new twist: characters Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks are heroes for a modern era, showing us their vulnerable and funny sides. Their character quirks, in addition to rip-roaring action, satisfying and startling plot twists, and gut-wrenching terror make this book perfect for the beach, perfect for the plane... well, it's just... perfect. This is Mr. Phillips second book, and he's the kind of new fresh voice that has re-invigorated the mystery for me. Keep it up, Mr. Phillips."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"If you read before you go to bed, plan on sacrificing a few hours of sleep for this great page turner. Not only is it exciting but smart and funny too. Bravo Mr. Phillips."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"I picked up this book because of the glowing reviews, and was very disappointed.

I couldn't even buy the bad guy, who wasn't anything more complex than a cartoon character."},{"Title":"Blindsided: A Mystery","review":"In his cop team of Jane Candiotti and Kenny Marks, Phillips has created an unforgettable and unbeatable duo.

In this book, the simple rhymes of Carolyn Kowalczyk are well complemented by the lovely artwork of Gene Sharp.The rhymes follow a standard format: &quot;A petal is part of a flower. / A rainbow is part of a shower. / A feather is part of a bird. / A letter is part of a word.&quot; Each sentence is accompanied by an illustration. The colorful illustrations have a soft, gentle quality to them. Another nice touch is the fact that the artwork depicts people of various racial/ethnic characteristics.The educational value of the book is enhanced by a word list at the end. Overall, a well done collaboration, with a wonderfully poetic title."},{"Title":"Passion for Pulses : A Feast of Beans, Peas & Lentils from Around the World","review":"This cookbook contains a wide variety of recipes for beans and legumes, from many different styles of cooking, such as Australian, Middle-Eastern, European, Asian and Indian.As a vegetarian, I found it a very useful cookbook since about 30% of the savory recipes are strictly vegetarian, and a further 20% or so could be converted by substituting vegetable stock for meat stock. Then there are the desserts, which are of course meat-free. The food is very nice.There are also lots of hints about the preparation and nutritional value of legumes, peas and beans, including information on how to save time, and how to avoid the wind some people experience with legumes.I would recommend this book highly to anyone interested in learning more about beans and peas, to anyone interested in eating more beans and vegetables, to people interested in trying ideas from different cuisines, and to anyone looking for quick, healthy, yummy recipes. Many recipes are suitable for vegetarians, some are suitable for vegans (and many of the other recipes can be converted easily). Most of the recipes are suitable for diabetics, except those marked as indulgences."},{"Title":"Passion for Pulses : A Feast of Beans, Peas & Lentils from Around the World","review":"I've been hearing for years that I should eat more pulses and legumes, but I wasn't really sure what they were.Now that I have this book, they've become my favorite food group.

Maurice 'Lee' Lihou was a pilot who flew two tours in 1944-45 in Vickers Wellington bombers. His OUT OF THE ITALIAN NIGHT volume, published in 2003 by Airlife Publishing, furnishes a rare look at a poorly-chronicled segment of the RAF air war over Europe.OUT OF THE ITALIAN NIGHT was originally published in 1992 as IT'S DICEY FLYING WIMPYS. Loved by her crews, the rugged twin-engined bomber served throughout the war. Indeed Lihou's last mission, on 14 March 1945, was also the last Wimpy mission of the ETO air war. Lihou flew two tours, logging 49 missions with 37 and 40 Squadrons, 205 Group.The RAF's air war in the Med was vastly different than that waged over Europe. Lihou's initial night missions might have seen a total force of 10-12 bombers dispatched versus the hundreds of bombers Arthur Harris was sending against German targets. Most of the opposition facing Lihou and other 205 Group aircrews in the Med came from flak, nightfighters being few in number. Attack altitudes were lower, multiple passes were often the norm and so on. Yet the Med air war could be just as deadly as on 6-7 July 1944 when 13 of 61 205 Group bombers were lost in one night.Along with extensively describing his earlier RAF service and every mission flown, Lihou goes into much detail about the stresses he dealt with flying combat. OUT OF THE ITALIAN NIGHT offers a rare look into the mind of a young man who \\"presssed on\\" despite his inner demons.Maurice Lihou's book is certainly a rara avis, a wonderfully-written, exceptionally detailed and brutally honest portrait of a bomber pilot at war. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Out of the Italian Night: Wellington Bomber Operations 1944-45 (Airlife Classics)","review":"The 'Wimpy' or Wellington bomber may have looked formidable from a distance but when up close you realise just how slight was the air frame that was all the protection afforded to the pilots and crews.Not much has been written about the Italian Campaign which makes the book, not just a great read, but a historically important document.The author, now sadly deceased, tells how at 19 he flew mission after mission across mountains and through flak to frustrate the supply chain for German army.A highly moving account about the man, his life, and love of his life - Maurice Lihou."},{"Title":"Heroes, Lovers, and Others: The Story of Latinos in Hollywood","review":"It was that gorgeous sepia cover of Rita Hayworth that first drew me to this book. I'm not a movie buff, but that classic pose captivated me, and when I saw the numerous dramatic stills of famous screen icons from across the entire history of film, I immediately purchased four copies-for my mother, my two aunts and my niece.Rita Hayworth was born Margarita Carmen Cansino, I quickly learned, and she had begun her career as a a Latin dancer and actor. Her's is only one of a flood of stories of Latinos stars throughout Hollywood's first century. The book is an easy and quick read, but I ended up learning a lot about how the history of Hollywood and America are intertwined. I felt that the historical context deepened and enriched the stories and provided them with a greater meaning.One of my favorite stories is about an Austrian actor named Jacob Krantz, whose acting career was going nowhere until he changed his name to Ricardo Cortez and immediately became a big star. His brother Stanley followed him to Hollywood, also changed his name to Cortez, and won several awards as a cinematographer. And did you know that Anthony Quinn came to the US illegally, and picked crops, preached on street corners and boxed before becoming a major star?The author writes with an accessible style and great insight. The pictures are wonderful. I'm neither Latino nor a big movie-goer, but I still loved \\"Heroes, Lovers and Others\\" because it is such a lively collage of wonderful stories about America and the rich variety of people who populate it."},{"Title":"Heroes, Lovers, and Others: The Story of Latinos in Hollywood","review":"Rodriguez gets us thinking about the place of Latinos in US feature film from the very beginning to the present and in a sense, it's a book with a happy ending, because after decades of near-invisibility, Latinos and Latinas are becoming highly visible and indeed stars with huge followings. I mean, like it or not, Jennifer Lopez has millions of fans, as does Christina Aguillera. Intriguing are her portraits of Hollywood's Latin stars of days gone by, from the dashing Gilbert Roland to the gay superstar Ramon Novarro, and the answers to trivia questions like Olga San Juan. But she has some facts wrong, and it makes me wonder if even I, a non-Latino, can pick up some mistakes she has made, who knows maybe there are even more I don't know about! In her article on raquel Welch, first of all she deplores the fact that Jo Raquel Tejada was forced to change her name to Welch. She says that \\"Welch was another name in her family.\\" Every fan of Raquel's in fact knows that \\"Welch\\" is the name of Raquel's first husband, and she didn't \\"steal\\" it or anything from some other member of her own family. Rodriguez also claims that Raquel made her screen debut in the call-girl melodrama A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME, when most historians credit her in appearing in the Elvis programmer ROUSTABOUT way before AHINAH. But, all in all you can't go wrong with Rodriguez (except when she goes wrong), and I love her description of Anthony Quinn as having the greatest gift of a screen actor, the ability to make audiences think they have known the character he is playing in any particular picture, that they have known him for a long time. It's a quirky observation, but a valid one, and a valuable one to boot."},{"Title":"Heroes, Lovers, and Others: The Story of Latinos in Hollywood","review":"Just ordered this because my daughter has to write a paper for Spanish class about a famous Latino/a. She was given Raquel Welch as her subject, and there is almost NOTHING to be found about her that doesn't stress her sex symbol status to an extent inappropriate for a school assignment! Even if another reviewer states there are errors in that portion of this book, we apparently have few choices. I am also very disappointed to see--by a quick \\"look inside\\" at the index--that the late, groundbreaking comedian Freddie Prinze and his show \\"Chico and the Man\\" are nowhere mentioned. But there do seem to be a lot of other people I will be interested in reading about, as I have been fascinated with the culture since living in California as a child, right up to minoring in Spanish in college. So maybe this purchase will be worth it. I will probably amend my review to comment on that later."},{"Title":"Heroes, Lovers, and Others: The Story of Latinos in Hollywood","review":"Clara Rodriguez has written a fascinating history of Latino/a actors in an impressively engaging style. I approached this from a film history perspective, but it would be valuable for Latino cultural history as well since Rodriguez doesn't try to seperate the business from the culture.

Brunold keeps spares for when his eye is bloodshot, and this was taken. He suspects it will be planted to implicate him in a crime. Perry figures out a scheme to prevent this. Next Bertha McLane and her brother Harry visit Perry Mason. Harry has embezzled money from Hartley Basset, who \\"makes all sorts of loans\\", and Harry wants to return the money if Perry can arrange it (Chapter II). Perry advises Harry to straighten out his life. In Chapter III Perry meets Hartley Basset and learns of his character. Perry also meets his wife, who is dissatisfied. A midnight telephone call summons Perry; Mrs. Sylvia Basset has trouble at home between Hartley and his son Dick. Hartley drove away after hitting Dick's secret wife Hazel Fenwick. Perry calls the police, then learns of a mysterious man with one eye. A search of the other rooms finds a dead Hartley Basset! When the police search they find two guns. How could that be suicide (Chapter IV)?Sergeant Holcomb questions Perry about his presence (Chapter IV). The police found a third gun carried by Basset. There is another complication: Dick's secret wife did not drive to Perry's office. Peter Brunold is called to Perry's office, and answers questions. Sergeant Holcomb shows up and arrests Brunold for the murder of Hartley Basset (Chapter VI). Perry learns the facts discovered by Paul Drake's investigation (Chapter VII). Bertha and Harry McLane show up; Harry's story about repaying the embezzled money has a problem (Chapter VIII). Perry and Paul use a ruse to talk to Sylvia Basset (Chapter IX).District Attorney Hamilton Burger visits Perry and ask him to produce Hazel Fenwick in 48 hours (Chapter X). In the next chapter we learn the shocking news about Hazel Fenwick! She was married three times before. Perry gets a call from Harry McLane who wants a secret meeting. When Perry goes to the hotel room he finds Harry will never talk to anyone. Peter Brunold's release is a new complication (Chapter XII). The Preliminary Examination begins with a new surprise (Chapter XIV). Then the Reno police catch Paul Drake handing papers to the stand-in hired by Perry Mason. It appears that Perry Mason stumbled, but we know what happened in Chapter XIII. When Thelma Bevins is questioned, Perry must tell all that he found out about the missing Hazel Fenwick. This produces pandemonium in the courtroom, and exonerates Perry from any witness concealment charge (Chapter XVI). Perry explains why he used a double for Hazel Fenwick, and what he hoped to accomplish. It worked as planned (Chapter XVII).In this story Perry Mason often acts as a detective, and certainly plays very close to the foul line. The appearance of a \\"serial murderer\\" in this story is a first (they don't use that term)."},{"Title":"The Case Of The Counterfeit Eye (A Penguin Perry Mason)","review":"I found this Mason mystery to be a notch above the rest. Most Perry Mason mysteries are what I call \\"fair mysteries\\", in that you have a fair chance to solve the crime with the same information the author provides to Mason.In this book you'll learn some interesting information about glass eyes, and have to maneuver through a dizzying cascade of suspects to come to the correct conclusion. Yet the information is all there for you. I don't always solve Perry Mason mysteries before the ending revelation. In this case I did.This book introduced Hamilton Burger, the famous DA foil and fall guy for Perry's amazing proofs. There are some amusing exchanges between Burger and Mason, and Paul Drake gets in some funny licks too. There are even two attempted romantic interludes between Perry and Della Street, each interrupted inconveniently.

It might not be so good as a mystery, but it contains several impressive scenes such as Mason's grandstand play at the court, the sad romance of the client with the counterfeit eye, and the &quot;infiltration operation&quot; of Mason and Drake to the hotel guarded by the police.And it is also notable that Hamilton Burger, the District Attoney of Los Angeles County, Mason's arch-enemy, first appears on the scene. In this book, Burger is described as a respectable opponent who wants to be faithful to his duty. In later books, he gradually becomes an one-track minded, stubborn enemy who wants to get Mason by all means."},{"Title":"The Case Of The Counterfeit Eye (A Penguin Perry Mason)","review":"I love the Perry Mason series, with its fast-paced movement, bizarre twists, and (now) dated atmosphere. But this entry is weak. There are far too many characters, and the plot is extremely convoluted. Perry breaks the law 8 or 9 times without any justification, tarnishing his image of someone who is protecting justice and not just his clients. The result is that it is simply not as enjoyable as the best in the series. To call any of the novels \\"believable\\" would be a stretch, but this one is so far out of bounds that you simply stop taking it seriously. It is the only book in the series that I can remember having to push myself to finish. That is not a good sign for what should be escapist entertainment."},{"Title":"The Case Of The Counterfeit Eye (A Penguin Perry Mason)","review":"Background: The stylistic heritage of the Perry Mason mysteries is the American pulp magazines of the 1920s. In the early Mason mysteries, Perry - a good-looking, broad-shouldered, two-fisted, man of action - is constantly stiff-arming sultry beauties on his way to an explosive encounter that precipitates the book's climactic action sequence. In the opening chapters of these stories, Gardner subjects the reader to assertive passages that Mason is a crusader for justice, a man so action-oriented he is constitutionally incapable of sitting in his office and waiting for a case to come to him or to develop on its own once it has - he has to be out on the street, in the midst of the action, making things happen, always on the offensive, never standing pat or accepting being put on the defensive. These narrative passages - nave, embarrassingly crude \\"character\\" development - pop up throughout the early books, stopping the narrative dead in its tracks, and putting on full display a non-writer's worst characteristic: telling the reader a character's traits instead of showing them through action, dialogue, and use of other of the writer's tools.Rating \\"Ground Rules\\": These flaws, and others so staggeringly obvious that enumerating them is akin to using cannons to take out a flea, occur throughout the Gardner books, and can easily be used (with justification) to trash his work. But for this reader they are a \\"given\\", part of the literary terrain, and are not relevant to my assessment of the Gardner books. In other words, my assessments of the Perry Mason mysteries turn a blind eye to Erle Stanley Gardner's wooden, style-less writing, inept descriptive passages, unrealistic dialogue, and weak characterizations. As I've just noted, as examples of literary style all of Gardner's books, including the Perry Mason series, are all pretty bad. Nonetheless, the Mason stories are a lot of fun, offering intriguing puzzles, nifty legal gymnastics, courtroom pyrotechnics, and lots of action and close calls for Perry and crew. Basically, you have to turn off the literary sensibilities and enjoy the \\"guilty\\" pleasure of a fun read of bad writing. So, my 1-5 star ratings (A, B, C, D, and F) are relative to other books in the Gardner canon, not to other mysteries, and certainly not to literature or general fiction.\\"The Case of the Counterfeit Eye\\": D+A generally weak entry in the Perry Mason series, not even close to such Gardner classics as \\"The Stuttering Bishop\\", \\"The Lame Canary\\", \\"The Substitute Face\\", or \\"The Perjured Parrot\\", to name entries that were published in successive years after 1935, when \\"The Case of the Counterfeit Eye\\" first came out, and when Gardner's fertile imagination was approaching its quirky peak.This somewhat \\"forced\\" and very artificial mystery has an other-worldly, disconnected air, more removed than most mysteries from the real world - like a mystery gimmick that Gardner dreamed up and simply didn't want to pass up turning into a novel-length story. \\"The Counterfeit Eye\\" is his unsatisfying attempt to put the gimmick into story form. Unsatisfying, because it still feels like a gimmick imposed on the situation and characters, forcing them to behave in ways that satisfy the needs of the gimmick, but not the readers' need for a coherent story in which the characters display a modicum of rational behavior, and the police do not exhibit the blinkered stupidity so characteristic of the drawing room mysteries that were so antithetical to the more \\"realistic\\" roots of the pulp mysteries that are the Perry Mason series' progenitors.In \\"The Counterfeit Eye\\" the basic situation that precipitates the murder and its mystery relies on a tangle of coincidences and are unlikely enough on their own, but surpass any possibility of suspended-disbelief when they coincide the way the author forces them to on the fateful night of the murder. And - the most irritating aspect of this story - resolution of the daunting case against Perry's client is achieved by trotting out the most far-fetched coincidence that Gardner has ever had the temerity to use.All in all a far-fetched, disappointing early effort by Gardner in the midst of one of his most creative periods."},{"Title":"Clinical Social Work Practice with the Elderly","review":"This text helped me to understand the behavioral changes that coincide with aging, and specifically helped me to deal with my parents and elderly relatives who are all in their 80's and above.

She is a smart, very funny lady, she can turn a trip to the grocery store into a funny story, she is the type of person you love to sit with and and chat with, but mostly LISTEN to. This is how I felt while reading her &quot;CHAMPEEN&quot;. It is a wonderful story, actually a whole lotta stories in a story, some very funny, some very sad. Being a woman myself, I could relate alot to the main character, TITANIA, both as a woman and as a young girl turning 13. The classic teen-age crush on an older guy, the fantasies of doing something GREAT, like twirling fire in Titania's case-----wanting to be loved and adored by all. Heather, to me, is a master story-teller, who can take everyday ordinary people we encounter and turn them into funny caricatures. For example, Titania's alcoholic father who captures the neighborhood yappy, irritating rat-dog and gives him a bath in their tub, which infuriates Titania's perfect mother, a woman who wants everything and everyone around her to be perfect. And there is the fat preacher who comes to Badin to baptize lost souls in the lake, only to fall into it himself------his speech is a riot, I just loved how she wrote it. I strongly recommend this book for both readers AND writers, as I think Heather is a great writer, a master of words. And I know she is dedicated to her craft, she has written forever, and she has the story-telling genes in her, as her father was a writer, her uncle, her aunt, etc. In closing, I give CHAMPEEN an enormous THUMBS UP, and I am even going to read it again after I am finished with my current book."},{"Title":"Champeen: A Novel","review":"This book is a riveting story of life in a small rural town and the joys and heartbreaks of growing up.

In the past I've read and reviewed Bumgarner's \\"8 days\\" and I am familiar with her writing style. \\"Slipping\\" is the first book I have reviewed in over six months and I can see that Bumgarner's writing skills have advanced to the next level. This book and possiblyeverything from Barri is and will be winners!The author gets into the head of the \\"Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde\\" character ofSeth Berman. He seems like the typical \\"9 to 5\\" banker, and when a seriesof murders are committed in the area, he is not the typical suspect. However, when his alter ego - named Zeus - scratches to the surface, theresults are rarely pleasant. We see that Zeus is not satisfied with his dual residency with Seth Berman and he wants to get out!In this multiple personality thriller, a tenacious cop named Dana Scanlon is determined to solve the murders that have been committed. When Scanlon focuses on Seth/Zeus, she latches on like a ferocious wolverine, and her desire to catch her perpetrator rivals Zeus's desire to kill. As she closes in on Zeus, your heart will race!This is an exciting thrill ride from page one to the exciting climax andunexpected ending. \\"Slipping\\" is an enjoyable piece of literature on manylevels, and a book that you don't want to miss!Reviewed by Tyrone V.

Upon learning that Berman's alter-ego, Zeus, is behind a series of murders, a race begins to wrestle the murderer to justice, while questioning how something like this could happen to one human being.Berman's character is not a study of the human psyche as much as it is an imaginative piece of fiction. Regular psychology is as boring as being a banker, but Bumgarner spices up this character through insight and understanding what makes a reader's skin crawl.As for the lead female character, Bumgarner turns the age-old art of nagging into an artform, as Scanlon is relentless. She serves as the reasoning behind the madness through intelligence and sheer desire.Anybody who wants to own a classic now should buy \\"Slipping.\\" It blows away anything John Grisham has ever done and Koontz is clearly in Bumgarner's sights as the next to fall.

We meet Seth Berman, boring banker, and man with a secret: Lurking inside him is the truly nasty Zeus, an alter ego with the goal of seriously altering Seth's ego, not to mention the bodies of anybody who gets in his way. And they're not alone. There's a real party going on in there as one flies over this cuckoo's nest.Enter Danna Scanlon, cop-who-just-won't-go-away (let's hope Barri keeps Danna around for a few more books.

It is easy to read and very concise.8 of us in all and enjoying it every week"},{"Title":"Great Women In Christian History: 37 Women Who Changed Their World","review":"Being a female pastor can be difficult; I once had another pastor tell me that he believed that my believing I \\"was called of God to be a pastor was like a man telling him that God had told him to have an affair with his secretary\\". The sad thing is that he based this opinion on the same book that I believe gives women the commission to \\"go and tell\\"; the Bible. To be a Christian is to seek to be like Christ, and contrary to the ravages of history and small minds, Jesus never forbade a woman to speak, in fact the first person he commanded to \\"go and tell\\" about his resurrection was a woman, and she was told to go and tell his male disciples. Some argue that this gave them no \\"authority\\" and that true preachers have \\"authority\\" but the truest model of Jesus was not about authority, rather service and love, most specifically loving others as Christ loved us.Kenneth Curtis and Daniel Graves have written a compelling book that chronicles the lives of 37 women who lived out their faith in Christ through their love of others despite the men that sometimes tried to stop them. They faced many obstacles in living out their call, from cultural bias to laws that made them less than full citizens of the nations in which they lived. Yet, they did their work and they changed the world! As Curtis and Graves note they served as \\"martyrs, wives, mothers, educators, missionaries, charitable workers and protesters among other things\\" such as pastors and writers.While this book is certainly inspirational for women it would be wrong to think it has nothing to offer male readers. As the authors say about male readers \\"it will lift their own sights in terms of obedience to God, courage and vision...\\"This 224 page book would be equal company to any book on a historian's shelf, but it is easily readable and accessible for the lay reader with biographies that range from three to eight pages. The dates the women lived range from the 1st century to the 20th and give not only a concise account of their lives, but a fluid account of history in general.Our church is using this book as the basis for a Women's Bible Study and it is has been very well received even by those who would not normally read biographical books."},{"Title":"Irish Voices: An Informal History 1916-1966","review":"This ambitious book may look like another quick hack-writer introducing after a fulsome preface a few hundred pretty photos on the Emerald Isle, the volume to be given as a gift for your host's coffee-table. But, the text dominates nearly all of the 280 pages, the photos admittedly are handsome but for once far too few, and the result surveys the Anglo-Irish decline against the rise of Catholic Ireland. Its wars for independence introduce economic decline, religious triumph, cultural stagnation, and ultimately the slow demise of those 'out in 1916' as the verities of mid-20c Ireland collapse into the consumer-driven, Anglo- American media and market domination that continues past the final date of the book's title.In fact, the 1916-1966 bracket shortens the span of the actual study. Somerville-Large relates sparingly but adroitly his own memories-- born in Dublin 1928 to a gentrified family of Protestant and English background-- into a tale of how his peers and forebears lived, before and after independence for most of the island. He reaches a depth of textural detail that I found refreshing. I have read a lot on this period, but even with subjects as familiar and often-recounted as the Easter Rising, this author manages to offer tellingly and well-chosen details that make this complicated subject fresh and startling at times.For instance, 1 in 3 of those Irish who fought in the Great War died: 50,000. 28 children died in the Rising. 125 of the nearly 1800 insurgents on that Easter Monday came from a single Christian Brothers school in O'Connell St, another 84 from other CBS's. Only five had been educated in Jesuit schools-- most of their graduates could be found fighting on the French front.Later decades reveal more divisions. For every Protestant child put up for adoption in the mid-century, ten families applied for its care. For every ten Catholic children in the same predicament, only one application was submitted. Those in state-run schools for those who did not find homes or parents could wake to hot cocoa--made from shells--in which the worms floated on top as scum, for the boiling water had killed them. Archbishop McQuaid-- an often stereotyped and caricatured figure not easy to love-- sent funds to many poor, including poet Patrick Kavanagh, who admitted he could not have remained in Ireland otherwise in such parlous decades as the constrained 40s and 50s. McQuaid also allowed, in 1947, those of his flock living in still-rationed Dublin to be exempted from the Lenten fast giving up meat; too many were malnourished. Lacking soap and fuel to heat hot water, those in that city's many tenements called the consequent scabies a 'Republican Itch'.A trip by rail during WW2 from Dublin took 23 hours to reach Killarney, a couple of hundred miles away; a cartoon in the humour magazine Dublin Opinion shows a woman being tied to the tracks by a villain. She protests: 'don't leave me here, I'll starve!' Tea sold on the black market during WW2 at rates equal today to 40 pounds per ounce. Bob Geldof's grandmother ran two Belgian dining places in the capital. a A 1960 visitor observed that since 1916 the island's vistas had changed little; such supposedly bucolic bliss to the fact that 'the spell of the land' observed an Englishwoman, 'owes much to the enormous, the subtle and the speculative magic of the unsuccessful'. Somerville-Large wonders if the decline in religious observance has been replaced by 'the spiritual nourishment we gain from looking at paintings'. Growing up at Warrenpoint in the North, Denis O'Donohue, 'like a bird-watcher' at a hundred yards, asserted he could distinguish sectarian allegiances. The Protestants strutted as if they owned the place. Catholics shuffled 'as if they were there on sufferance'.Anti-TB crusading doctor Robert Collis in 1936 noted how Dubliners spoke of their hometown affectionately as 'an old lady'. Visitors admire her distinctive garb, as if of handsome streets and Georgian houses, so 'they smile complacently and feel proud. Lift the hem of her outer silken garment, however, and you will find suppurating ulcers covered by stinking rags, for Dublin has the foulest slums of any town in Europe'.The early Aer Lingus stewardesses were recruited under requirements both for a knowledge of nursing and for how to make a fourth hand for bridge. The London tabloid 'News of the World' although officially banned was read by 14 out of 55 working-class families in a suburban area of 1950 Cork. Nazi intelligence reported how the Irishman 'supports a community founded upon equality for all, but associates with this an extraordinary personal need for independence which easily leads to indiscipline and pugnacity'.An old woman and thiry-three girls died in a locked dormitory in a convent school fire in 1943 Cavan town while the Poor Clares all escaped; 'local opinion' surmised that the sisters had kept the girls under lock and key. Testimony later revealed that the sisters did not want their otherwise fleeing charges to be seen in their nightdresses. Civil servant Brian O'Nolan, aka Flann O'Brien/Myles na gCopaleen, is supposed to have drafted not only a bitter limerick about this tragedy but also the Tribunal of Inquiry's report that had little choice given 'the climate of the day' but to exonerate the sisters.Full of such anecdotes, both inspiring and sobering, this compendium by Somerville-Large extracts from many biographies, memoirs, and histories these vignettes. A few shortcomings from his approach do diminish its impact, however. No notes link his sources to the pages from which citations and paraphrases originated. One cannot track down further with any ease, therefore, the references and contexts in these valuable primary texts. The book does run out of stamina after around the early 1950s; the considerable rigours of life lived in the stress of post-independence Ireland, the \\"Emergency,\\" and the post-war privation seem to have exhausted Somerville-Large's effort.Still, for the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, this depiction of how the Protestants retreated from privilege as the Catholics advanced in power remains gripping, densely detailed, and flows engagingly. Each chapter takes a theme, explores it through recollections, and then segues into the next that examines Ireland from yet another perspective. The narrative, despite its titular dates, staggers in fits and starts past 1966 to end what Se&aacute;n O'Faolain christened a 'dreary Eden' with the death of blind DeValera at 93 in 1975, his requiem mass said by his grandson in Irish and Latin, with not a word of English."},{"Title":"Scenes That Happen: Snapshot Dramatizations about Life in High School","review":"Krell-Oishi's book attempts to fill a much needed void in the world of high-school scene study: the need for brief, interesting scenes which teenagers can relate to and are interested in. Unfortunately, almost all of these scenes completely lack active dramatic conflict. Characters generally talk about problems they are having with offstage unseen characters; those on stage are almost all in agreement. As the subtitle states, these are mere &quot;snapshots&quot; of adolescent life. Accurate, but like the average snapshot, not very interesting. Yes, the writer has a good ear for teen dialogue, but she seems to lack a true affection for young people. The characters tend to be drawn as nothing more than charicatures with simplistic motives. High school kids are complex, and I've yet to meet one who was only shallow, or bitchy, or self-absorbed, as most of Krell-Oishi's characters are. As a drama teacher, I'd recommend others to look elsewhere for good scenes for teens."},{"Title":"Scenes That Happen: Snapshot Dramatizations about Life in High School","review":"No, this is not high drama. But, as slices of life, these scenes are good for young students who are new to the world of acting. As a drama teacher, I use these scenes in my beginning classes as simple scenes that inexperienced performers can tackle and in which they can perfrom well. I would not recommend this book for the advanced acting student, except for some scenes in this book and the sequal, that I actually think are very well written and include a lot of depth. This book also helps by providing some good 3 character scenes that are hard to find."},{"Title":"Scenes That Happen: Snapshot Dramatizations about Life in High School","review":"I agree with others about the blandness of the scenes in this book, but for me, a high school drama teacher (11 Years), that can be a strength at times. One of the most difficult things to get beginning actors to do is take risks. Most of these scenes don't require much of that,and because memorizing the lines, being loud enough, staying open, are still struggles for them, something safe is helpful to many of my students. I wish more of the scenes were comic, that helps bring more out of them as well. But, I have been working with this book for years and have not found anything else that has the right length and style for my students on a repeated basis. Of course I only use this for their first scene, after that we require much more. But has worked for me and they leave alot of room for creative students to expand on what's there, while not intimidating students who are more timid."},{"Title":"Scenes That Happen: Snapshot Dramatizations about Life in High School","review":"I had the unfortunate privilege of reading many of the skits in here, finding them very senseless. Not only do these scenes never happen, but by the end of each short we feel just as we did when it began. Nothing has been accomplished and there never has been that much of a conflict to begin with. The language is too mild, high schoolers do not talk like that. Words and phrases like \\"Oh my God\\" are overused, trust me, high schoolers do have a wider vocabulary than that. I have not read the sequel to this book and do not wish to unless for a good laugh, which is all the first book is good for."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"The strength and effectiveness of a nation's armed forces depends on the supply of petroleum and other raw materials. Pan Eurasian Petroleum wants to get concessions from the Rumanian government, but its plans were exposed by a leftist newspaper and were suspended. PEP will hire an expensive agent to fix this problem. Kenton, an English free-lance journalist, is on a train to Vienna in search of money. A stranger on this train offers him money to carry an envelope across the border from Germany. The author's knowledge of engineering is shown by his comments in Chapter II: \\"vertical borers, milling machines and turret lathes\\", \\"all-geared head, straight bed S.S. and S.C lathe\\". When Kenton goes to the hotel to deliver the envelope, he finds the stranger has been stabbed dead. The envelope contained photographs and military secrets.Kenton was followed, and captured by Colonel Robinson's men. Beaten and threatened unless he surrenders the secret papers. Kenton knew that Big Business pulled the strings of Government statesmen. \\"Follow the money\\" is always the clue to politics. But a near miracle occurs when Andreas appears and frees Kenton. They escape through the woods. During a talk, Andreas explains why Big Business needs somebody like Colonel Robinson: to do their dirty work, and to be expendable if caught (Chapter X). Zaleshoff explains why War Plans are secret, even if prepared for a contingency. Kenton tells them where the secret papers are hidden; but there are problems. Kenton is wanted for the murder, and, masked men stole the envelope with the secret papers. Kenton leaves for Prague. He gets on a tour bus and is befriended by a British salesman, who gives his opinion on western Europeans (Chapter XII).The book describes Kenton's escape across the border into Czechoslovakia. After he arrives by train in Prague, he is escorted away by two plains-clothes policemen. They are Zaleshoff's men. Exciting adventures and events follow. The incriminating secret papers are retrieved, then destroyed. Kenton returns to his post in Berlin by train, but no longer plays poker-dice.

You can compare this story to those of Buchan or Oppenheim."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"Are well foretold that danger lurks within.\\" Henry VI, Part III.When down-on-his-luck British journalist Kenton boarded an Austria-bound train at Nuremberg he likely had no idea what danger lurked within. Strapped for cash after losing virtually all his money in a dice game, Kenton agrees to smuggle an envelope across the Austrian border for an old man claiming to be a refugee from Hitler's Germany. This was the point at which Kenton stumbled at the threshold of danger in Eric Ambler's spy thriller \\"Background to Danger\\".Long before Fleming's James Bond, le Carre's George Smiley and Len Deighton's Harry Palmer there were Eric Ambler's accidental spies. In the late 1930's the loosely defined adventure/spy genre was not much advanced from the earlier works of Erskine Childers (Riddle of the Sands) and John Buchan (Thirty Nine Steps). Typically, Ambler would take an unassuming, unsuspecting spectator and immerse him in a world of mystery and intrigue in pre-World War II Europe, a world of shadows and shades of grey. The result was a series of highly entertaining and satisfying books that many believe set the stage for the likes of Fleming (who read Ambler's \\"A Coffin for Dimitrios\\" while writing \\"From Russia With Love\\") le Carre, Deighton, and, most recently, Alan Furst. \\"Background to Danger\\" is an excellent example of Ambler at work.Kenton's absorption into the world of intrigue begins shortly after taking possession of the documents on the train. It quickly becomes clear that the man is no refugee and the envelope contains documents that foretell danger for anyone unlucky enough to have them. The documents are sought by ruthless interested parties that include Soviet agents (a brother and sister who make appearances in a number of Ambler's books) and industrial spies hired by an English munitions company that belies possession of the documents will enable it to enhance its sales of arms to Eastern Europe. As these parties close in on him Kenton is forced to think on his feet and make life and death decisions about who he can and cannot trust. Kenton knows his life is in danger and he must flea Austria for the relative safety of Czechoslovakia. The story follows Kenton's escape attempt until a climactic scene in which the few remaining loose ends are tied up.As with all his best work Ambler is a great scene-setter. You get a real feel for the many geographic settings he uses as the book progresses. Ambler is also good at character development. His writing is terse and to the point yet the characters nature is revealed slowly and in a non-hackneyed manner. There are no saints or starkly painted devils in Ambler's books but ultimately Ambler's protagonists (and the reader) are provided with enough information to make a choice between good and evil or, sometimes, a hard choice between the lesser of two evils.Background to Danger is an excellent book and makes for a worthy introduction to Ambler's work for anyone not familiar with his work. For fans of Ambler, I'd say this is among the upper end of his stories. They are all good, but I'd say that Background to Danger is close to the top of the heap."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"I'm am surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did! It's not the typical type of story I read. The mysteries I'm used to reading are far more \\"fluffy\\" than this. However, the characters in \\"Background to Danger\\" were so intriguing and - oddly enough, warm - that I found myself sucked into the characters as much as the mystery.I've only given this four stars because, really, of my own personal tastes and lack of knowledge on the countries and foreign relationships the story deals with. I'm sure the book is worthy of 5 stars for anyone who knows more about this era, and is more used to this kind of mystery.Being the squimish person that I am, I was very pleased that the book isn't very graphic. Yes, people get killed, but, happily, Ambler doesn't go into much detail.I also appreciated the good guy/bad guy, somewhat blurred lines of right and wrong... the story presents interesting circumstances that place our protagonists in situations where what would appear to be \\"wrong\\" is, perhaps, actually \\"right.\\" This said, the story focuses on the mystery and the \\"messages\\" aren't overly apparent and really just a subtext for those wishing to seek them.This is a very interesting read and I'd be more than happy to read it again and partake of another Ambler adventure."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"Ambler is often terrific; I would rate &#34;Cause for Alarm&#34;, and &#34;Journey Into Fear&#34; five stars each. &#34;Background . . .&#34; was a bit heavy on the chase, but comparatively light on character development, style, and atmosphere."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"Once again an \\"ordinary man\\" is thrust into extraordinary circumstances. In this case, a freelance newspaper writer (last name Kenton) becomes entangled in an espionage game in the period just before WWII. Kenton has suffered losses at cards and, broke, catches a train out of Germany to Austria, where he hopes to borrow money. A fellow traveler with a strange tale that Kenton doesn't believe asks Kenton to carry some papers across the border for him. Despite misgivings, Kenton is persuaded by a welcome cash payment to accommodate the man. True to form, the papers are photo images of military plans which, in the wrong hands, could cause great harm to the peace. Thus begins a story of murder, deceit, thrilling chases, and improbable escapes. Best of all, we see Kenton evaluating his various responses to these swiftly changing circumstances, finding in himself a courage and resourcefulness that surprises him and those he meets. In the end, he finds himself allied with Communists in opposition to Fascists, not for any political conviction, but because the Fascist faction seeks to do harm and the Communist faction seeks to prevent harm. This is an easy read about a likable character (actually several likable characters)."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"Down-at-the-heels journalist Kenton (if he has a first name, I missed it) is riding the rails through a Central Europe quailing under the ever-tightening fist of Nazi Germany when he meets a squirrelly fellow passenger named Herman Sachs who shares a smelly snausage and offers Kenton a chance to make an easy buck (or pound or mark or euro or whatever): All he's gotta do is stick some papers under his shirt when they cross the next border. Why do noir heroes ALWAYS agree to this??!! Of course, the job goes sour, and Kenton is blamed for murder and entangled in a conspiracy involving Nazis, war-profiteering corporations and Soviet spies. This novel gave me a mental image of something you might see in the middle of the night on TCM: a black-and-white film of sophisticated suspense directed by Alfred Hitchcock or Orson Welles, something filled with shadows and cigarette smoke. In fact, both directors did work with Ambler material, but in digging around the Google, I discovered it was Raoul Walsh who brought \\"Background to Danger\\" to the screen. I'll have to look for it. This is the first Ambler novel I've read, and thanx to Vintage Black Lizard, one of my favorite book imprints, I have a bunch more to look forward to. As spy guys go, Ambler is a much better writer than Ludlum, and he's a lot more fun than LeCarre."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"Everywhere Kenton goes, he seems to have the misfortune of finding a dead body with a knife protruding from its back. The police believe Kenton is responsible for at least one of the deaths, so he is on the run. His only chance to prove his innocence lies in recovering the photographs that a stranger gave him while he was on a train to Austria -- photographs he no longer possesses. Unfortunately for Kenton, at least two adversaries are also determined to find the photographs. As Kenton makes his way from Nuremberg to Linz to Prague, a journey that becomes more desperate by the minute, he tries to puzzle out the relationships between the various parties who are after the photographs. Along the way, he attempts to anticipate their next moves, the better to survive the journey.This formula -- an innocent man caught in a web of intrigue must use his wits to save himself while thwarting the evildoers -- is the sort of thing that Alfred Hitchcock loved to film (Background to Dangerwas, in fact, filmed in 1943, but by Raoul Walsh). Background to Danger has all the hallmarks of a black-and-white Hitchcock film: a brooding atmosphere, a strong sense of place, quirky characters, sharp dialog, and suspense that begins to build from the opening scene. Yet the plot wasn't formulaic when Eric Ambler wrote Background to Danger; Ambler is one of the formula's originators, and writers who subsequently followed the formula have rarely done it better than Ambler.The plot (as we learn in the prologue, it all has to do with oil) is complex without becoming convoluted. Action scenes alternate with chapters that engage the intellect, producing a story that drives forward at a brisk pace without ever becoming mindless. Ambler didn't feel the need to bog down the text with unnecessary verbiage as have so many of his successors; the story is tight. This isn't Eric Ambler's best novel (my favorite so far isA Coffin for Dimitrios) but it is more entertaining than most of the thrillers written in more recent decades. If I could, I would give Background to Danger 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"Background to Danger was first published in 1937 making it one of legendary spymaster Eric Ambler's earliest efforts. In some ways it's a bit of a throwback to even earlier espionage novels such as those authored by John Buchan. Contained within its pages are a number of fantastic exploits that include breakneck chase scenes and last minute escapes from death and danger.Desmond Kenton, the protagonist of this third person narrative, is a British freelance journalist. While on a train traveling from Germany to Austria he is given an envelope by a fellow passenger to hold for safe keeping. Unbeknownst to Kenton, the envelope contains politically sensitive Soviet military information which places him in mortal danger.To fully appreciate the international significance of Background to Danger's storyline, one would have to have a working knowledge of internal Rumanian politics circa 1937. Though Ambler supplies a fair amount of exposition to fill in any gaps the reader might have in this particular area, the motivation behind the actions of many characters remains obscure.Background to Danger rates 3 stars. A worthwhile read for Ambler fans. But he's done much, much better."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"As the second in what would become an impressive progeny of spy novels, Background to Danger (also published asUncommon Danger (Penguin Modern Classics)) is clearly not Ambler's best. In fact, it falls far short of its siblings. Characters come onto the scene too quickly, their many aliases in tow. Their travels, which pivot about a poorly developed political narrative, lead them haphazardly gallivanting about Europe. Each scene is little more than a blur. The narrative itself, besides being poorly developed, is too cynical of capitalism and too sympathetic to communism to resonate with the modern reader.Nevertheless, you can see some promise here, if not some glimpses of Ambler's later and more recognized novelA Coffin for Dimitrios. The villain no doubt is an archetype for Ambler's equally villainous Dimitrios. The story he shadows, though at times too fast and difficult to access, provides the usual escape and some unexpected action. For the most part, the book is enjoyable, but the long-time fan of Ambler will likely find it less appealing than usual."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"One of three of the best novels by Ambler, the others \\"Coffin for Dmitrios\\" and \\"Cause for Alarm.\\" Written in 1937, Ambler weaves a suspensful story about a down on his luck journalist who stumbles into a web of intrigue. I personally enjoy this type of novel; in addition to a good yarn, the background is contemporaneous. It's like stepping into a time machine."},{"Title":"Background to Danger","review":"If you like spy and crime mixed in with war, you will like Eric Ambler paperbacks."},{"Title":"In Search of Your Canadian Roots 3rd ed.","review":"Mr. Baxter starts with the assumption that you know nothing about genealogy and takes you step-by-step in the genealogical process.

He tells you where to write for information, what kind of data you can expect from these places and gives examples of his own Canadian research. Buy this book and you will never be disappointed."},{"Title":"In Search of Your Canadian Roots 3rd ed.","review":"I looked at Mr. Baxter's book at the public library and being a member of the Victoria Genealogical Society I was most interested in his observations on our society. I was shocked at the incredibly inaccurate comments that he had published.The entry starts with the society's name - which he correctly entered. However he then gives the reader an address that is several years out of date. In early 1993 the VGS changed it's address to: Victoria Genealogical Society, P.O Box 45031, Mayfair Postal Outlet, Victoria, BC, V8Z 7G9. Checking in the Genealogical Research Directories (GRD)it was noted that they have published the correct address since their 1993 edition. To cover himself he states that &quot;the addresses given are accurate at the time of writing&quot; but surely Mr. Baxter has access to the GRD.The rest of the article continues with inaccuracy after inaccuracy and it becomes clear that Mr. Baxter has not done any research into the VGS.He states that the society &quot;holds few meetings&quot;. The fact is that for most of our twenty plus years the VGS has held regular, well-attended meetings ten months of the year. No meetings are held in July or August. Meetings always feature a speaker.He states that the VGS &quot;does not appear to have any ongoing projects&quot;. One large project can be seen on the B.C. Archives website, namely the indexes to births, marriages and deaths. These indexes, produced mostly by VGS members, set a standard that other provinces should emulate. He does mention the indexes briefly under the B.C. Archives stating &quot;Please note, the indexes to Birth, Marriage, and Death registrations are located in the Vital Events section of the Web site&quot;. No more details are given to this most useful tool.Among the other ongoing projects are the extraction of details from coroner's reports and the indexing of stones and burial records of Royal Oak Cemetery. So far over 67,000 burial records have been extracted at Royal Oak and all the stones have been recorded. This is a work in progress and will be published in the future.He states that the VGS &quot;produces a Surname Index only at occasional interval&quot;. The last two were produced in 1997 and 1999. The 1997 version was produced on paper and microfiche. The last one is an ongoing surname index and can be viewed on the VGS website. It is being updated regularly.To try and justify his contention that the VGS is &quot;the least active of all the provincial-capital societies&quot; he quotes an un-named and totally un-identified person. This person states that &quot;this lack of activity is caused by the fact that only a handful of our 150 members have any British Columbia or Vancouver Island roots&quot;. We actually have nearly 400 members and are very active.He omits to mention that the VGS has one of the finest genealogical libraries in Canada. He also omits the fact that the VGS has an active and effective queries committee.He fails to mention that the society has hosted two very successful daylong seminars in the last two years. Lady Tiviot, May 1998, and Cindy Howells (of Cindy's List fame), Oct 1999, were the feature guests to the sold out events.What a pity that Mr. Baxter was too lazy to check the VGS website . Why didn't he write a letter to our president asking for comments or find some way to give the society a chance to defend itself against such untrue statements.When writing a fact based book every effort should be made to be thorough, accurate and fair. On just this one page I have been very disappointed to find that a man who produces many genealogy books may be too busy to get the facts right.In his book I was not able to find any comments on the Ontario Cemetery Finding Aid (OCFA) or the British Columbia Cemetery Finding Aid (BCCFA). These are two of the best research tools and are freely available to all but he does seem to know about them. Both are produced by two members of the VGS. He also makes only a passing comment on the extremely important 1871 Ontario Census Index.He seems to think that there is a provincial genealogical society in B.C. In fact the British Columbia Genealogical Society is the Vancouver area genealogical society and has no status as a provincial body and does not claim such a status.I won't read the rest of his book or any other of his books. He has lost my trust."},{"Title":"In Search of Your Canadian Roots 3rd ed.","review":"Gives a great general over view of many Canadian record sources sorted by province.

Suddenly the case she is supposed to be on becomes a backdrop as Rachel pursues hitherto unfollowed clues and inconsistencies through the murky waters of St. Louis politics and the even murkier waters of the porn industry. A lawyer could drown in such waters very easily, but our girl not only stays afloat, she emerges from them triumphant -- and even works out a thorny romantic problem of her own. Read it.

If you've read Coruscant and the Core Worlds then you know the pattern that this sourcebook follows as well. While there are some gaps, players and GM's will probably be slightly more interested in this sourcebook than its older sibling, because as we all know, most of the actual action in the Star Wars universe takes place in the Outer Rim!Let's cover the aesthetics first. As usual, the SWRPG team has given us another attractive book. The image of a Republic gunship blasting its way through the sky is pretty darn cool. Between the covers this book is full-color throughout with a large amount of quality original artwork. There are a handful of photos this time as well. In short, it just feels like a Star Wars sourcebook.On to the content. The book's main focus is on 29 Outer Rim worlds. Each planet receives an overview which includes vital statistics, a basic description, a short history, a description of its people (if any), and a selection of important locations. Each planet also has a GM-only section that includes a few adventure ideas, new NPCs, and any new races, creatures, or equipment. Note that there are no new feats or prestige classes at all. Minor worlds like Roon and Kintan receive an average of 5 pages of attention, while major worlds like Geonosis and Kamino receive 8-11 pages each. Again, keep in mind that each entry is a generous but broad overview, not an exhaustive description.Most worlds, like Bespin, Dathomir, and Ossus have appeared in the movies or novels at some point. Some worlds seem to be brand new. However, three notable worlds are missing entirely: Hoth, Naboo, and Tatooine. Sure, Hoth doesn't have a lot going on, but a page or two would have been nice for the sake of completeness. The authors also explain that Naboo and Tatooine were left out because they already have their own sourcebooks. And they do- but they were (in my opinion) mediocre sourcebooks that are now years out of print. I understand the logic, but it's not an omission I care for. On the other hand, the authors state in the foreward that they may produce a second volume on the Outer Rim if there is sufficient interest. I hope they do.I also found it interesting that the table of contents lists the NPC's, creatures, equipment, and other extras by page number, and not in alphabetical order. That's not a choice that I would have gone with, but everything is still listed by category as well, so locating an entry is still easy enough.As a player, the main thing I like about this sourcebook is how sharply the worlds contrast with each other. That makes for excellent character background material. As a GM, I really liked the adventure hooks. The authors have taken the hooks a step further by linking some of the worlds together for two-part adventure ideas. That was a nice touch.There are also 86 new NPCs (each with a personality and background, and most linked to a specific planet), 15 new species, 10 new pieces of equipment, 10 new vehicles, 1 new starship, 28 new creatures, and 1 new droid. The vast array of new NPCs and creatures in particular seem to provide a wealth of options for roleplaying, combat, or just as a spur for new ideas.And oh yes... there are many maps as well. Compared to previous books, map quality has really improved. The maps are bigger than they have been, and finally, every single one actually has a key! In fact, the map of the Great Temple on Yavin IV takes up a whole page and is perfect for anyone running a Rebellion or New Jedi Order campaign.Overall, despite a few flaws and ommissions, Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds is a good, solid reference. Players will like it for its wide array of background material, and GMs will also appreciate the ready-made worlds, adventure hooks, NPCs, and creatures. In short, this is fertile soil for any campaign that ventures into the Outer Rim."},{"Title":"Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds (Star Wars Roleplaying Game)","review":"Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds (Star Wars Roleplaying Game); it is what it is.

When the William Howland of the Civil War generation died in the Wilderness, the property passed to a brother who dutifully named his heir William. When the William Howland of the First World War Era was called off to war, he never got beyond New Orleans, where the Flu almost killed him. He was the next to last William Howland.Now this William had married and brought his bride back to the family home. She bore him a daughter named Abigail and later a son, named William, of course, but caught a childbirth fever, passed away, and was laid in the family tomb. A year later the boy child was also laid to rest beside her.By the time of the Depression, the Howlands dominated Wade County. William could afford to send Abigail off to a good school, where she fell in love with an Englishman who taught literature and poetry. They were married and had a girl child, also named Abigail. However, the husband refused to stay on the sidelines when World War II started and returned to England to join the fight. Neither Abigail ever saw him again. Later, Abigail contracted tuberculosis and was taken out West to a sanitarium, but to no avail.Shortly after the elder Abigail's wedding, William took a trip into the swamp, fulfilling a foolish bet about finding a moonshine still. After discovering the still, he returned through New Church, a black settlement, mostly descended from the blacks freed by Andy Jackson after the Battle of New Orleans. These freejacks, as they were called, kept to themselves mostly, although they added a little Choctaw blood over the years. When William stopped of at a old baptismal font to get water, he noticed a young black girl washing clothes in the stream. Feeling a need for additional help around the place, he offered her a job if she wanted it. The next day she showed up at his house and took over the odd jobs that had been neglected by the cook.Margaret had ideas of her own. After all, she had walked twenty miles for this job and she admired the look of William Howland. That evening, while William was noisily taking off his boots, Margaret showed up to help and then stayed the night. She bore him five children, three of which lived.Everybody in the county soon knew about William's mistress. Abigail the younger grew up with it and didn't think it so strange. In fact, both Abigails rather liked Margaret. Everything was working out all right as they usually do in those small Southern towns, until Abigail the younger married a politician.This story has some of ambiance of William Faulkner, but much of that goes with the territory. The author gives the sights and smells and sounds of that country so that you feel that you are part of the story. Everything from Alabama country marriages and funerals to the flowers and coon hunts comes alive around you.The story is told from the point of view of William, Margaret and the Abigails. It covers the well-to-do Howlands and the poor-as-dirt Carmichaels, with dozens of others playing their part. It also has some biting commentary about Alabama politics and local prejudices. The ending is bitter, but not without hope.Highly recommended to anyone enjoys stories of the Old South or even who missed the years prior to integration.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Sometimes you come across a book that reminds you why you love your favorite genre. From me, the genre is literary fiction and for me The Keepers of The House is one of those books that reminds me why I am a literary fiction reader.The synopsis of the book is a little misleading. Yes, it is a story of family and tradition but the racial injustice angle is not a major issue. It's more like a reflection of the time and location. This novel spans two generation of the Howland family and their history after they settled in Alabama. The synopsis makes it seem that Abigail and the Howlands are mixed-race. They are not all of the Howlands (including Abigail) are white, there is small a branch of the family that is mixed race and their role in the story is not prominent until the end.The Keeper of The House starts off the the narrator, Abigail, reflecting on how her and her children ended up where they are. To fully understand the Howland family and the county the helped found. She takes the readers on a journey through her colorful and rich family history. A large portion of the story focuses on her grandfather, William Howland, and how he came to father three children by his mistress, Margaret who is black. The second part of the story is Abigail telling the reader about how her grandfather's past ends up effecting her present and the future of herself, her marriage and her children.Grau picked the prefect narrator in Abigail. Her voice was authentic. It was interesting to see how she developed as a person as the time pasted. I just can't say enough about her. I just really liked her and wanted to see how she got to the place in her life she was in when she was introduced in the first chapter. All the characters (good and bad) were well thought out and presented. Now of them were flat. They all had good qualities and bad.The Keepers of The House reminded me a lot of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (which I loved). The difference being that The Keeper of The House is a much smaller book, without all the details that Steinbeck's East of Eden had. But they were both tales of family history, how the started, and how they developed.*****I received this book from the published in exchange for an honest review***"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Enjoyed this book a lot . It gave you insight of how it was in the south back then . The details provided really let you invision what was happening."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"What did I like about this book? Everything.The plot was like a road that ran thru the lives of this family. There were turns and twists. It kept you moving forward to see where the family would end. You could feel things building without the author having to force feed it to you.The characters were well developed and multi-dimensional. Abigail was strong and smart, but had her own insecurities. I like when I can understand the decisions the characters make. I understood Abigail's perspective when she dealt with her grandfather's mixed race children, her husband, even the town's people.The language of the story helped to establish the setting. I am from Louisiana, so I love when writers are able to make me feel the humid, languid beauty of the south.I strongly recommend that anyone who wants a good read, purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The Keepers of the House by Shirley Ann Grau is a hauntingly beautiful book that earned Grau a Pulitzer Prize in 1965. I'm surprised that this novel isn't more well-known as it would make a wonderful book club selection.Following seven generations of Howlands, The Keepers of the House is told mostly through the eyes of Abigail Howland Mason Tolliver. The original William Howland settled in the area after fighting in the Battle of New Orleans with Andrew Jackson. Abigail's grandfather, another William Howland, is a hard-working and prosperous farmer who owns much of the town. His young wife died soon after childbirth and he never remarried, despite the best efforts of his friends and family. When he was 48, he comes across a 17-year old black girl, Margaret Carmichael, and he invites her to work for him. She becomes his mistress and they have three children together. At first, the town seems to know and accept William's black children (who can pass for white). But the rules change when Abigail's husband runs for public office. This sets off a chain of events that will change Abigail's life, as well as the whole future of the town.Grau writes eloquently in The Keepers, when through both black and white eyes. Abigail thinks about her ancestors \\"They are dead, all of them. I am caught and tangled around by their doings. It is as if their lives left a weaving of invisible threads in the air of this house, of this town, of this county. And I stumbled and fell into them.\\" Margaret describes the death and funeral for her great-grandmother. The oldest women \\"Now they were sitting straight-backed in those close-packed rows, hands folded across their chests, rocking their bodies back and forth from the waist, mourning. It was a descending long nasal wail, repeated over and over again, each one exactly like the one before. It was not a hymn. It had no tune; it did not even have a rhythm. No two voices were together. It was only a raggedly picket line of sound to keep the evil spirits away from the dead.\\"For as much as I loved The Keepers of the House, I found that the ending was very unsettling. Without giving away the plot, I was disturbed by the way that Abigail treated Margaret's children and wonder if perhaps the ending might have been different if it was written today. But that ending is what makes this book so haunting and I found that I could not get The Keepers of the House out of my mind."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This was a delicious book - maybe because I read it right after finishing a book that I despised (Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War). Once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.This story is about the forbidden love between William Howland, a wealthy white landowner, and Margaret Carmichael, his black maid, in a small southern town at a time when segregation attempted to keep races separated.I'm a Melungeon (tri-racial heritage) from a predominately white area in WV - and while that's not the south, we do have some lingering confederate sympathizers. This is one of those stories that made me think of my Grandpa, who constantly worried about my school finding out about our heritage and the consequences it could have on my life. I wish I would've found this book fourteen years ago, so I could've read it with him. He, unfortunately, grew up in a world where very few writers broached such topics and had a hard time getting me to understand his fear. This book would have illustrated his point perfectly."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Set in the South this well-crafted book tells story of small town living and scandal. Intimately drawn characters, careful details of daily living, and a severe revenge put it on my list of recommended books."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Having read this book, I think I have a better understanding of race relations in the South, particularly in the middle of this century. All the characters were fully developed, and all of the complexities and subtleties of a family with half black siblings, and the aftermath of that discovery, were handled convincingly. What I did not believe was that one of the siblings who went north and passed for white would risk it all by returning south on a well-publicized visit. Otherwise, I would have given the novel a &quot;9&quot;."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"There are opposing viewpoints about this novel. It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1965. The Klan burned a cross on the author's front lawn after it was published. There is always some truth in fiction, as indicated by the recent revelations about a late U.S. Senator from a southern state, and the discussions about the mistress of President Thomas Jefferson.A prominant white widower, during times of racial segregation, has an affair with a black housekeeper producing three children who are raised with his grand-daughter until they are old enough to send to private boarding schools in the north. He provides for them financially, but does not acknowledge them publicly, although it is well known among the family and others.His grand-daughter marries a man with political aspirations who joins the Klan to further his career. Things go along fine, but the truth will out. People seeking vengence of whatever kind forget where their fortunes lie. And people should remember who owns the county and who pays the bills before throwing stones."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I loved this book! It's about the family that has this house in the deep south and about their lives. There are some racial issues though the family is white. The woman who inheritis the house at the end of the story gets the BEST revenge! It's a wonderfully written book which I fell into and was so sorry to see end."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"So much of this book keeps coming back to mind and I chew on the meaning or the motivation for the character. Good read."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The Keeper of the House is a book about the South After the Civil War but during the time of segregation. It covers the lives of the Howland Family, mostly William, Abigail and Margaret (William's Negro wife who was not officially recognized as a Howland). The Howlands and their eccentric ways (like ordering newspapers from the North and marrying foreigners) lead to some interesting situations. As the story is told by each of the three main characters, it covers the life of William and Margaret. Abigail, having had her fair share of difficulties, finishes the story as an adult.My Thoughts on the BookWhile I enjoyed the book, I only gave it three stars because there were a few things that bothered me. For one thing, the chapters were really long. When I'm reading, I need a place to rest my eyes and I didn't find that in this book. That made it much more difficult for me to concentrate and/or find a stopping point.The style of writing was what I consider heavy in that I sometimes had to read a sentence several times before I could move on. I considered this to be more literary and not a smooth flowing story. It really wasn't my style of book. Besides the heaviness, I thought the book was well written. The characters were developed nicely and you really got a peek into their minds. It was actually like sitting by Grandpa, listening to him telling the stories of his youth. He keeps talking and talking, barely taking a breath.The relationship between William and Margaret was odd to say the least but it seemed to work for the story. Abigail was eccentric in her own way before and after she left to go away to school. I would have to say she was probably my favorite character, particularly at the end.From a Christian perspectiveThere really isn't much to say from a Christian perspective. This was not Christian fiction at all, there was very little mention of God, and when it was it was as an afterthought. There were implied instances of extramarital sex (I don't recall the book mentioning when the two characters were married but it turns out they were), however it was not graphic. Towards the end there is a sad act of senseless violence but again it was not graphic.I would recommend this book for those who like Literary fiction. It reads similar to those types of books."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Shirley Ann Grau returns to a literary theme that has characterized much of southern literature for the last eighty years or so: the legacy of slavery and how this is manifested in the daily life of the American South. Often the literature (principally by white authors) that has emerged deals with a dismaying society created by history, resentment, prejudice and ignorance, and is usually handled with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Things are simply described in black and white with shades of gray almost invisible. It is only with authors such as Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Flannery O'Connor that this society is shown in a more muted, as well as more complex, light. As I began reading this novel, I was thinking that Grau might fit this mold; however, by the book's end I was left with one main reaction: this book could have been so much more.The novel is a generational history of the Howland family, a family that has occupied the same land in south central Alabama (the exact location of the novel is never revealed but all the clues point to this location) from the early nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth. The family suffers through Indian raids and the destructiveness of the Civil War and Reconstruction, but manages, by sheer will and labor, to accumulate wealth and become the most important family of the area. It is on the penultimate generation that Grau focuses: Abigail, the granddaughter of the last of a long line of William Howlands. Abigail's mother (she is also named Abigail) dies when the girl is in her early teens and is raised by her grandfather and Margaret Carmichael, a mulatto housekeeper who has three children by Abigail's grandfather. In a trick of genetics, all three of Margaret's children are born white (except to the eyes of Southern whites who have, in Abigail's words, a \\"talent\\" for spotting signs of Negro blood). You would think that all the ingredients for a mesmerizing story would be at hand for Grau to create a world that would allow her to deal with such important themes as the interactions of a racially mixed family unit within the confines established by white southern traditon.Unfortunately, this is only hinted at and instead Grau spins out a narrative that is replete with political intrigue, violence and revenge that leaves the reader reeling a bit from the unbelievable chain of events that brings the story to a close. She almost completely ignores the loving relationship of her grandfather and Margaret and instead focuses on the difficulties that Margaret's children create in Abigail's life, all of which come across as a bit trivial and quite unconvincing. Grau definitely has talent, and her narrative is told in a very conversational tone, her southern accent almost palpable to the reader. Often the novel meanders (the overly long description of William Howland's search for an illegal still is one such example) and I wish that she could have given her story more focus, and not given in to the impulse to be a bit sensational."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book was so real, its people and environments so brilliantly vivid I was captivated from start to finish.

In the end, I decided that I did. It was really quite a satisfying read and a great story. Though somewhat bleak, I felt it was a true testament to family ties and bonds. I walked away with a real sense of history and rootedness. It's just too bad it had to be accompanied with so much bitterness and revenge. I would recommend this one to anyone who likes Southern stories."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"A story dealing with racism: several generations of the Howland family in the south from around the Civil War period to what seems to be the early 1950s - grandfather loves and bears several children with a back woman - the effects this has on the family.I was amazed this was a Pulitzer prize winner (1965). The writing style is easy and flows much like a light conversation, but it wasn't nearly as descriptive (except for plants and trees) or as powerful a story as I would have expected. I've read many in the same vein that were much better. I wanted more about the characters, and less about the trees and the sky. I didn't feel like I really knew or was connected to most of the characters (except Abigail jr.)...too much space was spent on sentence after sentence of describing peripheral incidents that didn't add much to the story. I did feel like I was getting an accurate birds eye view of the prejudices of the middle to upper white class of the 50s, but I would have liked to have heard the characters speak from their heart...and I couldn't hear it. It felt like a light dusting over of a story, nothing to get your teeth into. I enjoyed the sections of the book that delved more into the intimate parts of the characters or their daily lives, but those sections didn't go deep enough long enough and I finished the book a little disappointed."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I read this book because it won a Pulitzer Prize. That is what brought me to it. I would find myself liking passages at one moment and then not liking the book further along...only to have the cycle repeat itself. The prose, wasn't particularly poignant or poetic...two characteristics that for me make a book truly great and memorable. The storyline is what kept me reading... it was refreshing and for the time period in which the book was published, decidedly relevant. Three characters were given a voice beginning and ending with Abigail. Abigail always seemed like a vague child and an even vaguer woman... I was glad to see the novel end the way it did. Though perhaps it was a bit over the top... at least it would have been in &quot;real&quot; life. I am leaving the book wishing there had been a little more depth to the characters, but also eager to discuss the myriad details that held the book together and struck me as the most interesting."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I've read a few fictions about the south and the black trials.

I wish I had found this book in the late 60s when I wanted so much to read, hear, and talk with whites about this kind of true life story from the south. Shirley Ann Grau brings her characters to life so calmly and clearly. She writes of emotion, yet she hides much emotion, especially through the somewhat vague and underexposed storyteller-granddaugher, Abigail Howland Mason. The writing is so beautiful, and the story is so sorrowful. I left the ending wondering, not why the rage of the small town when racial secrets are discovered, but why the deep bitterness and anger shown by Abigail and her half-black, half-white kin. Yes, the south was - and in some respects remains - a cruel and contented place, and yes, people can be coarse and ugly, but in my heart I longed to see some sign of reconciliation.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fine language and is drawn to the exploration of love and hate, conformists and nonconformists, parents and children, greed and grace from a southern perspective. Ms. Grau deserved the Pulitzer in 1965 and I am glad I found her at last in 2001."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"What a fascinating read!! The Keepers Of The House is a marvelous book that I spent an entire Sunday reading, from cover to cover. It tells the story of William Howland, a wealthy white landowner, and Margaret Carmichael, a black woman who becomes his maid, and the love that they shared, along with the choses and consequences their love would bring. The story is told by William's grandaughter Abigail Howland Mason, in a long line of Abigails. She narrates this tale, William's and Margaret's history, how they met, their children and how they lived. She also tells how years later the marriage of William and Margaret affects her life. Grau tells the story of forbidden love and revenge that is laced with racism extraordinarily well. Even though throughout the book the reader is aware that the narrator is Abigail, it doesn't hinder the essence of William and Margaret. The soul of the characters are exposed. A very well written book. I know of no better way of spending a Sunday!!"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"If you have ever read about life in the south under segretation, you have an idea about how difficult things were for African Americans and how tense things were for whites.Ms. Grau won a Pulitzer for this book in 1965 for her fascinating story of a wealthy family and the scandal that arises when the truth comes out that the founding father was married to his mulatto housekeeper and had children with her after his first wife died.The intense human emotions, the political climate, the social temper and environment is the backdrop to the amazing character development that is the heart of all of Ms Grau's work. Truly one of America's most talented writers- her work deserves notice and study. Her writing style has a lyrical quality, it flows and builds. I find it impossible to put her books down- the quality of the writing, the interesting characters and the intensity of her storytelling is irresistible.The Keepers of the House is a must for anyone who considers themselves a true bibliophile!"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book presents a very interesting insight into Southern values, particulary those related to class and race. I sometimes found the detailed descriptive style to be boring, tedious, and much too wordy. Further, the second part of the book after the main character, Abigail Howland, marries seemed to be presented as a very overdone, too obvious parody of a rich, upscale Southern family; i.e. the ponies for the children, the butler, the pearls, the fur coat...... O.K. I've got the idea- could you tone it down? The difference in style between the somewhat understated first part and overstated second part of the book was disconcerting.But- the insight into Southern values relating to race and class was fascinating. The startling ways in which the emotions (jealousy, revenge, hypocrisy, love, hatred, loyalty, and betrayal ) of the Howland family members were portrayed made it difficult to put the book down. Also, the message of Abigail Howland's enduring strength was inspiring (even if you don't believe in &quot;getting even&quot;). All in all a good book, but stylistically sometimes difficult."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The proses in this book are extraordinary. Grau knows the land, the plants, the animals, the smells and the sensibility of the place she writes about so the reader can feel like s/he is walking down that rural road with her as she describes a place. There is something of a touch of Annie Dillard in Grau --the way she loves the natural world. And then there are the people who inhabit the places she describes...they are shaped by but different from the land that the Howland family inhabits, owns, nurtures and has grown a part of without fanfare or intention. The Howlands are a people who know and remember their history and where they live is part of who they are. As Grau builds this story, she gently introduces us to layer upon layer of the complex mix out of which racism grew and festered and which distorted the world, so that our narrator eventually ends up in the fetal position on the floor trying to fend off, alone the ugliness of a racist society full of people who use each other ruthlessly...a society that turns the narrator herself into a less than perfect character. This is a pulls-no-punches story. It is the kind of book people ought to talk about after they read. It is full of who we are as a nation-and it could help us find our way out of the mess we've made for ourselves."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I saw this book advertised and picked it up from the library.

There are some characters in literature that I find admirable and this book contains several of them. The central characters in this book show great strength and resiliency. The story covers several generations, so it requires a bit of patience on the part of the reader. At one point, I briefly felt that the story was dragging a bit. The ending, however, makes it well worth the read. It is a very thought-provoking book. It certainly deserves the acclaim it has received."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book won a Pulitzer Prize, so one expects fine writing. But would a book about race in the South written more than 40 years ago --- at the time of the I Have a Dream Speech --- seem like more than an historical relic today? With Keepers of the House, the answer is definitely yes.To begin with, Grau's spare, strong prose collects no cobwebs. It reads hard and clear 40 years later and will do so 100 years later. At the same time, she spins out her generational tale languidly and enigmatically. A relatively unimportant event (plot wise) can receive multipage treatment, and a critical event a few sentences. The pacing keeps the reader on her toes.Moreover, though race pervades every portion of the book, it is not a story just about race. It covers much more: love, loss, parent-child relations; male-female relations (almost protofeminist at points); the rural south; whiskey manufacture; coming of age . . . there is a lot in here to grab the heart and the mind, much more than its statement about the destructive power of racial hypocrisy.On the negative side, in its treatment of mixed race offspring and racial passing, the racist caricature of the \\"tragic mulatto\\" makes an appearance. (Check out this link if you are not familiar with the myth of the Tragic Mulatto: www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mulatto). Although the book twists the traditional myth by, apparently, suggesting passing as the better course --- the characters who are set up to pass and stray from that path are condemned for it --- the message that racial mixing leads to tragedy comes through, albeit with the author's regrets.That treatment certainly makes the book anachronistic as a \\"progressive viewpoint,\\" and would understandbly play a role in its lack of prominence today. I would not prescribe it for a high school curriculum. It did not \\"spoil\\" the book for me, however, for two reasons.First, while I \\"rooted\\" for the narrator and cheered for her during times of violent confrontation, I didn't really like her, so that her beliefs came across much less as the message of the book. Instead, she is just another flawed character of the time. Those beliefs are part, but only a part, of what one doesn't like about her. I don't know if she seemed more of a straightforward heroine when the book was written, but she certainly doesn't now.Second, the core of the book is really the love story between the narrator's Grandfather and his housekeeper --- the interracial connection that drives the entire tale. The depiction of that relationship, far from perfect or idealized (though not portrayed either as the product of rape or powerlessness which would have been a real, but different, story) rang so true and was set out with such acceptance that, for me at least, it excused some of the bumps.Finally, I should add that, although the story builds slowly, it does build. By the last quarter or so, I was in \\"can't put it down\\" mode."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I read The Keepers of the House years ago (found it in a used book store), loaned it out and never got it back.

The book of Ecclesiastes explains \\"seasons\\" well which may explain why Grau opened the story and picked out the title from Ecclesiastes 12:3-5. At its very core The Keepers of the House is a story of forbidden love. William Howland was from a family of privileged white land owners who owned most of the county. While returning from a three day swamp journey to locate a whiskey still, William comes upon Margaret Carmicheal a large richly hued Black woman. Margaret is an orphan left with relatives but she spends most of her time alone. Alone and washing clothes is how William Howland found her that day when he walked out of the swamp. They spent the rest of their lives together.William and Margaret had three children together. William's first marriage had produced a daughter, Abigail, whose mother died. Abigail returned to the Howland home after a troubled marriage with her own young daughter, Abigail, our narrator. William and Margaret had that strong, understanding kind of love that didn't require much talking. Margaret and William's children Robert, Nina, and Christine were all sent away when they got of age to \\"pass\\" in northern cities. There was little to no communication from them. Life went on. Abigail married, John Tolliver, and had her own children. They remained on the Howland land. Her husband launched a successful political career built on segregation principles. John Tolliver thought his segregation rhetoric would go no further than the confines of the White Citizen's Councils he spoke to but it seeped out. His rhetoric caused the past to walk right up to their front door.The women characters within this novel stood out the most. They were strong when it mattered but their weaknesses cripppled them. They loved hard and gave up too easy. They were vengeful.The Keepers of the House read like the author was trying to put a story together and not a finished product. Grau can craft a landscape and make you feel like you are standing there but her characters never connected. I didn't feel like the story began until the last hundred pages. The author took us through 40years of wilderness to get to a promised land that was around the corner. I wanted the ending to be great since I had sluggishly made my way through such a dull narrative.

Her only hope for surviving lies with Rick, the guilt driven volunteer fireman whose reckless driving had caused her injuries.--CAROLINA is four short novels about lusty men and women whose flesh wars daily with their spirits. Every tale supplies material that could be adapted for a television mini-series, feature film or opera in the spirit of WEST SIDE STORY or AMAHL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS."},{"Title":"Warlands: Volume 1 Darklyte","review":"The artwork, like everything else about this book, is very generic. The story cobbled together vampires and Record of the Lodoss War, the characters rather uninteresting and cliched (Let's kill people randomly because we are eeevil vampires!!), and even the drawings could have been taken from a dozen other comic books. I didn't find one iota of originality any where between the covers.The tagline is that it is a merger of anime and comics. I'd say it's more a merger of Korean manwha style with Image style comics. The lead character looks exactly like the Crimson comic hero. The dryad/elves like humans with pointy ears. And the same old same old character drawings: older powerful guys are suitably square jawed and heavy browed, an army of vampires all look suitably cross with furrowed brows, peasants have their bushy moustaches, and the main characters will look youngish with more hair.I had to slug through it after the half way point. The plot was ridiculous and overlymelodramatic. And let's not mention very obvious and glaring spelling or grammar issues."},{"Title":"Warlands: Volume 1 Darklyte","review":"Warlands is a great comic series, undoubtedly, the first few comics are a little clumsy, but the series really blows up into an epic fantasy adventure.The idea of an apocalyptic war against legions of vampires isn't a new one, but how its presented in the first few volumes of Warlands is addicting, you really cannot get enough of the action!"},{"Title":"Warlands: Volume 1 Darklyte","review":"All I can say about this book is that it is fantastic - The artwork is great, the storyline builds up well with some good action, but here's the problem: It ends on an almighty cliffhanger and the sequel is no longer available.

The story is different type, but not hard to follow since it uses a lot of elements from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The cast of characters is brought together well, and the Darklyte story is a setting for other Warlands events that happen down the road. Most action is in Volume 2, but this is still worth the money, especially if readers are tired of the typical superhero books. Highly reccomend this one"},{"Title":"Warlands: Volume 1 Darklyte","review":"Starts out slow, but there is something intriguing about this new take on the vampire/elves/knights story.

If you have a little extra pocket money, pick this one up."},{"Title":"Warlands: Volume 1 Darklyte","review":"I agree with the other reviewer on just about everything, and I just want to add this. The darkness of the work is because the villians are vampires and can't do out in sunlight; but, except for that, they don't seem very horrific. I mean their evil and turn everybody into vampires or use them for food etc.; but none of it is shown and I didn't really get a feeling of them being any different from any other baddie out to take over the world. I'm hoping this is all because of story exposition and plot development, and it'll be made clearer in upcoming editions. That said..It was interesting, holds promise, and I give it 4*."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"A complex collection of three stories about women all living in a fictional American town during the segregation era. Melanctha is by far the best of the three short stories, and can be considered a novella. The Good Anna is extremely humorous. I don't think many can appreciate the innovative technique Stein uses, but a great read if you are interested in the Lost Generation."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"I sort of get it that Stein went \\"pedal to the metal\\" to smash all of the writing and stylistic conventions of her time. She wrote about women, the poor, the mundane elements of life that make the bulk of our lives; all that was on the fringe and to the left of center of what was considered important to write about. I get it that this is groundbreaking. Stein and this work should be applauded and recognized as pioneering, experimental and something just plain new. Stein put it out there because other writers were probably too chicken-s_ _ t to try anything new and she said what the hell. She definitely deserves major credit for that but it is still not a good read. It is a wonderful read if you are a reader who is deeply into style and form and theme and can compare and realize just how different it is point by point. If you know what she was trying to do you'll love it otherwise it is pretty boring to read as stories. The writer pyrotechnic are the star and not the stories and characters themselves, so it is not good story telling. Virginia Wolff did it stylistically much better with \\"To the Lighthouse\\" years later, but there might not have been a \\"Too the Lighthouse\\" if first there was no \\"Three Lives\\". Someone had to do it first. Stein was rich and already living outside the \\"normal\\" it did not cost her much to smash conventions. The only things that are conventional though are the stereotypes she uses. Half white and lighter skinned blacks are smarter than darker blacks. College educated blacks speak in fragmented english. Darker black are characterized as lazy and manipulative and mean. Stein used all of her innovation on style and not substance."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"I derived a great deal of pleasure from reading this book. I &quot;became&quot; each of these women. I wanted to live their lives and experience what they were going through. I identified mostly with Lena. I don't think she was as stupid as everyone said - she's a much deeper character that doesn't quite know how to express herself.I wonder if women tend to identify with these characters more? I would love to see these made into a movie.The language was difficult to follow at times. The patterns and rhythms were in the way sometimes, but if you allow yourself to &quot;give in&quot; to it - you'll be fine."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"In &quot;3 Lives,&quot; Gertrude Stein recounts the life stories of three very different women living and dying in the city Bridgepoint. With &quot;The Good Anna,&quot; we learn the story of a German maid, who maintains the homes of various grand ladies throughout her life. She loves taking care of stray dogs and scolding young ladies into what she deems to be their proper stations. She also cultivates a strong friendship with the widow Mrs. Lehntman, the great &quot;romance&quot; of her life. (Though, it's never entirely clear what is meant by &quot;romance:' either a very strong friendship or an actual intimate relationship.)In &quot;Melanctha,&quot; we are related the history of a young black woman, bright and intelligent, who wants to learn more about life and love. She develops relationships with many different men but learns most of what she needs during her &quot;wanderings&quot; with Jane Harden. After a time, she finally decides to settle down and to get &quot;really married&quot; to the right man. She thinks she finds that in Dr. Jeff Campbell, but neither one knows exactly what he/she really wants.In the final story, &quot;The Gentle Lena,&quot; Lena is a young German girl, brought to the States by a cousin. She is considered ugly and dimwitted so no one in her new family really takes to her. All the girls taunt and tease her. Finally, she is et up in an arranged marriage to a man who doesn't really like women (though it's never said flat out whether or not he is gay). They have children, and the husband falls for the children, ignoring Lena completely.All three women wind up alone, forgotten and eventually dead. But, that's not what I really didn't like about this book. Stein's use of language tended to get in the way, so much so that I could never really understand what characters were saying and could never empathize with them. In fact, with &quot;Melanctha,&quot; their constant repetition of names and long-winded sentences that turn around on themselves to regurgitate what was said in the preceding sentences, made the characters seem simple-minded. I never liked any of the characters because I never felt that I was given anything to like. And, if I was, I had trouble discerning it through the tangle of words. I re-read passages many times simply to try to understand what was happening or what a character was feeling/thinking and never really understood. They came across very two-dimensional.I forced myself to finish the book but still would have trouble recommending it, mostly due to the use of language."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"I have been an admirer of Gertrude Stein's work and chose &quot;Three Lives&quot; in good faith. I wound up discarding the book because of the content of the second story in it, entitled: &quot;Melanctha&quot;. The story concerns a woman of African descent. The language and content of the story is racist, blatantly so. Why did the publisher choose THIS volume for its Dover Thrift Edition when something far better could have been selected from Gertrude Stein's vast body of work? (And why did Gertrude Stein write something like this at all?)"},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"This was my first book I read by Gertrude Stein, and frankly, it will probably be my last. Her subject matter is bland and uninteresting. I understand her rejection of conventional prose, and she does have a unique style of writing, but I just don't like it. I can understand and appreciate why she wrote it the way she did, but it barely kept my attention. And her use of stereotypes was extremely blatant."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"Stein's Three Lives, first published in 1909, is one of the easier books of her in terms of language. The third story in it, &quot;Melanctha&quot;, which is an adaption of her earlier &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, has caused much controversy, mainly due to its racist remarks and stereotypical representations of African - Americans. It is what lies beyond this, however, that distinguishes &quot;Melanctha&quot; from 19th C novels and renders it one of the most important works within the Modernist canon. In her typical style of a &quot;continuous present&quot; and her free usage of a pseudo-vernacular she describes the relationship of Melanctha, a mulatta, with Dr. Jefferson Campbell, also a mulatto. Their struggle &quot;to understand&quot; is a battle of different modes of perception and thus connects the book to Stein's most important teacher, William James. Despite its racist depiction of African Americans, this book is a must for all interested in the beginning of Modernism presented by Gertrude Stein."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"This is not a great novella or a set of great short stories but it is a very fascinating use of prose to create drama and intense feelings. Readers expecting to discover another Tolstoy will be very disappointed. Her writing style is very unusual but she does not write great novels. Hemingway and Katherine Porter claim that she influenced their work. She probably did; but, she is a writer's writer presenting unusual structure and prose. She is not a great novelist.Stein published 26 books starting with this collection of three stories in 1909. This is her first book and she self published only 500 hard copies. She had to fight with the publisher to get it published her way. He wanted to make it more conventional. It was not written as a novel aimed at wide popular sales. She was seeking a smaller and a more critical audience.When it was written, she had left Baltimore and was living in Paris on money inherited from her father. She had the luxury of being able to do whatever she wanted. As a result, she bought paintings and wrote experimental fiction.This is a collection of three short stories. This particular book has an excellent introduction by Professor Ann Charters plus it has Q.E.D., which is another very brief collection of short stories and under 50 pages.What is she doing here? She uses very simple characters, stereotypes really, as a vehicle to try out her experimental prose. It is not stream of consciousness - that was made famous by Joyce a few years later - but rather it is repetition of blocks of prose to create mood. She got the idea of repetition from painters who use repetitive brush strokes to create paintings. It sounds like an odd ball idea but it is original and effective.There are three short stories here: The Good Anna, Melanctha, and The Gentle Lena. The first and last are about young German immigrant women and their struggle to control and be controlled, either by men or other women.The most dramatic work and the longest is the over 100 page novella, Melanctha. This describes a very turbulent relationship between a young black doctor and the mixed race, half black, Melanctha, in Bridgeport. They have a conflicted relationship filled with stress. Stein manages to effectively bring the stress to the reader by repeating blocks of their conversations with just slight changes, paragraph to paragraph. After a while the reader feels that they are in the room with the arguing couple.So, is this a great novel? No. But it is a highly original and interesting use of prose to create the intense mood of the story. It is considered by many as a milestone in American literature. Stein was tempted to follow in the tracks set by Henry James, but in the end struck her own unique chord.Of her 26 works, this is the first and one of her four most important works. The other three are Tender Buttons (1914), The Making of Americans (1925), and The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933). The last was a best seller and brought her widespread fame.For a good selection of her works, there is a 736 page collection by Vintage, March 17, 1990, ISBN-10: 0679724648 or ISBN-13: 978-0679724643 which contains all the good Stein works including Melanctha."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"This is an important work of literature. The use of language to tell stories beyond what can typically be told in narrative was radical at the time. Students of early 20th Century American literature, students of gender studies, students of American studies should all be required to read it. Not an uplifting book and certainly not a book to recommend to your friends who spend more time watching TV and going to movies than reading.There is a controversy surrounding the book's central character named Melanctha. It is unfortunate that television dominates culture in this era. It would seem that when a work of literature depicts a black person, a typical reader expects Cliff Huxtable to appear in one of his dandy sweaters to dispense advice to one of his children in DKNY clothing. Or readers of popular literature (books with bumpy covers) become offended when African American characters do not resemble one of Alice Walker's or Alex Haley's romanticized figures.Melanctha is realistic. She is most likely a composite of many of the women with whom Stein came in contact while studying medicine in urban Baltimore. Melanctha's tragedy is that her intellect will go to waste because she is black and because she is a woman. Her sin (to some readers) seems to be that she talks like a black woman from Baltimore at that time would talk. So don't buy this book if you are offended by the way black people acted or German people acted (there is a story about German immigrants, as well) in Baltimore in the early 20th century.If you are a fan of popular literature...Haley, Alice Walker, and the Cosby show are probably more up your alley. If you are interested in a very interesting experimental work from early 20th Century, by a woman who took her appreciation of post-impressionist art and tried to apply it to literature...this is it."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"read the other reviews and youll be surprised by the violent reactions of people to this book. richard wright, black activist and author, praised this book as the &quot;first true representation of an african-american in american literature&quot; and yet another famous activist labeled it &quot;senseless racist drivel&quot;What in the book provokes this controversy?The question is complex. Though Stein in all three stories uses words like &quot;black&quot; and&quot;german&quot; as undeniable stereotypes, there is no denying that these categories get deconstructed by the narrative and the style.If your read books for style, you cant go wrong here. Stein's experimental prose is poetry set to music, exploring all the auditory limits of the english language.There are 3 stories, The Good Anna, Melanctha and The Gentle Lena.The controversy is mainly about the second story. Not that the other stories dont have their issues. Eg: The Gentle Lena is probably one of the weirdest characters you will EVER see in fiction.So, buy this book and treat yourself to some pleasure in the english language!"},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"The trouble with the avant-garde is that they set themselves up to say that anyone who doesn't like what they do is, well, totally square. At the same time, those who convince themselves that they appreciate it in the correct way can lord it over the rest of us naifs.After having heard about this book for years from a dear Stein-devotee pal, I gave it a try. I must say that, not only was I disappointed in the so-called language experimentation, but I was just plain bored. I did not find the characters interesting; I did not get taken into their world view by the stream-of-consciousness writing style that is Stein's trademark; I did not feel like I learned anything. What truly convinced my pal that I am an artistic philistine - and I guess I am in her measure - is that I vastly preferred The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, which was written for a popular audience (this is, clearly written and not with all the obscure and in my view idioitic word play).Oh well, this review will no doubt get many \\"unhelpful\\" votes, but then, at least I looked at it honestly and and naively and gave it the effort an avant-garde classic deserves. NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"Returning to THREE LIVES after several years, I am again reminded of Stein's stylistic innovation and topical audacity. These are stories of working class women, one African American and two whose European heritage is still marked as &quot;ethnic&quot;, who live with modest hopes and even more modest contentment. Watching Stein imagine a narrative voice to these women of spotty education and limited worldview is itself important. This is not the stream-of-consciousness of Joyce or Faulkner, but rather a subject-verb-predicate world of simple people. That Stein can reflect emotional complexity and intellectual anxiety with a style that would seem well-suited to a reading primer speaks not only of her ability, but indeed might undercut the utility of more affected literary devices. Stein is forging into then largely ignored life and so it should come as no suprise that this book doesn't appeal to most. But there is something here that merits our attention"},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"This collection of three novellas is indicative of a major turn in avant-garde of American literature. Gertrude Stein's prose here functions through its lacuna's and omissions; it is minimalist in content, but her command of dialect is truly accomplished. Melanctha is the finest work here-the story of a black woman and her relationship in a society that hates her. Of course Stein has been accused of employing stereotypes-but such a critique fails to really live the text in its complexity. I can't say the other two works are as strong, Stein feels almost restrained in her commitment to the vernacular. Nevertheless, this is a seminal work."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"This may have been a groundbreaking piece of work in speaking in the vernacular of people of the American lower classes, but now it reads as a little stilted and (especially in the case of the middle story, about a black woman who grew up fatherless and who tries to find and make a life with an intellectual man) a little condescending toward her own characters.Clearly, the stories are meticulously crafted; she meant them to be this way. She just never gets inside the minds of her characters, treating them like marionettes on sticks instead of living within them, even for the few dozen pages of each story.I have to admit, I couldn't stop thinking, \\"You know, Henry James would have moved this along by now.\\" That may not be fair, and it's not like these stories are unreadable, not by a long stretch, but they're the literary equivalent of those hour-long documentaries on late night cable news stations: the camera-eye shows more sympathy than empathy, and it's understood from the get-go that a good end isn't really on the table for any of these characters."},{"Title":"Three lives (A Vintage book)","review":"If you like experimental language and can still be surprised by linguistic expressions you thought to be impossible, you have come to the right place - get this book and read \\"Three Lives\\". It is a wonderful collection of short stories about three different women who struggle with life each in their own way, and Gertrude Stein's descriptions express linguistically, what the souls of these girls go through: Torture, boredom, helplessness, violence, love, sexual desire. Has there ever before been such an emotional language? I doubt it. The edition by Mondial (ISBN 978-1595690425 or 1595690425) includes an introduction by \\"enfant terrible\\" Carl Van Vechten, an essayist and photographer, who knew Gertrude Stein very well and delivers an interesting insight into her way of writing (and living) and the history of this book."},{"Title":"The Cocktail Party","review":"This wonderful play is ultimately entertaining while remaining completely unafraid to challengethe audience.

The psychiatrist has replaced him. He is there to listen to secrets, to sort out situations and to propose solutions to human problems. The very few that are worth it can become the saints of today, going to foreign desolate countries and helping people out of their difficulties, fighting poverty and diseases, bringing the christian faith to pagan people, living in suffering and dire hardship. The others are helped to adapt to our society, to be successful in this society without feeling the remorse or the fear that come along with it. They just become adaptable, supple enough to fit in a deeply dishumanized society. The psychiatrist is the go-between for such people.This play is surrealistic and yet perfectly descriptive of reality. It is full of a new type of poetry, his poetry of love and hate, of a new type of drama, his drama of conflict-solving. T. S. Eliot manages to shift from the most superficial bourgeois drama to the deepest and serenest tragedy turned comedy. The path of these people is tragic in a way, but it ends in beauty or at least in harmony.Yet I think T.S. Eliot would have been better inspired if he had gotten away from this bourgeois aristocratic society that is nothing but vain cocktail parties and superfluous appearances.

While I greatly enjoyed \\"Murder in the Cathedral\\", I was not so amused with \\"The Cocktail Party\\".Eliot delves right into the action in Act I, with a small party of guests conversing in Edward Chamberlayne's London flat. Their host is distracted, and after all of the guests leave, he confesses his problem to an unidentified guest, that his wife has just left him. The unidentified guest mysteriously assures him that his wife will return the next day, as indeed she does.

Through his circular questioning and the insights of their friends, he is able to convince the pair to find the answers for their ailments.\\"The Cocktail Party\\" has been reviewed as a tale about the search for the meaning in life. If that is the case, Eliot had few answers, although some interesting questions. This snapshot of 'modern' London life feels cold and one-dimensional on the page; the reader has no sympathy or feeling for any of the characters who are questioning the meaning of their existence.

It's the movie I HEART HUCKABEES.In both, there are ordinary people leading more or less empty lives, and the people they turn to for advice. These advisers have mystical powers or divine connections, but the whole show makes fun not only of the ordinary characters, but of the advisers and how they work as well.THE COCKTAIL PARTY is a more serious play, since Eliot believed in the Anglicanism his advisers dispense, and he even has a martyr as part of his comedy. But both shows use their unique heavenly personages very well and get a lot of laughs out of them. And of course we have to give Eliot credit for inventing this particular approach.There have been divine advisers before, of course, in plays like THE PASSING OF THE THIRD FLOOR BACK or MR.

Julia returns. Celia remains and announces her interest in Edward to him. Julia's call interrupts the discussion. Her spectacles were left in the kitchen.The unidentified guest reappears. He tells Edward he will change his mind, but he is not free to change it. Celia and Peter come again. They say Lavinia telegraphed Julia. Lavinia arrives, knowing nothing about a telegram. Peter is going to California and Celia may be going away.Julia enters and next Alex. Everyone then leaves to accomodate the couple, Edward and Lavinia. Lavinia says she forgot all about the party.

The first half is enjoyable enough: an unusually well-written English drawing-room comedy with serious overtones. The play begins to fall apart with the bizarre sessions of pseudo-psychotherapy in Act 2, and degenerates into overt Christian flag-waving by the final scene.Yet the play is still well worth reading. It is more accessible that Eliot's earlier plays and was a surprise hit on Broadway when it first opened. It is still occasionally revived today; one production featured Nancy Walker in the plum role of Julia, a seemingly scatterbrained older woman. (&quot;Salvation!

The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me.

He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them.

Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I haven't read much of Twain's works, but this is undoubtly the best Twain book I have ever read (Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, jumping frogs...bleurgrht!).

A very fun read too!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I am a true fan of the King Arthor legands and of the writings of Mark Twain, but this novel does not meet up to either things. Basically the writing is not as well done as his other stories like Tom Sawyer and it puts down the whole legand of the Round Table. If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story.

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

Morgan keeps a diary of the events and happenings of what goes on during his crazy adventure at King Arthur's kingdom. Using 19th century technological advancments, Morgan fools everyone into believing that he is a great magician. After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't. The characters were unrealistic; they would not be in the same mood for 5 minutes.

I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010. It did not disappoint. There was all of Twain's wit, great storytelling, and wonderful descriptions of the River that served as a wonderful campanion for our family's trip."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Although it seemed a bit strange to me that Mark Twain detoured away from his usual straight works of fiction to something that is obviously based on fantasy, I am from Connecticut, so I embraced this novel with open arms. What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM. Well, I am twelve, and I thought this book was wonderful. This was my first truly \\"grown up\\" book I've read, mostly sticking to my age level before, but I really liked it. If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels. (nothing wrong with those of course, but there is too much of a good thing...)"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I would probably scream and faint.Regardless, one makes do with what one has readily available.I found the story thought provoking on many levels. In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River. Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such. It is written in typical Mark Twain style - his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book was at first a huge disappointment. I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought. The Yankee observed some very dark and distrubing facts about people. The book was not the most entertaining book, but the insight to humanity makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility. He also points out how the tyranny of England in Arthur's time continued on 1300 years later. The book will make you laugh and will also make you examine the myths that people take as fact today"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title.

He develops England using modern technology. He goes on some expeditions and tries to change everything that was bad in the Medevil times. I did not like the book at all because it was incredibly boring. Most of the book had nothing to do with the main climax. The whole book was filled with completly irelevant and confusing details. There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic. If Hank knew all that he did in the book, he would have probably rivaled Einstien's IQ. There's no way one person could make telephones, gattling guns, revolvers, newspapers, and factories using 6th century tools.

The main characters were Merlin, King Arthur, Clarence and the main character Hank Morgan. I did not like this book. I think the book is very boring because it is hard to understand the complicated text. The way that the text was complicated was Mark Twain was writing how Middle Ages citizens would talk and one of his sentences went like this, &quot;Graddually as the time wore down one annoying fact still borne upon my understanding&quot;. Another reason I don't like this book is that it is to hard to know what is really going on and who is speaking in the book. At one point in this book I had a totaly different picture in my mind then what was happening in the book. I thought that Clarence and not Hank Morgan was going to get hanged and then burned.

He becomes King Arthur's &quot;second-hand&quot; and tries to make the society more modern. He does this by adding schools, a government system, and introducing more modern inventions. I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand. Because it was set in the middle ages, the characters used old-fashioned words like &quot;Lo&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; etc. that i could not understand. Another reason why I would not reccomend this book to anyone is that it went off on differenbt subjects not pertaining to the story-line. Because it went off on weird subjects, I got confused easily and i would have to read parts of the story over-again.

The man attempts to modernize everything. He makes people believe he is a powerful magician by performing simple acts that seem unreal to the people. For example, he blows up a tower by connecting gun powder to a lightning rod during a storm. Amazing....I think not. I thought this book was boring because there are to many unnecessary details. Who cares what each prison cell looks like? One whole chapter was on the prices of food and how they vary from town to town. Another reason I disliked this book is because it was hard to follow. All the different knights names are so hard to remember and its so slow paced that if you put the book down you can't remember what was going on and you're not interested enough to care.

I would only recommend this to someone who has a lot of time on their hands or to someone who likes slow paced books."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee, travels back into time wher King Arthur rules. Needless to say, he goes on an excursion with King Arthur experiencing many events along the way. On the journey he learns lessons of how to be noble and be a knight. My opinion of this book is that it lacks something, something that is entertaining. I do not find it interesting or appealing. Mark Twain uses many details like most books he has written. The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all. I usually get involved in books, but for this book I was utterly oblivious."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Hank Morgan is hit in the head with a crowbar in the 19th century and wakes up int he Middle Ages. He becomes one of the most powerful people in his country, and because of his knowledge of the future, he makes many discoveries for the 6th century. Hank also goes on many journeys like when he discovers America, and after he has lived in America with his wife for a while he comes back to the city he lived at before he moved to America to find only a few people. With those people he goes against all of England.I would not recommend this book to anybody because it was boring and there was too much gore and killing. The book is boring because in the middle of the book fo about 50 pages they are riding on horses to get to this place to save some princesses that have been turned into pigs. Also the book goes on and on about boring sujects, and the few interesting subjects are over in a few pages. This book is too gory, and there is too much killing. There are people that go around killing people for no reason at all, and at one point in the book there are 30,000 dead bodies rotting. In conclusion I did not like this book because there was too much killing and it was boring."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"&quot;A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court&quot; is about Hank Morgan, a man who goes back in time to Camelot, and takes over using his knowledge of the future, and science. I did not like this book at all. It had no description, and I could hardly understand it. It had no description at all. At one point, Hank-the main character-complains that no one ever uses any description. Here is a passage from the book. &quot;Sir Gewaine went a-journeying, and fell upon Sir Kay. He smote Sir Kay down, off his horse. He went farthe and fell upon Sir Galahad. Sir Galahad smote Sir Gewaine with his sword. Then Sir Galahad went further down the road and smote down Sir James.&quot; Everyone in the book talked in either Old English, using words like prithee, thoust, and other confusing words, or they talked in 1800's Yokel Tawk. In conclusion, I think the book was boring with lack of description, and hard to understand. I would recommend this book to skitzefrenics who can't handle good description, or want to be able understand the story."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, is about a man name Hank Morgan who finds himself transported 1,300 years back to the middle ages. He was thought to be a spy and was put in jail, but with the help of a page named Clarence, he convinces everyone that he is a wizard. Throughout the years he invents things we have today, but they didn't have back then. He also educates and helps people of the kingdom and becomes a knight himself. I found the book to be time-consuming and dull because nothing ever eventful happened and the old English they used made it hard to comprehend. They did not have a lot of big events at all. All he did was talk, talk, and talk about what he was going to do. It would have been more stimulating if they described when he was fighting, exploring, or helping others. Another thing that made it boring was that they used old English. It baffled me when they would say &quot;thou are pithy&quot;. You wouldn't know who &quot;thou&quot; was or even what &quot;pithy&quot; meant! You would not like this book if you like mystery or fast pace, and I do not advise reading it any way."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.) This is a classic and it should be familiar to all well-educated individuals."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I home school my daughter and was looking for some works by American authors.

It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I love this book. I had read it before and was glad to get it for free. Mark Twain is the best."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book--at times disjointed, rambling, self-referential, and irreverent--is decades ahead of its time. It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"When you do the \\"Look Inside\\" thing, you'll read \\"This view is of the Mass Market Paperback edition (1983) from Bantam Classics.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse. However, the best part is the contrast between the author's confident early youthful years and the much later, postwar years of bittersweet reminiscence and regret for what has passed, never to return. A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard.

I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else?

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey.

The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period.

I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again.

I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition. A little dissapointed in the amount of time it took to ship."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author, but he makes this a good story anyway. He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his &quot;magic.&quot; Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before. Unfortunately Twain, once again, falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained, but not better off."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book is great. Owning a hard copy of my own, I looked into buying it for my Kindle, but was shocked at the sticker price. It is 7.16 here (as of December 26, 2011), but it can be had for free at Project Gutenberg. Which will I choose for my Kindle? No contest!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&iexcl;s Court&iexcl; is a hilarious story written by Mark Twain. The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books. There are also some great pictures included in the book, from portraits of Mark Twain to pictures of King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book was a required reading for my school for summer. I did not enjoy the book in some parts because I found it to be very confusing and boring. There were some chapters that I found interesting and suspenseful. I would not recommend this book for readers. I think it just gets boring after awhile."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"As always, Mark Twain is a pleasure to read. However, after a while this book sort of lags along. Twain's tale of his post-civil war trip down the river is not interesting enough to take up the space and detail that he devotes to it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, I thought it was one of Twain's worst, and that comes from someone who loves many of Twain's other works. In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters. While this is an amusing tale of a 19th century American attempting to modernize 6th century Britain, I wish I had applied my recreational reading time elsewhere.This paperback printing is difficult to read, too. The words run too close to the spine, requiring me to hold the book flat to read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee Takes A blast from the past. Yea right! this book is extremely long and rarely has any action to keep you awake if I were a book rater I would give this book a two out of ten thumps up . this story takes place in the 6th century and the only good part was when they were going to burn Hank Morgan and to top it off they didn't even burn him because brought his knowledge from current time and fooled King Author by saying if they don't let him go he will shut down the moon but it was acuity a solar eclipse so the moon slowly faded away so they let him free. Honestly I think this book is not for kids our age it's more for adults. Because I couldn't even stay focus it was so boring I started reading other books. This book may be for determined readers but you better keep a cup of coffee near by full because you might fall asleep."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The story is great - back in time and the confusion and parody that happens.

Hank Morgan ,the main character, gets cracked on the head with a crowbar while working in his colt-factory in Hartford, Connecticut. He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation. Although sounding interesting, parts of the novel are written in old English, therefore recommended from high school up. Personally, the book wasn't the best I had ever read. For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life. Sounding like you'll get a blast from the past, I myself only give this book two stars. Although many very strong readers may like the novel, many people may get lost in the book by falling asleep on the pages."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book A CONNECITICUT YANKEE AT KING ARTHUR'S COURT by Mark Twain is very boaring. It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it. Overall I would not reccomend this book as a quick or fun read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it. The only reason to read it would be for school."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It was grat at some parts and boring at others. The end made up for alot of the book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed. This account reads something more like a travelogue.Interspersed through this account are a number of anecdotes and commentaries, covering a various and sundry range of topics, including tall tales, legends, architecture, culture, grammar, mule racing, cockfighting, and Sir Walter Scott's detrimental effect on the American South. One could spend several pages listing the topics Twain covers, but suffice it to say that the majority will be of interest to the discerning modern reader. His tall tales (often related as fact) are particularly good.Twain is just as engaging here as he is in his fiction. He is self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek, and his style is completely endearing. And if a particular topic is not of interest to the reader, well, he moves on quickly enough.Ultimately, Life on the Mississippi is a fascinating read, not only for detailed insight into nineteenth-century life in America, but also for the countless tales Twain relates in his inimitable style."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This review relates to the Heritage 1944 edition...Heritage's Life on the Mississippi features a dusky green slipcase; book is covered in textured green cloth with a riverboat emblem.

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home. Quite accurate!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, a conecticut from the 19th centuries brings modernization into the 5-6th century and seems to change the world at that time. He is named the Boss after making amazing feats and everyone becomes scared of him and in awe. he puts Merlin the magician into shame and the Boss becomes the famous minister of king Arthur and the magician everyone is scared of. Yet, Hank( the connecticut's real name) is not a real magician. He uses his knowledge of the earths reaction and science of the 19 century to perform what seem like miracle and magic to the people of the 5 and 6th century.Hank goes through many things in the 5th century.

They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion.

I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything. But the world my never know."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small. The story is just as classic as always, and to it I give a galaxy of stars. However, to the knuckleheads at Bantam, I have only condemnation. The print is as small as I have ever seen. My thirty-something eyes are still strong, and are aided by glasses, but I find that after a half an hour, I must put the book down. Spend a little more money, and do yourself a favor, and buy a different version of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot. The book made me think, what would the world be like if some one actually did go back in time?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Twain brings up a lot of interesting points which, although not new, may seem so because of the manner and voice he uses to bring them up. Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency... And, hey, you've gotta love Hello-Central!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier. Twain tells the story first-hand and with his unique combination of wit and descriptive narrative. This is truly an American literary classic and a must-read for anyone interested in 19th century America."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The book came very quickly and in perfect condition. I would buy from them again. The packing was perfect and fit in the mail box. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Before I read Life on the Mississippi I always thought a river was a river. Not any more. And doesn't a pilot stand at the wheel and gently guides his craft down and back. Ha. Twain's description of the Mississippi River is a voluptuous exploration of his lifetime love, and of American history as well, and the complexity of it is astounding. There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him. There are scores of scenes like this that make you bust out laughing, and scores more where you choke up at the majesty and tragedy of it all. Magnificent book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The story is classic. In the chapter regarding the burial of a freeman there is a remarkable defense of the Terror during the French Revolution. Worth reading and perhaps even including as a source should you ever chance to write a paper on the beheading of poor king Louis."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I wanted to like this book. I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us? Twain implies not, but I don't know if I'd agree or if I'd attach a greater failing to the man than the idea.(less)"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

And, most of all, for me, it promotes socialism!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book was actually pretty entertaining.

Just as I have come to expect. Thanks"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"How is it a book written 120 years ago can still be so funny? He's just that good. It's true, some pieces of this are dated and, frankly, the facts regarding populations and cargo tonnage and numbers of schools in various towns is not very interesting, but there is only so much of that to put up with. Most of the rest is just pure fun to read. Some of it, laugh-out-loud fun to read. And it comes down not so much to the stories themselves but how Twain tells them with such great wit and perfect turn of phrase. If you like Twain, this is a must."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's-how to describe it?-reminiscences cum travelogue takes you on an expansive tour of the Mississippi river.Twain reveals where he got his nom de plume,tells of his time as a steamboat pilot and compares the pre civil war Mississippi to the progressive America of 1882.In between acts he gives us a preview chapter of his upcoming novel 'Huckleberry Fynn' (though I cant for the life of me recall it in the book, though its a long while since I read it),a few tall tales,statistics of the river and its Towns and would have us believe that his childhood hero was a carpenter who confessed to being a serial killer!I love Mark Twain. As it says in the introduction, this is a great 'hodgepodge' of a book,being statistical journelese one moment,then pure Twain the next,and its this pure Twain that keeps you on board reading even the appendices at the end!Its obvious Twain couldn't stand the twee 'Merry England' novels of Sir Walter Scott,which no doubt he deplored as a boy,but I think he's dragging us into one of his famous exagerations when he blames Scott, not only for the outdated chivelry nonsense that plagued the Southern sensibilities of his day,but also for being the fundamental cause of the civil war!! As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there? Who better to read than Mark Twain?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed. This account reads something more like a travelogue.Interspersed through this account are a number of anecdotes and commentaries, covering a various and sundry range of topics, including tall tales, legends, architecture, culture, grammar, mule racing, cockfighting, and Sir Walter Scott's detrimental effect on the American South. One could spend several pages listing the topics Twain covers, but suffice it to say that the majority will be of interest to the discerning modern reader. His tall tales (often related as fact) are particularly good.Twain is just as engaging here as he is in his fiction. He is self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek, and his style is completely endearing. And if a particular topic is not of interest to the reader, well, he moves on quickly enough.Ultimately, Life on the Mississippi is a fascinating read, not only for detailed insight into nineteenth-century life in America, but also for the countless tales Twain relates in his inimitable style."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"first of all, for those of u who dont know what \\"thou\\" or \\"thee\\" means,they both mean \\"you\\"! and for all of you who say this book is anti-religion, you must fail to understand that the catholic church was a very powerful and disliked back in the middle ages, and he was describing what religion was like back then.and finally for those of you who say that they dont like the 1800's speech,IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE 1800's!do you expect mark twain to write like we would nowadays?just because he writes a book about time traveling doesnt mean he IS a time traveler!This is a very interesting book,describing in detail what it would be like to mix middle ages with the 19th century.would recomend this book to anyone that knows what \\"thee\\" or \\"thou\\" means."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"With each Twain novel I read, I am amazed at how he can be so funny while packing such astute insights about life. This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel. I recommend Tom Sawyer as the place to begin reading Twain, but if you are already a fan then this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I remember I loved reading Tom Sawyer when I was a kid and I continued reading him in college. So when I started reading this, I had high expectations - not disappointed. This story is waaaaay ahead of its time in terms of morality and the social order. There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects. Twain wrote this in 1899 but it sounds like something you would hear from someone a 100 years later. It could just be timeless.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot. I thought that this novel was wonderfully put together. The way Hank instituted 19th century ideals into the 6th century was a perfect way to add pizazz to the novel. Although there were some parts in the novel that were slow and undeveloped, the best parts and the main parts over-shadow those. This novel is one you MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this book, a man named Hank Morgan is transported from the 19th century to the Dark Ages. He lives there for about a decade living a full and exciting life. He gets by using his wits, courage, common sense and 19th century knowledge to survive. A war takes place, and England is left in ruins. Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;. Besides that, this is a great book that you can really get into whether you're 12 or 65."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A brilliant novel. Twain's best, if you ask me. This is abook that has a lot to say, and unlike many books with a lot to say,it says them all without becoming dry or straying from the story. If you don't like this book I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read the book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life.

Still it is worthwhile reading for any Twain fan."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I thought that the book, if taken at face value, was just another so-so medieval tale. I may have thought that Twain was simply trying to relate the way people were in medieval times to the typical 19th &quot;centurian.&quot; However, I realize that Twain must have been well studied in Medieval philosphy and life.

Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

This book was anything but. It's nothing more than a 400 page rant about how evil wealthy people are, in contrast to the inherent goodness of the oppressed poor. He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating. As it stands, anyone looking for a time travel story is going to get little more than a meandering, endless, and plotless leftwing spiel."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Hi everyone! I had to read this book for school and it was torture. I would not ever reccommend this book to anyone. It was soo boring! Mark Twain tried to be funny, but he was not! The chapters droned on and on about boring topics. This is not a lie at all: I fell asleep with the book open on my lap!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A fellow from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut finds himself back in early medieval England, specifically in King Arthur's Court. Our protagonist revolutionizes their society be introducing them to the printing press, the bicycle, and socialism, among other things. The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts.

While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable.

Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed. This account reads something more like a travelogue.Interspersed through this account are a number of anecdotes and commentaries, covering a various and sundry range of topics, including tall tales, legends, architecture, culture, grammar, mule racing, cockfighting, and Sir Walter Scott's detrimental effect on the American South. One could spend several pages listing the topics Twain covers, but suffice it to say that the majority will be of interest to the discerning modern reader. His tall tales (often related as fact) are particularly good.Twain is just as engaging here as he is in his fiction. He is self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek, and his style is completely endearing. And if a particular topic is not of interest to the reader, well, he moves on quickly enough.Ultimately, Life on the Mississippi is a fascinating read, not only for detailed insight into nineteenth-century life in America, but also for the countless tales Twain relates in his inimitable style."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature. The book is a joy to read of a distant day when the steamboat was king of the river!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin. It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past. He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place. The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well. It had a twist to the ending."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A fan of Mark Twain and a fond reader of Prince and the Pauper, I recommend this read for children's classics series. Though not for a supplement read in the classroom, undoubtedly the book is a great read as you meet the characters:Hank Morgan, the Connecticut YankeeClarence, a page who become Hank's right hand manMerlin, the King's magicianKing Arthur, King of EnglandKnights of the Round Table - Sir Launcelet, etc.King's wife, an evil queen Fay, an old abbot, etc.Having spent his boy hood in a town in Mississippi, Mark Twain is one of the America's greatest and most beloved writers. In this book, Hank Morgan wakes to find himself in King Arthur's England. The Yankee uses all his scientific knowledge to be a Chief Minister in the King's Court. He outwits the magician Merlin and gracefully win the kingdom. There are exciting chapters like the Ogre's Castle, The Yankee and the King sold as Slaves, Yankees fight with the knives, in merlin's cave. Was it a dream and did he get back to Connecticut - You got to read the book. Seriously, if there were no video games or the television shows, kids would have loved to read these classics or rathar listen to the adventure tales like these. A good read."},{"Title":"A gift for Tia Rosa","review":"Tia Rosa had a very special friend name Carmela who lived next door.

The essays were on nature, the definition and impact of nature, and instead of vitriolic bashing of human's interaction with nature, Snyder shows that we could live in harmony with our sacred places. I reccommend you read the essays one at a time, and take your time with them. They really make you think about how each culture interacts with the region they are in, and how sometimes we do take our relationship to the wild the wrong way. It is both poetic, and scientific, the perfect education."},{"Title":"Practice of the Wild","review":"Few books about nature excite me; most leave me bored. Snyder's mastery of language and depth of thought create a riveting exploration. I have recommended this book to many people, and all who have read it treasure it."},{"Title":"Practice of the Wild","review":"I use the essays in The Practice of the Wild in some of the classes I teach. Gary Snyder has a profound sense of place, the wilds, and keen heartfelt vision for the possibilities of our human place in the nature of things. His writings inspires us to deepen our own relationship to self, community, and place... especially in the terrain of the wilds. Like his essays in Turtle Island these essays will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Practice of the Wild","review":"to find our way back from complete devastation will require that we listen to those who have known the way home a long time - gary snyder introduces us to that knowledge in these essays - this book will be read as long as there are people who read books as we know them - may that be a very long time."},{"Title":"Practice of the Wild","review":"From the git-go, I've got to tell you: this is a difficult, challenging book. Not because of the thought or content, but because of the loose and sometimes pedantic writing style. Gary Snyder the poet is a different critter than Gary Snyder the essayist. The syntax is awkward - Snyder asks that you jump across the chasms of comprehension with him. So, you make the disconcerting leap, and your comprehension is left hanging, with nothing to really hang on to.Gary Snyder is in the role of prophet, as he talks about a \\"culture of wilderness\\". But he never elucidates on this - I have not a clue what he means by this term, since he doesn't elaborate on this notion. He talks about a return to the \\"commons\\" of historical times - and there is a cogent discussion of this in the essay \\"The Place, the Regions, and the Commons\\". \\"Good, Wild, Sacred\\" and \\"Ancient Forests of the Far West\\" are the other two essays that are fairly lucid.Yet, I've got to say, the other six essays are pedantic and almost incoherent. It is very hard to follow the discursive twists and turns in this writing. Is Snyder trying to impress his fellow professors at UC Davis with his acumen? We have to be lectured at on the etymologies of many words to the point where the narrative momentum gets slack.The thoughts and content seem legitimate; but the writing style is certainly not. His observations are valid; but with non-sequiturs abounding, with generalizations of human history and philosophy tucked into tangents running off to the horizon, the poor reader is left in the quicksands of incomprehension.In all fairness, you might consider taking a pass on this one. I rarely review a 3 star book, prefering to stay on the positive side of things. This one is one of those rarities.Extracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner"},{"Title":"Practice of the Wild","review":"In spite of my passion for this conserving wild places I couldn't finish this book.

My daugther loves to fall asleep to it.It is beautifully read and the accompanying music is excellent. It is around half an hour long or more. It is read three times, the first one is simply read as a story, the second one allows the children to follow it in the book (sounds a bell so the kids know when to turn the page), and the last read which we love, ends with music that my daughter always falls asleep to.

Of course his very un-butch poodle, Josephine does not help matters in the romance department, as Julie just assumes he is gay (and when asked, his response \\"does it matter?\\" all but confirms her suspicions).Mac has a long history with Julie's husband and his corrupt family; he suspects them in the disappearance of his older brother and when he found out her hubby was dirty, he ended up being the one framed and kicked off the force.He tries to resist his attraction, but circumstances throw them together, as she starts to depend on him to do more than investigate her husband's extra-marital activities. And soon discovers that his attention to footwear and choice in pets may not be indicative of his sexuality.Plenty of steam in this one, as well as a lot of plot twists.

Then one rainy day, I came upon this and decided to start reading. TO TRUST A STRANGER proved to be surprisingly fun, despite its silliness at times.Julie Ann Williams has come a long way from a life of poverty. Fresh from her reign as Miss South Carolina, her Cinderella-like life continues when she marries into one of the State's most influential families. But even fairy tales can come to an end as she realizes that Sid is cheating on her. With no one to turn to, she finds a friend in the handsome stranger she meets. With her life in turmoil, Julie finds herself drawn to the man from whom she has gotten more comfort in one night than what her husband has ever given her in the years they have been married. Yet will she be able to deal with the truth about Mac and Sid's history?When his brother Daniel vanished years ago, Mac suspected that Daniel's friend Sid was involved. For a very long time, his goal in life had been to find out what has happened to his older brother. When he became a cop, Mac started searching for the truth. But just when he was starting to get close to it, his perseverance becomes his downfall when he was kicked out of the force. Now after biding his time waiting for the day when he could take revenge on Sid Carlson, it appears that the gods were finally smiling at him in the form of the distraught Mrs. Carlson. But while sleeping with his enemy's wife seemed like a pretty good way to start his revenge, he never foresaw the complication with falling in love with her. And now that her life is also in danger, Mac is determined to keep Julie safe.Although I wasn't overly keen on Julie whose character lacks depth, Mac's character is so likable and I enjoyed the heated banters and steamy encounters between the two. I also had fun reading about Josephine, whose doggy antics had me grinning. Karen Robards has packed this story with action, humor and sensuality, making it a fun and quick read."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesJulie Carlson suspects her husband, Sid, is having an affair and sneaks out one night to follow him. Fortunately for her, her sudden decision to do so saves her from the mysterious man trying to sneak in to the house to kill her. While out on the town tracking Sid she bumps in to \\"Debbie,\\" who is PI Mac McQuarry undercover on a job. He agrees to help her get the goods on sneaky Sid and in the process they uncover a deeper secret then Julie ever anticipated.This one wasn't too bad, but it's not something I'd rush out to buy either. It's a good quick listen at only 4 CDs. I was able to do the whole thing in one day at work. I did like how the hero and heroine met... him dressed up like a drag queen which provided several humorous pages of the heroine thinking he was gay.However, the abridged version seems to cut out much of the deeper anecdotes that would give a better feel for what is happening in the story. As such, some parts feel rushed, and occasionally Julie and Mac's growing relationship feels forced."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"O.K., this book isn't going to be getting any big awards but I liked it.

It sounds complicated but the story has great twists!!! I enjoyed reading this book b/c it was an escape at it's finest - the suspenseful parts had me really creeped out, and it was a great read at night, but the connection between the hero and the heroine were great! Some people felt turned off by her attitude but I actually really enjoyed the tension between their characters. Karen Robards gets an A+++ for great plot twists and steamy tension and an all-around entertaining read!

There are some extremely graphic sensuous scenes -- one went on for three pages straight, never letting up. For those who enjoy these scenes, it's great reading, but for those who don't want to read the raw sensuality in part of this book, you may want to skip a few pages. Still well worth reading."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Julie Carlson has had it.

They also end up in bed, and almost getting killed.I like the humor in this. As weird as this might sound, my favorite character is the poodle, Josephine, Mac's angel-of-a-dog with a slight Dr.-Jekyll-Mr.-Hyde problem. Basically, she's all cute today, then biting a man's leg off tomorrow.I have to say that I don't know what Mac sees in Julie. They go to bed, and then she tells him to forget about it 'cause she's just going through an immature phase? And I got tired of her in the middle of the book. Sure, she had a right to be mad when Mac didn't tell her the truth about important things. But when the guy is trying to make sure you don't get killed, you've gotta give him a hand. She was being so difficult, it was almost silly.But, like other Robards books, the plot was up to par. It twisted enough to keep me guessing, and still had that happy ending. I just couldn't see the falling-in-love part."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"The main problem I had with this book is Julie. She was definitely not the sharpest tack in the box if after 8 years of marriage she hadn't figured out what hubby was like! She was also way too obsessed with her appearance.I loved Mac &amp; the scenes of him in drag were a scream!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Enjoyed this book, and i love Karen Robards writing. I just had a hard time giving it five stars because of the rediculous conclusions Julie (the female star of the book) always came to concerning her life being in danger. Oh, come on! If someone were telling me these things and strange things started to happen to me and my friends around me, wouldn't I take it at least alittle bit seriously?? That part was kind of frustrating to me.That someone could be that dumb! I kept waiting for her to say, Oh, my life is really in danger!! Well, duh!!!!!!!Anyway, aside from that little anoyance the book was well written, and was really suspensful at the end. The romance was few and far between but that is okay. The male character was a Hunk and of course every womans dream come true! This book is worth reading if you like a good mystery, romance book."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"It took Julie eight years to realize that her marriage to Sid Carlson was a sham. Convinced that Sid was cheating on her, she followed him late one night into Charleston's red light district. It wasn't a smart thing to do and she realized this after her car was stolen and she was left in a parking lot of a seedy bar dressed only in her nighties and running shoes. Someone does come to her rescue and that someone is a drag queen named Debbie.Private Investigator Mac McQuarry was on a case--a case that required him to dress as a drag queen. When he encountered Julie Carlson in the parking lot of the bar he just exited, he thought his luck was about to change. Here is the wife of a man he tried to put behind bars when he was on the police force years earlier. His effort cost him his job. Mac is convinced that Sid Carlson is involved with the MOB and knows what happened to his brother, Daniel, who disappeared fifteen years ago. With Julie's help, maybe he would succeed this time investigating Sid.Mac eventually convinces Julie to hire him to tail Sid but soon he becomes her bodyguard because someone is trying to kill her.Robard's latest effort is not as dark as some of her previous novels. In this book, she has left behind the psycho killer in favor of a hit man and instead of having animals tortured she includes a poodle who is bad but adorable.After reading the prologue, I think you will agree that you just have to continue on. The suspense is good; Mac's stint as a drag queen is amusing; the sex is steamy; the pacing is well done. I really enjoyed Mac's character. He is simply loyal and so protective of Julie especially after discovering her life is in danger. He refuses to leave her side and thanks to his vigilance, he saves her life more than once. I have to say that I think this is one of the best romantic suspense books I've read so far this year. I hope you will enjoy it also."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"To Trust a Stranger is my favorite Karen Robards book so far and I have enjoyed her other work as well.I just liked Mac so much from the beginning it added to my enjoyment of the book. A big, masculine guy who is comfortable enough in his own skin to dress in drag in order to spy on a cheating spouse for his client was so funny. He's got this attitude like \\"Yeah, so, I'm in a dress.\\" Then Julie runs into him while out doing her own spying on her husband. She lets Mac help her simply because she's thinking of him as a \\"Girlfriend.\\" Her assumption about Mac's sexual orientation gives her that impression that it's nice to have a man around who will be nothing more than a friend.Of course all that changes as things start coming out into the open. Julie's husband is doing more than cheating and Mac isn't who she thinks he is. Around every corner there is something unexpected popping up and it was an enjoyable read. I first heard the abridged audio of this book and it really didn't do the book justice. It leaned toward the humor and there is much more to the story than that, so I picked up the book and was glad I did.As others have mentioned it's pretty steamy so I like to add that in so you don't pick up this book and then are shocked that it's in there. This book has some definite HEAT coming off of it so be warned.Julie is kind of annoying but for me Mac made up for it by miles and miles. I really like this book and have read it several times now."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This book was so good that I finished it in one sitting. Karen Robards books have always been very good with one exception--sometimes they were a little too gross for me to give a five star rating.

It was a fantastic read and well worth the hardback price."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.

The book is too cutesy and almost fake in the reactions and behavior of the characters - very unrealistic and oddly old fashioned in a current day setting which doesn't sell.I'll really have to read a few chapters before purchasing her next one!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"I read this book in two days and had fun time reading it. Julie Carlson is afraid her husband is having an affair and hires Mac or (Debby) as she called him to spy on him to find out if her assumption is true. After this turn of events everything goes out of control for both of them. But to me my favorite character would have to be Josaphine, Mac's little Toy Poodle. I enjoyed her personality, and spunk,and at the end she jumps in and nearly saves both of their lives by attacking Bast one of the bad guys. I really enjoyed this book and will enjoy reading more of her books. I already have Beachcomber in my List at home waiting for me. I highly recommend this book. Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This book is a bore and you could probably read a few chapters in the beginning, maybe one in the middle and then the last and feel you have completed your read. The story telling reads like a teenage harlequin romance book. Definitely a beach book you could leave in the sand."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"The most god-awful book I've ever read! I am very disappointed. I was a fan of Karen Robards. I didn't run out and buy her books as soon as they were published as I do with some of the other authors I'm fond of, but I did consider her a consistent, fun read. However, this book has thoroughly changed my mind...I grew so frustrated with her attempts at hip-hop, cool, wise-cracking humor in the pathetic dialog, I almost put the book down twice-but, alas, I'd paid money for it and was determined to finish it. If she had told the story straight, without this irritating distraction, it could have been a very good story. What happened to the style she was beginning to forge with her modern-day stories such as: Hunter's Moon, The Senator's Wife, The Midnight Hour, and Paradise County..."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"In between the sex,there was a pretty good story, if you could dig it out. It was one long love story mixed into a mystery."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"I still feel cheated. I brought this book and Whispers at Midnight as a two story volume. I wish I had saved my money. This book never really worked for me on a couple of levels. Number one what are the odds that Julie would run into Mac while he is dressed in drag in a section of town she never frequents? Then for him to be the brother of the man who was killed in the very first chapter (a man who was connected to Sid) was almost enough to send this book hurtling across the room. Number two Mac seemed too wimpy to be a former cop / private investigator. What kind of man allows himself to be bullied by a woman into letting her go along on an assignment? She threatens him with the fact that she could follow him on her own. If she was that stupid to risk her own neck like that I would have said more power to her. He compromised everything he was trying to accomplish by taking her with him. By the time I got halfway through this book I was praying the hitman would actually succeed in killing Julie. This was an awful book and I will never be buying another book by this author."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This was my first time reading Karen Robards. I thought the characters were well developed and that the story had lots of action. The prose is typical of the genre with steamy love scenes and unrealistic plot twists.The heroine was about as deep as a thimble and just plain grating.

It features \\"flames of passion,\\" complete with hot tongues, silky thighs, and solid biceps. Yes, it really is that corny! But if you're looking for a thriller with no redeeming value other than that it's a light, fun read, this is it. The plot itself had lots of twists and turns and while the characters were stereotypes, in a book like this that adds to the charm and fun. My only real complaint about this great trashy novel is the inclusion of Josephine in the most dangerous escapades. It was highly manipulative to put a dog in harm's way like that, and inconsistent, too. If our hero doesn't take Grandma's poodle with him to drag bars, why would he include her on a shootout with a hitman? Instead of putting the pooch in peril, Mac, leave her home!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This is my first Karen Robards book and as a result of reading it, she is now my newest favorite author.

Not fast-paced like my favorite, \\"Heartbreaker,\\" but the main characters are sexy, sassy and downright likable.Robards' contemporary novels far outweigh her historical romances. Each one is a worthy read -- check out \\"Hunter's Moon\\" and \\"Walking After Midnight\\" as well. Several of her stories are set in Kentucky, so it's disconcerting to read about kidnappings, murders, etc., take place in areas so close to home!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This was one fantastic book. I fell in love with Mac. I had to read it in one day because I could not put it down. Get it, you will be happy that you did."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"I for the most part really enjoyed this book. The only problem I had was with Julie being such an airhead.

She believes he's been cheating on her. That night, Mac, dressed as a transvestite, will meet Julie, as her car crashes into his. Coincidentally, Mac is in an investigation business. And, he knows Julie's husband.As Julie has Mac investigate her husband, she will not know Mac's hidden agenda. That agenda will cause problems between them, as both Julie's and Mac's lives are threatened.TO TRUST A STRANGER has one of the best prologues I've ever read. And, the relationship between Julie and Mac is believable, and very tempestuous and sexy. There's some interesting secondary characters, and some really scary bad guys. The story moves very quickly, and made this book a real page-turner. Oh yes, and before I forget, there's a dog, Josephine, who is a real scene-stealer.There's only a couple of things that keep this book from being a 5-star read, for me. The book seemed a little too short, the romantic relationship between Julie and Mac, a little too quick. Still, it's very much worth reading, and maybe rereading."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Suspenseful and sexy, Ms. Robards' read is a thriller with non-stop action providing hours of glued-to-the-pages entertainment.Former South Carolina beauty queen Julie Carlson suspects that her mega-bucks husband, Sid, is cheating on her. As she follows him one night, a farcical set of circumstances leave her clad in skimpy pajamas, stranded in Charleston's red light district without a car and with a transvestite named Debbie as her only companion.Debbie is really Mac McQuarry, a P.I. who went undercover to locate a client's cheating husband. When Mac aids Julie out of the jam she is in, Julie discovers that Debbie is really a man, but she assumes that he is gay. Not bothering to correct her, Mac lets Julie think what she will, adding an element of humor to this intense read as Julie finds herself fantasizing about Debbie aka Mac.Soon, Julie discovers that her life may be in danger, and Mac is probably the only one that she can trust. Swallowing her pride, Julie tries to overlook the fact that Mac omitted the truth about his sexuality and his previous association with Sid. In a heart-stopping race for their lives, Julie and Mac are on the run from the police, the mob, and a hit man. Can they find safety before they both end up dead?Combining the excitement of a mystery with the spice of a romance, Ms. Robards has, once again, firmly established her position in the genre of romantic suspense. And all the characters, most especially Mac and Julie, are so realistically written, thereby increasing the credibility of this read. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Karen Robards latest is a great escape. Think Linda Howard's MR. PERFECT or Janet Evanovich's series with Stephanie Plum. . . What do these books have in common with TO TRUST A STRANGER? Humor! Humor! I love it. Oh, don't worry. You'll get the handsome hero and the beautiful heroine in danger, the bad guys, the steamy sex, etc. But you also get a large does of humor. I love authors whose characters are funny as well as sexy. I'm not sure why this book didn't get a solid 5 stars in the ratings, but I for one urge you to give it a read. A keeper!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"To Trust A Stranger by Karen Robards is absolutely wonderful.This is the first book that I have read by the author. The book is a combination of mystery and romance. It is simply amazing how the author had a seemingly perfect family involved with so many secrets. Julie Carlson and Sid Carlson marriage was based on a lie from the beginning. Julie ended up trusting a total stranger, Mac, who was a private investigator. One of the best parts in this story was about the love for Mac's dog named, Josephine. If you love a good story, you just have to read this book. The reader plans to go back and read Mrs. Robards previous novels. Recommend her to your friends!!!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Many have reviewed the storyline itself so won't go into that except to say this was one truly annoying shallow heroine. All she thinks about is keeping herself beautiful-she's a size 6 and shame on her because she didn't stay a size 2.:( She goes through all these rituals every night to stay beautiful). Even her job is to help other shallow (not all are shallow I'm sure;it's just when they become obsessed with it) beauty queens be beautiful. She really needs to get a life. I think women should exercise and take care of themselves but Julie was ridiculous. How many times through the book we are reminded how beautiful and thin she is. She even turns herself on looking at herself-get real! Then it's interesting that she does everything her mother and husband wants but is just mean and nasty to Mac who is trying to save her life. (do we have a dual personality here?) She begs him to sleep with her and then says hateful things to him afterward-It's a phase?? Did I mention shallow??? And as for Mac using her to get to her husband (a vicious killer)I didn't see a problem. Anyone would do whatever it took to take someone down who had killed a family member. I liked Mac but really could not get into Julie. The only female in the book worth mentioning is Josephine, the poodle.

Julie soon starts to depend on him for comfort & security & they end up having phenomenal sex but are later caught up in a race for survival thanks to Julie's husband, Sid who led to Mac's downfall & had something to do with his brother's death 15 years earlier.

I strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Life is peachy for erstwhile Ms. South Carolina pageant winner Julie Carlson until she discovers her fairy-tale rise from trailer-trash is just a myth fabricated by her husband Sid with his infidelity and hidden agendas. Her trip to catch Sid in flagrante delicto brings her to the unsavoury side of Charleston and meets transgender Debbie who is actually a straight hunk PI Mac McQuarry, disguised to catch an unfaithful husband for his client. He rescues her after some thugs absconded with her Jaguar - and she begins to trust this stranger.Mac, however plans to secretly distill information from Julie about his missing brother Daniel who, he suspects, had been silenced by Sid when he possesses evidence of his drug-dealing business. He ends up fighting his strong attraction to the luscious beauty and protecting her from a hired assassin sent by Sid.Karen Robards's contemporary romance thriller is unabashedly predictable and cluttered with cliches of the genre right from the tall, dark and dangerous knight errant and alpha male to a feisty beauty queen. It is fortunately just as gleefully indulgent as the chemistry between Mac and Julie scorches to a sizzle high with heated banters and humour. The incendiary passion and some terrifying moments of suspense in this book too, is definitely no stranger to any fans of Karen Robards familiar with her work."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"This was a wonderful story. You could really feel the emotions of the characters. My favorite stories are romantic suspense and this is one of the best. I wish that all books were like this where you can't get anything done because you want to see what happens and then when the book is over you are not disappointed."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"I have always liked the few the Karen Robards books which I read in the past, but I was disappointed in this. The plot was good - the murder at the beginning was terrible but an excellent start to what I thought would be a great read.However, things went downhill from there. Mac was gorgeous, but why would he want a very stupid and appearance obsessive woman like Julie? She's a size 6 and HIPPY, for God's sake? Please Ms Robards, do womankind a favour and make your heroines a little less anorexic mminded. And the stupidity of this heroine made me almost toss the book halfway through. To abuse the man who is trying to save your life is ridiculous, to ridicule his sexual performance when you've just had a great time is insulting and to run off into the night when you KNOW there is a killer just waiting out there, purely because you \\"don't trust Mac\\" stretches the credulity too far.I was very very disappointed in this novel with its unlikeable \\"heroine\\" I preferred Josephine, the poodle. She had a lot more common sense."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"The prologue was the best ever [...] Unfortunately, as the book progressed it lost something. I loved the little dog Josephine as many others have mentioned. The dog really added to the story. Mac was a great guy, but I couldn't stand Julie and her fear of being \\"hippy\\" at a size 6! Her whole turmoil over one bite of chocolate was annoying!!! I hated how the author brought it up so much I was feeling guilty. Then telling us Julie was such a good person helping out other disadvantaged woman by occasionally teaching makeup classes at the shelters, Oh please. Mac and Josephine are what made the book worth reading."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Gosh, Karen Robards' plots are interesting, but the problem is her writing is just atrocious, chock full of cliches and, quite simply, unimaginative descriptive writing. Very disappointing; I won't read another."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"I'm a big fan of romance novels and have greatly enjoyed Ms. Robards' books in the past. She's written some truly sexy, enjoyable romance novels. With this one, however, I was consistently bothered by the heroine, who was a truly unappealing person to say the least.The storyline is really fun. When Julie, our heroine, finds herself in a bad marriage and in apparent physical danger, she turns to an outrageous drag-queen she meets in a chance encounter. The hero, Mac, aka \\"Debbie the Drag-Queen,\\" is a quick-witted private investigator who makes the most of his meeting with Julie to pursue Julie's nasty, soon-to-be ex-husband. They join forces, fall in love, and beat the bad guy, who is a really bad guy (at least by romance novel standards).The real problem is Julie herself. A former beauty queen, Julie is beautiful, thin, graceful, thin, charming, thin... did I mention thin? The author is merciless in reminding us how beautiful and skinny our heroine is - she's a size 6. But she used to be a size 2, which leads her mother and her ex to harp on about her food intake (which I guess is supposed to reinforce to readers that her mother is too critical and her ex is a jerk, but since Julie only ever ends up ostensibly agreeing with their criticisms that she's become fat, what was the point?). A couple bites of chocolate here (Julie's \\"secret flaw\\" is her love of chocolate), a slice of pizza there (a paragraph devoted to the \\"a moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips\\" nonsense), and by the end of this book, I was disgusted with the whole enterprise. This was the most bulemia-inducing novel I've read in quite a while. It would have been fine if Julie found redemption and realized she doesn't have to still be a beauty queen to find love. Or if Mac told her he loved her \\"despite\\" her being \\"hippy\\" (at size 6? Could Ms. Robards be serious???). No such luck.I read romance novels because they remind me that chemistry between men and women still exists, and that men can fall in love with women, quirks and all (and vice versa). Such books make me feel good about myself. That's what reading these kinds of books should be all about. This book made me feel bad about myself. Quite frankly, it should come with a warning--Any woman who's ever been concerned about her weight, or worried that men won't love her unless she's thin and beautiful, need not bother. So I'm adding this warning myself--read at your own risk."},{"Title":"To Trust a Stranger","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I keep reading Robards because when she's on, it's fantastic. &lt;u>Nobody's Angel&lt;/u> is my favorite. In this book, well, it just isn't believable. I hardly think a mobster would marry a girl just to get her into bed. Silly. THe cross dressing bit gets old too. Unless this girl is dumber than most, she would have guessed that he was under cover rather than gay a lot sooner. There is one little thing that has been nagging me both in this book and in &lt;u>Paradise County&lt;/u>. She keeps switching styles. It can be and is hot to use more modern language in modern stories. But she can't make up her mind, and keeps slipping into regency verbiage. No modern man suckles a woman's breast \\"like a babe\\" there are other examples as well. This would be strike two, as far as I'm concerned.

Sid's friends probably killed his first wife and Mac's brother, and ruined the latter's police career. Mac uses Julie to get at Sid, but soon realizes that the mob wants him and Julie dead.TO TRUST A STRANGER is an exciting romantic suspense novel that never slows down as Sid and his pals need Julie and Mac dead. Though a taut thriller, the weakness of the plot lies in the intrepid Julie, who remained oblivious for years as to how cruel her spouse was until she decides to investigate his alleged cheating.

Following trends in comtemporary ethics, Battin uses both fictional and factual puzzle cases to introduce and highlight many of the problems which arise when making judgements concerning art. The puzzles are written in such a way that even the philosophically uninitiated can begin to take up and discuss the issues and to feel the tensions inherent in the puzzles.The puzzles cover a wide-range of aesthetic issues including the definition of art, interpretation, and conflicts between art and other values. Each section begins with a discussion of the main issues highlighted in the following cases and some of the ways in which philosophers have tried to resolve the issues presented.I came across this book while searching for a suitable resource to help introduce primary-aged students to philosophical aesthetics, but needed a more active approach that would capture the interest and curiousity of children. The puzzles are constructed in such a way that many can be stripped of their more advanced concepts and adapted for this age group, yet retain much of their force and intrigue.If you are interested in issues in aesthetics or in teaching aesthetics, it is definitely worth looking at this book!"},{"Title":"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook","review":"This was a thought provoking text, easily digestible and not intimidating.

I plan to send this book to a college professor as well, knowing that the thought provoking segments will also be enticing for him to use in his class in Nice, France."},{"Title":"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook","review":"\\"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook\\" is just that, a selection of puzzling cases which raise interesting questions about art and art theory. The book is organized into 6 chapters: Art and Artworks; Beauty, Ugliness and Aesthetic Experience; Meaning and Interpretation; Creativity and Fidelity; Art and Other Values; and Critical Judgment. Each chapter begins with a 10-page introduction and then provides another 10-25 pages of questions, problems, and case studies.The case studies, which are drawn from a wide variety of sources (some previously published and discussed, others not; some real, some fabricated) are the real contribution made by this collection. The questions and issues they raise are both timely and important to any study of aesthetics. A previous reviewer describes the book as a \\"welcome and refreshing departure from the standard approach,\\" but while the book is certainly welcome and refreshing, it's less a departure from the usual literature than a helpful supplement to it (which is how I've used it in my college courses). It's certainly not a stand-alone text. If you don't know art theory, this collection of cases will not teach you much about it--and that's it's only real weakness, since it could have.The introductory discussions to each set of cases are generally well-written and interesting, but without adding much if any length to the text they could have done a better job of introducing and explaining the primary thinkers on each subject, rather than just offering a mostly topical overview to contextualize what follows. In other words, the authors of this otherwise fine text missed a chance (or at least, they didn't take full advantage of the chance) to educate their readers rather than just stimulate their thinking. Hopefully a second edition will correct that missed opportunity, for it would make the book infinitely more helpful to readers unfamiliar with our rich but complicated philosophy of art."},{"Title":"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook","review":"It should be noted that I had to purchase this book (along with one other) for a class I took a few years ago that was the ICAP (Keystone) equivalent for my degree (respectively, illustration). Thankfully, instead of purchasing this from the bookstore on campus (at an outrageous price), I was able to find a copy via Amazon that was much less expensive.Yes, I was required by the guidelines of the class to read this and while it was more interesting than the other text, it was still a far cry from being entertaining or 'good'. Again, I realize that this is a textbook of sorts that many art classes utilize, but that is no excuse for it to be written in such a boring format and make art and the world of aesthetics seem 'boring' to most.I personally would say not to buy this unless you are really dedicated to wanting to learn about aesthetics or because you have to."},{"Title":"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook","review":"My professor introduced this book to us art education majors as a good resource for finding ways to discuss aesthetic decisions with our future students. After working with her copy for one class, I just had to go out and buy a copy of my own.This book gives key examples of types of questions, and provides ways for you to form an opinion on subjects such as whether or not an animal can make art."},{"Title":"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook","review":"This book is a must-have for art teachers who are interested in teaching aesthetics but are not sure how to talk about it with students. This book offers many scenarios (puzzles) involving aesthetic questions. They are thought-provoking and are sure to enliven many classroom debates. It also includes short and to-the-point explanation of aesthetic theories and the most common aesthetic questions."},{"Title":"Puzzles about Art: An Aesthetics Casebook","review":"If you want to teach aesthetics in art to any age, this is the book for you. The individual puzzles are interesting for students to discuss."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"This is a superlative, well-crafted horror story with quite an original storyline. Taking place in foggy, old England, a dense, yellowish fog suddenly arises from the bowels of the earth, infiltrating the minds of all whom it envelops and removing all restraint. Suddenly, formerly sane individuals find themselves acting as if they were beings out of Dante's Inferno. It is a disaster from which there is seemingly no end.As the fog moves from place to place, it leaves in its wake a swath of grisly devastation, as murder, rape, mass suicide, and looting become a way of life. Even animals succumb to the fog, which turns treasured pets into killers that their owners cannot control. Only one man has managed to emerge with his sanity still intact, and a group of scientists in an underground laboratory are laboring to find out the reason for his seeming immunity. For in him lies the secret to the fog's destruction and the liberation of mankind from the effects of the fog. Time, however, is of the essence and is running out.This is really a terrific novel, well-paced, tautly written, and totally absorbing. It is an absolute page turner, with scenes of horror written in a spare, no nonsense, matter of fact style, making it all the more believable and horrific, all while tinged by a trace of dark humor. The tension is crisply maintained throughout the entire book from start to finish, which makes for a riveting read that is hard to put down. This is a must read for all those who love a good horror story. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"This is a superlative, well crafted horror story with a quite original storyline.

McBrien of the writings of the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson pours forth brilliant light upon the present attempt at rapprochement between the two Christian observances, as the present Pope opens a door to its discontented.Bishop Robinson was best known in his day for the widely popular treatiseHonest to God, which sparked much theological discussion, as reported inTHE HONEST TO GOD DEBATE - SOME REACTIONS TO THE BOOK BY THE SAME TITLE, WITH A NEW CHAPT. BY ITS AUTHOR, J.A.T. ROBINSON. SCM. 1963.Bishop Robinson beginning in 1945 contributed several articles to theological journals and published several more specialized theological works up to the date of the Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien's dissertation, all of which are carefully considered in this book, after a lot of international library search in a paper-based age long before the internet was invented.We read with great interest therefore this doctoral dissertation, excised and revised for general publication, by the great anglo American Roman Catholic theologian, the Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien who proceeds from this firm foundation to one of the most serviceable and brilliant academic and pastoral careers in our Church upon these shores, including not only writing or editing several of the standard reference works in use in Catholic libraries throughout the nation (see for instance hisThe HarperCollins Encyclopaedia of Catholicismand hisLives of the Saints: From Mary and Francis of Assisi to John XXIII and Mother Teresaand hisLives of the Popes - reissue: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to Benedict XVI) but also publishing with a popular and engaging but never watered down content his well-regarded and widely followed column Essays in Theology, which this week is dedicated to a fully biographical obituary for the great theologian the Reverend Father Edward Schillebeeckx, author of both essential textsJesus: An Experiment in ChristologyandChrist: The Experience of Jesus as Lord. The Reverend FAther Richard P. McBrien has also served the Church in a long and brilliant career as professor of theology at the pre-eminent Roman Catholic institute of Higher Education, Notre Dame University.This revised doctoral dissertation by the Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien reveals the promising beginning in all of its fullness. Coming from a dissertation need not discourage us from its careful study, as its revision makes it accessible to any reader with some basic familiarity with the terminology and methodology. The Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien's great gift these four decades has been to make the most obscure theological considerations available to the general reader, particularly through is weekly column. Here he makes the writings of this great Anglican bishop palatable and understandable to the Catholic reader, and reveals the underlying unity of considerations, of terminology, even of belief. The Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien carefully shows us how the work of Bishop John Robinson reveals the truth of our Faith as mission.I find it impossible here to summarize briefly the scope of this book without doing it grave injustice. Within this book the Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien heroically summarizes and analyzes these writings of the Bishop in the light of its sources and influences, and its significance for Roman Catholic theology. We do very well to revisit here the depth and the discipline of the academic rigor with which our theology once was done, in order to reawaken from this present wandering slumber like Dante at the beginning of theLa Divina Comedia Inferno.Briefly this book is divided into two parts, plus introducing and concluding materials with bibliography. The two main sections are The Nature of the Church and the Mission of the Church, Bishop Robinson's main area of concern.In the conclusion, the Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien writes: \\"In this time of change and crisis it is absolutely imperative that the question of the nature and mission of the Church be clearly and boldly confronted. Bishop Robinson is to be commended for his unequivocal insistence that ecclesiology is impossible without an eschatology, that the Church must always subject herself to the demands of the Kingdom.And he is to be commended in a particular manner for dramatizing and developing the rich insights of Deitrich Bonhoeffer with regard to the notion of the Servant Church in a newly secularized world. In a sense, Robinson is a 'high-church' version of Bonhoeffer (p. 151).\\"Those unfamiliar with him might profit from a close introductory reading ofA Testament to Freedom: The Essential Writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Those unfamiliar with this Bishop of Woolwich can do little better than to read carefully this brilliant dissertation from the Reverend Father Richard P. McBrien."},{"Title":"Twice Alive: A Spiritual Guide to Mothering Through Pregnancy and the Child's First Year","review":"Subject: Twice Alive Book review/Boulder Daily CameraBy Carlotta Mast, For the CameraApril 10, 2005Twice Alive: A Spiritual Guide to Mothering Through Pregnancy and the Child's First Year by Beth Osnes. WovenWord Press, 186 pp. $17.50.Since being greeted by that little blue line on a home pregnancy test 2 1/2 years ago, I've soaked up just about every book on motherhood I could get my hands on. I've spent the wee hours of the morning, which is when my son has the hardest time sleeping and usually wants to nurse, devouring everything from practical parenting tomes such as \\"The Baby Book\\" by Dr. William Sears to more political fare, including Ann Crittenden's \\"The Price of Motherhood\\" and, most recently, Judith Warner's \\"Perfect Madness: Motherhood While these books delve into important issues facing mothers from whether to co-sleep and how long to breast feed to the guilt, anxiety and regret that can suffocate today's American mothers each left me feeling like something was missing.But for me, \\"Twice Alive: A Spiritual Guide to Mothering Through Pregnancy and the Child's First Year\\" by Boulder mother and writer Beth Osnes filled this void. More than a practical pregnancy and parenting book, \\"Twice Alive\\" transcends the realities and complications of motherhood to focus on the personal, spiritual effects of creating, raising and loving another human being.In the spirit of \\"Operating Instructions,\\" Anne Lamott's funny and honest account of mothering her infant son, Osnes uses the journal she kept during her pregnancy and first year with her daughter Melisande to give voice to the spiritual gifts of pregnancy and early parenthood. Like Lamott, Osnes doesn't sugarcoat the experience. From the ravages of morning sickness, which Osnes says can make a woman feel \\"like biting the head off of a dog,\\" to her pleas with God to help her new baby fall asleep so she can get some shut-eye, Osnes makes room for the unpleasant and, at times, overwhelming, emotions and sensations that accompany creating and caring for a new baby.Yet, she does not dwell on the negative. Rather, Osnes peels back the layers of her own expectations and fears to reveal the spiritual essence of motherhood in its purest, rawest form. In one passage, Osnes describes the existential wonder that permeates her pregnancy: \\"Who is leading this child by its new budding hand,\\" she writes, \\"drawing the human form out of a miracle of cells and life energy?\\"Later, as she prepares for birth, Osnes reflects on the more surreal realities of her situation: \\"I walk my walk and talk my talk and do my mundane, daily chores, all with another human being's head wedged upside-down in my pelvis.\\"Along with Osnes's own experiences, \\"Twice Alive\\" provides tools to help women reap the greatest benefits from their own spiritual journey through pregnancy, birth and motherhood. The book, for instance, offers advice on how to design a baby shower. The focus is not on choosing the right party games or appetizers, but on creating a ceremony that will celebrate and honor the \\"genuine majesty\\" of this time in a woman's life.\\"With no malice inten(ded),\\" Osnes writes, \\"baby showers propagate a commercialism that belittles and makes 'cute' the birthing experience. You, brave mother, are just the gal to usher in a more soul-nourishing tradition. As with any foray from the status quo, it takes a concerted effort and a bit of spirited courage to travel new and richer ground.\\"While \\"Twice Alive\\" is focused on the individual experience, it reaches at times beyond the personal to explore the need for mothers to share their values and work together to have them represented in government policies and corporate practices. It is in these moments that Osnes's own activism shines through. Osnes is a founding member of Mothers Acting Up, a movement aimed at mobilizing mothers to ensure the health, education and safety of all children, and her convictions and ideas for accomplishing this important feat make reading \\"Twice Alive\\" an even richer experience.But in perhaps the most inspiring and moving passages of \\"Twice Alive,\\" Osnes uses the story of her own mothering decisions from asking her older brother and his wife to raise her first son, Ben, a child born when Osnes was in college and not ready for motherhood, to allowing herself to fall in love with a daughter she had not yet been granted permission by the South African government to adopt to communicate the difficult yet crucial choices all mothers must make.It was through these experiences that Osnes reaches her conclusions: Motherhood is a precious, powerful and potentially fleeting gift, one that should be cherished and supported by both women and the societies around them. Such a message is particularly important in an age where women are frequently criticized for being less-than-perfect mothers, yet are often not provided the resources necessary such as affordable health care, flexible work options or adequate paid family leave to care for their children.Osnes invites us, as mothers, to honor and love ourselves and to use our combined political voice to make the job of mothering easier for women everywhere. That makes \\"Twice Alive\\" a welcome and important addition to the growing canon of literature on parenting and motherhood.Carlotta Mast is a mother and writer living in Boulder.in the Age of Anxiety.\\""},{"Title":"Twice Alive: A Spiritual Guide to Mothering Through Pregnancy and the Child's First Year","review":"This book is truly like no other. Part biography, part political manifesto but always provocative and sensitive. Even though Twice Alive's subtitle suggests something along the lines of a 'self-help' book, Beth Osnes writes viscerally and passionately of the human experience beyond that of motherhood. Her prose is thick with energy and frequently becomes lyrical on a huge variety of topics.The perspectives of this book gives counterpoint to the current American trend of self-absorbed competitive (\\"Baby Einstein\\"-style) parenting and focuses instead on the richness of the child parent relationship with all of its doubts, confusions and beauty. Much of Twice Alive reads like high comedy and will elicit knowing laughs from parents while it alleviates much of the stress from the shoulders of the parent to be."},{"Title":"The Ohio (Rivers of America Series)","review":"We bought and read this book the winter before we traveled the entire length of the Ohio River by car. We traveled from the Point at Pittsburgh to Cairo. We stayed as close as possible to the Ohio River on older roads. The book really helped us appreciate our trip down river. It provided no only relatively recent history but from Indian times too. We had the book along as we traveled and would refer to it now and then.Even if you do not travel the Ohio River, you will find this book interesting, The Ohio truly was a Pioneer Interstate of the time."},{"Title":"Mosby's Handbook of Herbs & Supplements and Their Therapeutic Uses","review":"About a year ago I bought this book & I can honestly say it's one of my most used books. It's very scientific & yet you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what it is saying. The first part of the book deals with different disorders such as ADHD, Diabetes, Hepatitis, Arthritis, & much more. Under the different disorders it gives different examples of what people have tried to treat them with. Then it proceeds to different scientific tests that either proves or disproves the treatment.The second part of the book deals with herbs & their therapeutic uses. Again here different uses & tests are provided for each herb. This book also discussed dosage recommendations, safety issues, drug interactions, & great references to other material. Overall this is a very useful book. The copy that I purchased contains over 1,000 pages & it covers everything from migraine headaches to the various vitamins. I recommend this book not only to the med student but to the average person just wanting useful & real information about herbs and their therapeutic uses."},{"Title":"Mosby's Handbook of Herbs & Supplements and Their Therapeutic Uses","review":"This book is a useful tool for traditional physicians. Many of our patients are wondering what else is there to use without using \\"medicine\\". The book rates various alternative therapies as 3+ evidence based, vs 0 or -1 as no evidence based. There is also some info on toxicity and drug reactions. The book has individual sections on various medical conditions such as Hepatitis and what alternatives are available with the rating system. There is also specific info on the products including dosage, and route of administration. This books seems more user friendly compared to the PDR version on herbals."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"With this warm turbulent relationship between three sisters and a 'dreamer' father, Barbara Freethy takes us through the past loves, broken dreams and shattered hopes of three girls struggling to womanhood, and the bond of 'family' who are prepared to give up on their own lives to protect a family member.

What made this book totally enjoyable was the intrigue that was so cleverly mixed into the love stories portrayed. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Ms. Freethy never fails to provide a richly woven story, and with SUMMER SECRETS, she's reached a new plateau. This multi-faceted tale of love, family loyalty and deadly secrets is set against the challenges of blue water yacht racing, a backdrop that keeps your pulse pounding as clues to what really happened on that ill-fated voyage so many years ago are perilously uncovered, one by one.

I am not \\"into\\" sailing and know nothing about it, but Ms Freethy created a splendid and exciting plot based around the sport.The suspense is well maintained. The author allows hints and details to slowly seep out, drawing the reader deeper into the story. I didn't guess what happened the night of the big storm - and I am pretty good at working out who or what the secret is - so I was delighted to read a book which kept me in the dark. The characters were believable and the tragedy behind the journalist's quest for the truth is well handled. I was pleased that the ending was satisfactory without too much drama - but I don't give spoilers!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Secrets are intreging, and I do have a few. If you have secrets, you know how difficult it is to hide them. One false truth, diversion, or omission leads to another. The stakes are high for the McKenna family when a reporter comes to the island. He hides behind false truths to unlock the secret that will protect his brother and daughter. He finds more than he ever expected as their story unravels. Barbara Freethy does not disappoint. This one was a read-in-the-dark gem!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I'd honestly give this half a star if it was available. My apologies to the author, but personally I just wasn't into this book. It's one of the first ones I've read where I couldn't wait to finish. And I didn't even finish it before giving up (I was halfway through). After awhile I got tired of Tyler seeming like any other guy out there that just wants one thing from a girl, but then also acts like he really cares for Kate and wants to make a home where she is. And the fact that they go on... and on.... and on... about the 'secret' that the family is keeping from the world that happened that one summer but not telling us what it is, was getting old. They could have cut the story in half, told us the secret, and be done with it. At this point I don't even care what secret the family is holding in, I'm deleting this book from my Kindle and moving onto better books (the more expensive books are better and worth every penny!)."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Highly Recommended!Kate, Caroline and Ashley were interesting characters, I love this story about sisters and secrets! So fun to read, and hard to guess the secret! I enjoyed Tyler's character, strong and sexy! Freethy is a great writer, fun to read!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This is my first review and first book read by Barbara Freethy. I can usually tell within the first few pages if I am going to like a book and this one proved my initial impression true. One could easily identify with the characters...real true to life with struggles of their own. The storyline was captivating. Freethy did a spectacular job at weaving individual stories into a larger story that all came together effortlessly. I had a difficult time putting the book down. I was very impressed with the book at this Kindle price. I am definitely going to purchase books from this author again."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I am a fan of Barbara Freethy's books and this one did not disappoint.

A lot to be learned from the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Summer Secrets was so much fun to read. It has a little bit of everything,family, love, friendships, humor, mystery and adventure. I was thrilled to read a story that had so much dimension to it. There's a lot of depth to this book. I really appreciate how well written it is! Can't wait to read more of Ms. Freethy's books."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Sorry, but this one put me to sleep within 2 pages every night. It was slow and disappointing. I usually just keep reading, but with this ended up deleting it before I was 20% into the book."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This could have been interesting, but it just dragged on and on. The parts of the story that could have been excitig---the sailing race and huge storm, were told in snippets or not really at all. The main characters were flat and kind of dull stereotypes. The drunken father they supported and lied for despite the fact that he pretty much tried to ruin their lives and had a tendency to try and get the men they love killed was way too over the top.The ending was predictable and tied up too quickly. Perhaps the author could have spent more on the \\"before\\" and the ending instead of stretching the middle in such a long boring manner. This was NOT a mystery/suspense, but rather a romance with \\"secrets\\" told in a very predictable manner. There were some inconsistencies that made it hard to appreciate where the story was going, and the poor editing was distracting."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I was hoping for a good mystery and instead this novel was a romance cloaked in the genre of a mystery. Yuck!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I found this story to be implausible on many levels. It's hard to imagine that a seemingly smart, strong, and savy woman with a secret, that if revealed, would devastate her family, would allow herself to become involved with a reporter determined to uncover the truth, just because he was so good looking. I don't want to say what else I found hard to believe, because to do so would give away too much of the plot. Suffice it to say that the ending was not plausible."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Started out with some degree of interest and suspense, but halfway through seemed to be stuck going nowhere.

Very satisfied with seller."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I picked this up because it was suggested to me from Amazon. I do not know why. This is not at all my type of book. I like a romance the caliber of Nicholas Sparks ok, but this was just way too \\"simple\\". Some of the actions by the characters were, well, very out of character. Shallow characters and an expected plot.

I keep watching the percentage go up bc Im looking forward to the end."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I wanted to love this book. I have read other books by Barbara Freethy which were moving and exciting page turners. But Summer Secrets did nothing but fizzle my hopes for a good summer read. A bunch of middle age former high school BFFS, and an entitled spoiled teenager take off on an yacht adventure. Anything that could go wrong does. It wouldn't be a tale at sea without the unbelievable clash with pirates. I would have found the book more enjoyable if all of the characters were kidnapped and lost at sea. It was no summer picnic getting through this novel. It is way too predictable and boring."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I read all kinds of things - and read a lot. This is one of the few books I'm not even going to finish. The editing errors, problems with punctuation and continuity are distracting...and it's an easy book to get distracted from because it's just not believable. It reads like an amateur's work. I don't get how this has gotten such good reviews - I bought on the spur of the moment because of an Amazon suggestion (via Kindle)."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This book was cheap and had good reviews and high stars for a summer read. I am sorry but it was so poorly written, predictable and honestly, it was just stupid--even for a summer beach bag read. The author aged herself by poorly capturing her young characters. Eye rolling over the sexual angst that once again makes the author seem to be a generation or two behind the time. Will be more careful when buying books based on amazon reviews. Not worth the time or money."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I do not like nor read romance novels. I bought this, and read it, but this is not my favourite. It is a romance novel, with everything that genre implies."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This was a delightful read. It took a number of twists and turns and kept me engaged in the story. Having sisters myself, I really enjoyed the interaction between the girls.Of course, I loved the ending!!!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Any Barbara Freethy book is worth the read, but this one was especially interesting. Give me a setting by the sea, add in boats and I am happy; add to that the excitement of a race; let the underdogs win and what more can one want. The problem is that the race was in the past and there seem to be secrets left from those days that no one wishes to air. Add an inquisitive reporter and sooner or later the truth will out! Wonderful character development and a plot that keeps throwing unexpected curves."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Just started to read Barbara Freethy books since purchasing my kindle. Each story has some type of moral behind the plot. Characters are people that you as the reader can relate to."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It kept my interest especially not knowing who was the one who had the secret to keep. I would also like to think that women can also be masters of the sea and were able to enter a race and do as well as men."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This book was really good. I am a sailor and can relate to thus book,I think that added to some if the enjoyment. I couldn't put the book down, it is so full of great twists and turns, many emotions, drama and romance . I would recommend thus book to anyone... especially women... who sail. Hope you'll read it and fall in love,like I did."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Did not care for this book at all! Had a hard time even giving it one star, after reading first chapter, only need to read last chapter to of read the whole contents of book! Was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I thought this book was very good. It was well written and the characters were so real.I've enjoyed alot of Barbara Freethy's books. This is one of the better ones!!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This book had me riveted to my Kindle. I could NOT stop reading it. Loved the storyline, characters.Barb keep writing good books and I will keep reading them. I am downloading everything she writes."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I have ordered and received 7 of Barbara Freethy\\"s books and have read 4 of them already and each if them has been terrific. Each of her books has a good plot and interesting characters. I sincerely hope she keeps writing. I really like this first book of a duo. I am looking forward to reading the second one."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"First time reading a Freethy novel. Story line is interesting enough and the biggest secrets stayed unrevealed until near the end. Reminiscent of the old \\"Love Boat\\" shows where people fell in love and even got engaged on a 1 week cruise, two main characters \\"fall in love\\" and have on-the-page sexual encounters but \\"don't know each other well enough\\" to talk about marriage! Um. Ok. For those who care: a smattering of 4 letter words and at least one use of Jesus's name as a swear word."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I have not read Freethy before but found her writing style easy and enjoyable. The story developed the characters and the setting well however I would have found it more interesting if greater sailing detailing was given. Overall I feel that the messy lives that we all can have were warmly depicted in this family's story."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This is the first Barbara Freethy book Ive read and I loved it. It has mystery,family drama and romance. I like long books with humor so this was enjoyable.I so glad I found a new author to explore and will continue to read her books. Summer Secrets was a good introduction."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This was my first Barbara Freethy book. I did enjoy it. I found the setting refreshing and the backdrop of ocean sailing different and interesting. There were some things that I thought could have been improved. The father was Australian, but I never got that vibe. I'd like to have him shown as more Australian, or refer to Australia when he was in a scene. I felt Kate and Tyler's relationship a bit unbelievable at times and the 'secret' dragged on far too long.But as a whole I thought it was a good story."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Once again Barbara Freethy does a flawless job of weaving together family drama, romance, and mysterious secrets that will keep you guessing until the final chapter."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I loved this story. I literally had to FORCE myself to put the Kindle down. I was in suspence the whole book. usually I can pinpoint the Whos Wheres and Whats rpetty quickly, this story had me comepletely unsure! Loved it!!! You fall in love and cheer them on!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I love a good romance and I love a well written story. This book offers both. I really liked the setting and often felt like I was on vacation. I like when a book makes me feel like I've escaped. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I enjoyed this book as a lighter read than I would normally would. I have not read this author before, but thankyou for suggestong her. I have also read her Golden Lies, a very similar light entertaining story with love and mystery, great tale."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I loved this book. I kinda wish it was more about Ashley and Sean and less Kate and Tyler but it was amazing! I never would have guessed the ending. I did think it was sad that everyone sacrificed their lives to protect the family's secrets but I guess I can understand that. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"It started pretty good and kept my interest but as time went on became quite predictable and thought it would never end. Started skimming just to get finished. I don't consider that a \\"good book\\"."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This was a most intelligent and enthralling story; not only intriguing, but sensual as well. All characters were well-thought out and interesting. From the very first, when Tyler appears on the scene, the story and romance grabs you. There was one fascinating plot after another, and I found myself half-crazed to know the secrets, and to see how Tyler and Kate got together, along with Sean and Ashley. And to find out whose baby it was and what became of Jeremy. I have been reading romance/suspense for a number of years and Ms. Freethy has become an addition to list of my best authors."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I purchased this book because it was #1 on the NY Times E-Books Best Seller list; it then became apparent why best seller does not always equate to great book.The book is about a sailing family who won a round the world race 8 years prior to the beginning of the book. During the race something terrible happened (the Summer Secret) and now a curious reporter has come to uncover these secrets they've been successful at hiding for all these years.The thing that really worked about this book, I felt, was the pacing. I think Ms.Freethy did a great job of letting out little hints as to the secret along the way without revealing too much. The story itself was pretty good too; she never made it completely obvious what had happened, so finding out the end was satisfying.The thing that absolutely did not work in this book was the writing and characterization. It is very easy to just lay it all out on the page when it comes to describing a character and not leave any guesswork to your reader, this is exactly the literary crime Ms. Freethy committed in this book. I think an author should trust the reader to understand what they're trying to say about the character through dialogue and actions. We don't need you to write dialogue for your character and then have the next character's thoughts written out on the page telling us exactly what character flaw/pro that dialogue was supposed to be telling us. Frequently, the dialogue was enough to do that for us. Also, the book is riddled with cliches. I understand that it's a book about sailing, that doesn't mean eyes need to be as blue as the sea (especially not the Mediterranean). Also, about the eyes - I have never encountered so many people who could read so deeply into what other people's eyes were saying. But every character here could always see a whole spectrum of emotion just from someone else's eyes.I think if the book goes down to 99 cents again, it would be worth buying. It's a quick read and the plot is entertaining enough (though I almost stopped at the beginning, Ms. Freethy finds her groove towards the middle). Even at $3 it's worth it if you're a fan of the author, but for those who have never read the author and are considering it, I would say pass."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Good story. Will keep you guessing on the outcome. The sisters protect each other no matter what. What family is all about."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I just started reading Barbara Freethy books a couple of months ago and I really enjoy her as a author. \\"Summer Secrets\\" was a hard book to put down once you started reading it. You just wanted to know more and more of what the McKenna family was made of and all the twists and turns that were ahead once Tyler arrives in Castleton. You think you have everything figured out and in the end you don't. I really enjoyed this book a lot...:)"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Once I started reading this book I didn't want to put it down! I, too, grew up on an island in Puget Sound. The story brought back some great memories of island summers and the excitement of sailboat races. This is a wonderful book about family secrets and loyalties. It kept me guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It made me both smile and cry and kept my attention. I am looking forward to reading more of her books!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"It was a little slow starting but ended being a good book. I enjoyed the characters and the setting."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I loved Kate, Carolyn, and Ashley and their wonderful but flawed relationship with each other and their father. The dual secret plot was a plus. It made for a very enjoyable read.I would reccomend Summer Secrets to anyone who likes a simply good story about people, what makes them do the things they do and how they relate to each other after they've done them. I felt good when I finished."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This is the 2nd Barbara Freethy book I read. I completely enjoyed it. I will say the 1st book I read by her was a book I bought by mistake. I was looking to buy a Barbara Delinsky book. I didn't pay attention to the last name I just picked it up. I'm so glad I did because now I have a new author to read. I've made a list of all her books to put on my knidle. My Spring Break will be spent reading them."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I loved the McKenna family. The sisters are wonderful characters. Add to these great story people is a strong plot (secrets!) that kept me turning the pages (or clicking the forward button, as it were). The atmosphere of summer and sailing made the read like taking a vacation...a fun and romantic story!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Rarely have I looked forward to finishing a book. I should have stopped reading it in the first 50 pages. I thought maybe there would be an intelligent plot twist somewhere along the way, but this book reads like a Harlequin romance without the sex scenes. My apologies to the author and to the fan base, but if you are not a reader of sugar-sweet romance novels, do not buy this book.I would have given the book two stars were it not for the horrific editing. These were not small typos that the experienced reader stumbles over and then keeps reading. These were jarring errors that forced the reader to go back and re-read the last few sentences before the error, in order to decode the meaning. The author should ask for money back from the editor, if there was one."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This was a very good story and kept your interest until the very end. Will be reading more ofBarbara Freethy."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Barbara Freethy, This was my first book by you, but I assure you it will not be my last!I did lose a bit of sleep because of it, but it was worth it.

Lots of twists and turns!Thank you and blessingsFran Combs"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Then you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free....John 8:32.

Looking forward to more books fromher"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I, for once, never disappointed with Barbara Freethy, ever since I purchased my first book of her (One True Love) few years ago. She is my favorite author when it comes to family stories. She always manages to write such beautiful, heartwarming, and also real family stories. The joy, the tears, the fears, the loyalty ... they are always there, knotted into one amazing story. She did it again with SUMMER SECRETS. Each character stands out with their own self. The sisters are uniquely different with one another but nevertheless, united with a strong bond called &quot;family. The romance of course, is also beautiful. I love the chemistry between Tyler and Kate, also Ashley and Sean. I just wish Caroline will get her own man. This book is wonderful read ... if you don't know Barbara Freethy, you're missing such a talented author!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This book has got everything - romance, suspense and excitement.
