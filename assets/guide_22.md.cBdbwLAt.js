It is the best book to come out on the market to date. I can see why it is a hot item just in the amounts you get in return for what you put in. If it wasn't for this book we would still be experimenting with long branches, overcrowding and airy buds that are not potent. OVER 300 PAGES OF TEXT with illustrations COLOR SECTION and charts. The troubleshooting plant solver is one of the most important pieces of information to appear for the first time in any publication. It is a primary piece of work and an essential base.Because of his breeding knowledge Greg Green went on to write the leading book on Cannabis Science today called The Cannabis Breeder's Bible. The contents of that book are absolutely unique to Greg Green. It is the source of what people are doing today. Experts in the field have used Greg Green to update and completely revise everything.The index and table of contents make this book easy to use. The quality of writing is great and reads like a scientific text on the subject. You can understand what you are reading for a change. This was the first time high success rate cloning and bubble hash making was revealed.It is not just a matter of researching, this book has the experience and the practice of getting it ALL right. After two years the success stories are rock solid enough to warrant that this book should be recommended absolutely across the board as what you need. At least start here first even if you think you know it all. Experts did this and got a surprise with what they learned through it. It completely transformed the whole scene. Any advice on the internet or printed elsewhere that has some quality came from this book.

It is far better than the High Times back-page hype guides. If you want to have a collection of those question and answer type books then do not get this one. If you want a book that covers everything from the ground up like any botany book about roses, shrubs or growing your own veg then this is book you should really be after. Besides it is the only book out there written by a grower and not a journalist."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This book blows the myth that marijuana is seedy, not potent and hard to grow without a huge basement and lots of time. It is full of valuable information on how to grow your own very highly potent bud. You can produce ten times better bud than what you get on the street in your own home with limited amounts of space without making a mess of it or creating big smells. Three months is all it takes for new growers. It is easy to keep it small and have thirty grams a week in your stash. By small we are talking less than six plants that will not grow any taller than your waist. This is super easy year round productivity. You just got to know how to do it right and this book rocks for teaching that."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This book is why cannabis cultivation was revolutionized in the space of a year. It challanged every other cultivation concept in print and won. You will see this information incorporated in pot magazines and in other books. Yes, all the big names use it. The 'new' information I have seen in some other marijuana guides comes directly from this book. Just compare the 'Table of Contents'. This book is the beef on the bud. If you want to see how well this book has been adopted by growers just get his second book on advanced cultivation called 'The Cannabis Breeder's Bible'. There is nothing out there at this time that can compare to both these books. They are used by all major publications (including 'guru' staff writers). They are literally copying it. Word has it that all the other pot writers are going to have to completely reverse (not just revise, but reverse) their old ideas for the new ones here.

I would have failed in my first attempt at indoor growing if not for expert advice. With the book I knew what I needed to buy and how to set it up, before then I'd only read three other guides. All over 5 years old and full of tons of useless information i had to pore over to find what I was looking for. Even then I'd only get part of the answer to my questions and would have to check another book to get the next piece.

The author thinks he knows everything and that his book is the definitive work on the subject. That is a bad combo. When you have that attitude, then you are no longer open to new methods or opinions. Any book, in this day and age, that has 4 chapters on soil and only one on hydro is better used as kindling.

It was pretty much the first brand new Marijuana book to come out in a decade, maybe even more. What made it so inviting was its full table of contents that was all inclusive indoor, outdoor, soil, hydroponics and breeding in one single volume instead of needing four or five books about each area.In the pages are a well kept promise of new material and has very good word of mouth within the Internet community who recommend this Bible on all the web sites I have seen. The medical user community who went largely ignored get a full chapter about vaporizing and the medicinal quality of different high types. Props for that.This book references those web sites and I have seen many newbie growers come to those web sites because they found it covered in this book.I have also found this book and the other book referenced on Wikipedia and other sources. It is used as source material. I think it has very good word of mouth in the community and is very easy to recommend it to people because they get a very broad coverage of all the major Marijuana questions and topics.

However I have bought this book because its methods are legend. It's easy, clean, it's extremely---and I mean very---easy to run. It may be comprehensive but is by far, the most unified way of getting things done. It is complete with charts, pictures of each step by step process-and whatever else you need. And as for myself, I feel better about the costs of doing this now and that worry is far behind me. LOTS of money-saving advise!!! I mean it is clearly thoughtful with the right plan and accessibility for anyone. The only way you can make a mess of anything is by doing it another way. I have tried other methods (but why do you want too? My goodness---never again!). The fact that it covers substrates like vermiculite is a pro recommendations for cleaner production. You could read this book, get it right first, go into a co-op and come out with everything you need but seeds... and that is where you get ripped off. This book however covers seeds in a chapter called seeds. I see that is probably one of the reasons why this book worked so well for me and others. It just gets you thinking about the right type of genetics and tells you where to get those genetics. I have seen some people pull forty lbs out of a tiny hidden shed at the back of a garden no problem and instead of breaking your bank getting there you will easily add to it. Hell this book is a credit.I have never come across anything like this that avoids the costly routes proposed elsewhere. You can tell that Greg is doing this because he loves it and wants others to do it too. It makes you want to learn gardening and the advantages are obvious even before you have finished your first crop. This book has been going with me for three years now and it is all progress.

It was Roland Barthes' final book, the last of his great and highly idiosyncratic trilogy of autobiographical works (the earlier two being &quot;A Lover's Discourse&quot; and &quot;Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes&quot;).Although the book is ostensibly about Barthes' attempt to work out why he is moved by some photographs and not by others, it soon reveals itself to be a meditation on the absence inherent in photography. Barthes wrote before radical manipulation of the image had become a standard practice in photography, but even if he hadn't it would make no difference, as he is only interested in photographs insofar as they depict something that was there at that particular time, and is now (presumably) gone. He is particularly eloquent on a photograph - deliberately unreproduced here - of his beloved mother, who'd died shortly before he began to write the book. He doesn't even try to elaborate a grand theory of photography; this is unashamedly a book about himself and the loss he has suffered, which he finds echoed and prefigured in the photographs that he holds dear. This being the case, he is able to write as movingly and beautifully about a 19th century photograph of a condemned man (&quot;I observe with horror an anterior future of which death is the stake&quot;) as he can about the cherished Winter Garden photograph of his mother (which he doesn't reproduce in the book because, he says with heartbreaking discreetness, &quot;it exists only for me&quot;).Barthes wouldn't feel much at home in the digital age. For all his academic reputation as a whip-cracking avant-gardist, his most powerful and convincing writing is always yearning back to the past. He almost manages to make nostalgia seem not merely respectable but essential. But his generosity prevents him from imposing this point of view on the rest of us. That's what made him a great writer."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"Roland Barthes - Camera LucidaFrequently as I read through the brief, but provocative, Camera Lucida I would turn to the author photograph of Barthes on the back of the book. The further I got into Barthes' book the more I wondered just what he would have thought of the photo of himself. You see, in the pages of Camera Lucida Barthes explains how he sees most portraits as mere images that are far separated from the true identity, much less the soul, of the subject. And so I wondered, did Barthes ever see this portrait of himself? Was he the one who chose it for the back cover? Are the subtleties of this photograph effects Barthes consciously created as he posed for the camera?These questions that arouse in my mind went to the heart of, indeed were a product of my reading of, Camera Lucida. In this book Barthes explores the nature of photography, what sets it apart from other arts, what are its benefits, its liabilities. He also wonders what exactly a photograph is, what that cold image on paper truly captures.The book opens with Barthes wondering what is that one thing that a photograph, out of all other forms of art, possesses. While contemplating this he also muses that a photograph is forever linked to the object of which it is taken. That is to say that a photograph of a girl is always linked to that girl whereas a painting of a girl might very well be the construction of the author's mind and have no real world analog. Barthes does well to open with these two thoughts because they become the central insights on which he hangs the rest of his theories.Barthes is also concerned with how a photograph can exist, that is to say how it can become more than simply a sign pointing as a real world object, how it can come to embody that object on its own, how it can achieve, in a word, transparency. He sees photographs as dead objects, indeed at times is obsessed with this Death that he claims photographs confer on their subjects. It seems that somewhere inside Barthes is a desire to discover photographs that are not shadowed by Death; this is the transparent photograph he seeks.As Barthes investigates these theoretical propositions he beautifully blends blend cold theory and personal reflection. For instance, when Barthes recounts his experiences as the camera's subject, and we discover a shy, even vulnerable personality. Similarly Barthes evokes tender feelings when he recounts the touching effects of discovering what he believes to be the one true photograph of his mother. In Camera Lucida we see that the author is a man for whom ideas are not theoretical abstractions, but deeply felt concerns whose resolution is central to his well being. This organic blend of personal and professional reflection makes Camera Lucida a work of much intellect and much beauty.Camera Lucida is a slim book that carries a great deal of weight. It is a book that is highly recommended to anyone who is concerned with what separates a good photograph from a great one, as Barthes points a way past the proliferation of mediocre photographs to the truly great ones."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"One of my favorite books. Its discussion on thesubject of &quot;photography&quot; is incidental; instead, individual photos dominate. Camera Lucida is abook about loss &amp; grief, mortality, and love. Itis highly elliptical and idiosyncratic (&quot;rambling&quot;to some), beautiful and deeply moving. It's the one great thing I got out of English grad school."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"Barthes takes us on a somewhat rambling journey as heattempts to understand the essential meaning of photographs andto uncover what it is that aphotograph captures. Barthes cites a number of examples and hemakes his search for meaning very personal when hediscusses in detail his search for, and hisunderstanding of, the photograph whichcaptures the essential spirit of &quot;his mother&quot; for him. The bookhas tedious passages, but does capture some of what transpireswhen one finds a photograph which appeals. CameraLucida will be of interest to photographers who care about theircraft. For them, the book speaks in words about somethingthey probably already have an implicit understanding of.People who take only casualnotice of photographs will likely be bored in reading Camera Lucida, and may neverfinish the book.

Thus, a bit of the content isdated by the manipulation of images which thatrevolution has enabled.)"},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"I am somewhat stunned and dismayed by the negative reviews of this book. In fact, it has seem to elicit a sense of vitriol in some.It is a brilliant book. How does one state simply such a complicated phenomenon. One doesn't. Those who rated this book so poorly biggest gripe was the complexity of the writing. Well - it is a complex topic. But, I think Barthes beautifully and deftly counters this complexity with his personal reflections. The book is both a critical assessment of photography and an emotional one as well, and this is what makes it so wonderful.It is not wholly unexpected that most all the negative reviews of this book come late in the day - in the ever increasing time of sound-bites, instant pleasures and generally non-reflective immersion."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"After reading these last few negative reviews i had to write in about this, one of the most amazing books i have ever read. It is true that this book could be thought of as for the well read and serious academics only, but really, it is a book for anyone wishing to challenge the true nature of photography and its effect on the individual and society as a whole. No, it is not for those who simply wish to sit and idly consume 'pictures;' if this is you then do not bother even picking up this book.This book attempts to help us navigate the way we consume images, to make it easier to understand just what it is that draws us to them so much, and which for me it did beautifully. Barthes doesn't try to give all the answers, but rather approaches his explanation in a very poetic (not long winded as another reviewer said!)and personal language which gives an intimacy that is very rare in academic texts.If you truly want to open your eyes to the wider implications of photography then this book is a must (along with Susan Sontag's On Photography)"},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"The only disparaging thing I can say about this book is that it caused me to purchase a better dictionary."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"This is a great book!

While the ending lacks any sort of innovative conclusion, the journey to that point mankes you reconsider photography in a new and interesting way. A solid read!"},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"Enclosed among these \\"Reflections on Photography\\" is a provocative theory of art in general, of what gives art the power to keep us looking. Barthes speaks of what he calls the 'punctum,' that aspect of a photograph (or, by implication, of any image, visual or textual) that pierces the viewer's consciousness, that wounds us like a dart of desire and leads to a blurring of the line between the aesthetic and the erotic. Here is an answer to Sontag's call for an 'erotics of art.' (Barthes and Sontag were friends, and it's quite possible that they influenced each other.) A great image, great art, has the power to wound us and fascinate us like a lover. And we as viewers must open ourselves to this power, like people in love. Indeed, one of the things Barthes is doing in this book is 'cruising' photography in the same way that he, a gay man, might have 'cruised' attractive men in the beaches, bars and baths of the 1970's. A wonderful book that deserves to be more widely read."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"A tried and true essay of many years.

It is no longer necessary to remove one's subjective, deeply personal response/s to a photograph/s. Within pages, Barthes deconstructs the objective/subjective binary, which opens the way one can write and talk about a photograph/s in a personal and/or academic setting.In the section, I believe called *The Winter Garden,* which is at the end of his book, Barthes discusses his (recently passed) mother and her photograph, which he adores and yet does not re-produce in the book: be does not present her and re-member her, but rather rememories her (Morrison). What he writes about the photgraph and his mother (the-photograph-and/as-his-mother?) is absolutely moving and touching (I cried, and i still do ... no matter how many times I read this section of _Camera Lucida_).Through all of this, the twists and turns in the book, you beging to realize, or at least I did, that the photograph is about touching (and I dont only mean his idea of the *punctum*)--but not in a unilinear fashion: the photo touches me as I touch it; there is a chiasmus. Indeed, this section--the entire book, actualy--is also a brilliant discussion, without overtly discussing it, on the phenomenological experience with the/a photograph.Barthes' book has left an imprint on me--I guess it, the book, touched me too, which will not soon go away. It has helped me look at photographs (of all kinds) in a different way, through different lenses.I would suggest that you read this book more than once (!), and you may want to read it in relation to one of his other books, which was roughly written at the same time, _The Lover's Discourse_. Indeed, Barthes is deeply moving and philosophical without any type of tedium or over-kill. Hmm, I would argue that Barthes has set the stage for more writing and meditating on love and the image, love and the other.x-robt"},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"Written shortly after his mother's death there is a very dark and mortal tone in this reading. Roland Barthes refers to life and death heavily throughout the book and the ongoing intermingling of those themes comes to a climax towards the end. This particular aspect of the book really grabs the reader in many ways. I found myself torn, often times within minutes, between feeling able to be one with the author then finding him alien. The roller coaster of emotions that are portrayed are symbolic of life itself as we grow, learn, reach, and find disappointment because of limitations caused by time and death. Does the photograph capture life, or does it capture death?Barthes reaches controversy in Camera Lucida when he eludes to amateur photographers' mastery of photography over the professional photographers. No doubt there were many professional photographers enraged by this conclusion therefore finding the book to be no more than the ramblings of a broken man. Admittedly I was taken aback, but held my emotions in check (as much as I could) as I continued on with the book.I think Barthes got it wrong then, but does he get it wrong now? I think one could argue that with the price of quality photographic equipment in the price range of the average consumer we stumble upon much more than the ordinary when perusing through images online. Does more photographers (and easier sharing methods) mean we, as a community, are getting better? And if so, does that mean that the gap between quality from the \\"professional photographers\\" and the \\"hobbyists\\" is closing? Maybe he never had it wrong all along.One of the best aspects of a book like Camera Lucida is that it raises more questions than offers answers."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"Great book for ALL photographers.

Lyrical and brilliant, it is equal parts philosophy, prose poem and history. A veritable MUST."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"If you're thinking of reading this hoping for some insight on the creative process of the photographer, don't look to this ponderous, jargon-laden critique of \\"The Photograph\\". Barthes readily admits he's not a photographer and his viewpoint is only from side of the observer and the object. Barthes does offer a couple of intriguing ideas: the concepts of \\"studium\\" and \\"punctum,\\" but since he seems to concentrate almost exclusively on photographs of human subjects (portraits and photojournalism), much of those ideas aren't as developed as they should be. Instead, he tries to explain why certain photographs evoke an emotional response (the punctum) in him. Of course, I may have misunderstood his point completely but not for want of trying. His esoteric use of existentialist terms makes it a tough read for those without a substantial education in philosophy. In any case, much of his critique has been overturned and made obsolete by the advent of digital photography (he explains early on that he doesn't have the patience to be a photography because he wants an instant result; there's nothing more instant than a digital photo) and digital photo manipulation (e.g. Photoshop)."},{"Title":"Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography","review":"Barthes breathes a refreshing subjectivity into the debate around photography's objective/subjective nature.

(Makes for a great keepsake.) I often use baby name books in my line of work and have at least five, but this one is by far the best: great definitions and &quot;foreign&quot; variations of common names put it above the rest, plus a surprisingly informative astrology section. I had to deduct a star, though, because even the latest addition neglects proper pronunciations, which is disappointing.Another good one: try The New Age Baby Name Book by Sue Browder if still in print; over 3000 African, Hindu, Arabic, Native American and Occult/mythological names.

Honestly, my main motivation in buying was the fact that root words for the names are included, and this is extremely rare in baby name books. It's also fairly diverse compared to the Brittany and Cody 20-name-book mainstream garbage available in most stores. It also gives you foreign versions of a name. For example, Elizabeth in Irish is Eilis (EYE lish) [unfortunately, pronunciations are not included in the book-- something I find VERY important, especially if the parent is choosing an exotic name they've never even heard or spoken before! All name books should contain pronunciations.]."},{"Title":"Name Your Baby","review":"\\"Name Your Baby\\" is a guide designed to help new parents select a name for the new addition to the family. It includes hundreds of different name options for boys and girls, along with the national origins for each name and the meaning behind the name. With some names, the guide also includes famous people who share the name (if it's a lesser- known name) and trivial facts.This guide can be useful when one is in need of some brainstorming suggestions for baby names. It is also fun to use for finding out information on the various names- where they originated and what they mean. But it isn't the perfect guide for several reasons, most notably the fact that it hasn't been revised for nearly twenty years. This guide was first released back in the early 1960's and it was updated a few times since then. But it hasn't been updated since the last publication date in 1986 and because of this, there are many modern names that will not be found in this guide.One other problem I had with this book is the section on astrology. This part of the guide is found near the front and it attempts to explain to you, the parent to be, what personality traits you can expect your new baby to have based on his/her Zodiac sign. This seems out of place in a book like this one since we have little control over out baby's astrological sign. It would have been better if the guide eliminated this section and replaced it with something similar- a section that deals with something relating more directly to a baby.Overall, this guide is ok as a name resource because it can help you brainstorm when you have no idea what name to choose. It has a few flaws and is in desperate need of a revision, but it can help new parents in making this important decision. Well- known names and rare and unusual names are spelled out in this book, providing both traditionalists and new age parents a place to start when the time comes to search for the right name for their new baby."},{"Title":"Name Your Baby","review":"This book is at once appealing and helpful.

It is rewarding to read such a fine extended novel from a writer who has specialized in the terse, concise, brief span of the short story mode: many who excel in that arena find the challenge of a long novel daunting. Not Karen Heuler. From the original concept of a novel about identical twin girls whose only apparent disparity is the analgia (inability to feel pain) of Meg, a 'defect?' which twin Abby does not share, Heuler has opened the bestiary of life at large and introduces fascinating character after character, each of whom comes to figure in the endlessly creative drama that unfolds. The twins' parents devote their lives to protecting Meg from harm, creating a 'safe' environment that Meg brazenly ignores only to be victim to falls, cuts, bruises, fractures, and deformed limbs despite the omnipresent guardianship of her identical other, Abby. The family's ability to survive this bizarre scientific variant is further complicated by the mother falling victim to a virulent cancer, a twist of fate that further burdens the finances of the family, ultimately forcing the father to move his family to the Institute where researchers welcome the ability to study Meg as a guinea pig while providing the mother with medical care. Life at the Institute includes at least one new friend, Greif, a girl whose mother has a genetic propensity to madness, a gene Greif assures the twins she will inherit. That friendship provides ventures into the dark interstices of the research facilities of the Institute where the girls are made aware of animal experiments on human disease states. Of note, the agonizing pain the twins' mother feels in response to her disease state and chemotherapy serve only as a trigger to make Meg flee the 'un-understood' pain of her mother. After the mother's eventual death and the re-marriage of the father, Abby and Meg drift apart: being unable to live without each identical other ultimately results in strains neither can endure. Abby marries and leads a normal home life , collecting cats and dogs, and aberrant needy homeless children in her workplace while Meg returns to the Institute to serve as a research assistant. Meg herself begins occult-type treatments for her analgia in the form of injections and medications by one of the staff researchers. By other twists of coincidence Meg, Greif and Abby reunite and discover their true individualities in a most absorbing and mysterious ending.If this all sounds rather odd - well, it is, and therein lies the magic of Karen Heuler. Not only does she paint her characters with such realism that we can see them on the page and in the room around us, she also surveys psychological, medical, genetic, and scientific issues with such clarity that reading her book informs as well as entertains. \\"Science is a great adventure; so much is still undiscovered. Every autopsy, every microscope slide - there could be anything there. Doors. They are all little doors. Some of the doors go nowhere, some lead back to the start. But there's always a door somewhere that takes you someplace totally new.\\" \\"I want the exact moment when death occurs...The clinical picture. I believe there's part of the brain that signals death; that death itself is an organic response, not just a sort of loss of power. I believe there's a point at which the brain - or the mind - refuses to live any longer because it recognizes that the destruction is overwhelming.\\" \\"Thoughts are chemical - or at least thoughts tied to a physical impulse are. Maybe it's true for all thoughts, even the thought for a play, a poem, a painting, a song. All of it is capable of being induced. I really think everything is, even scientific breakthroughs, energy solutions, cures for cancer. The idea is enormous!\\" And suggesting the novel's conclusion (without giving it away!), \\"The mind is at its best when distracted from itself. Such a tragedy, although I see in it a parable of sorts. It is interesting, isn't it, that when [Meg] was immune to pain she had no purpose; it is only now, when she must lock herself up in a soft room, that she can focus.\\"And though I find myself quoting the more scientific aspects of Hueler's novel, it is her beautiful prose and vivid characterization that make this alluring novel a page turner. This is a writer of exceptional talent, a writer who is a joy to read. It is also important to comment that the care in choosing the cover of this book seduces you into the mysteries and joys between the covers. On the book's cover is a superb design by Helosia Zero which focuses on the very beautiful painting of twins by the artist David Fratkin. Boy, as a curator and art writer I would certainly like to see more of his work! Highly recommended reading and an especially fine choice for book clubs and other intellectual pursuits!"},{"Title":"The Soft Room","review":"The Soft Room is based on a clever plot involving twin sisters Abigail and Megan. Though they are identical, there is one big difference. Megan is born with a rare disease that causes her to feel no pain. In the hands of a lesser writer, this plot could easily have turned predictable, but Heuler's writing is anything but predictable. This is a story about how something that everyone takes for granted--that is, the ability to feel physical pain--can, by its absence also cause a person to feel such disattachment to the human condition that they also suffer the grief of being unable to experience emotional pain. I found this novel dark and disturbing. At times it had the feel of something Stephen King might have come up with, and that is certainly a compliment in this reader's opinion. If you enjoy exploring the darker sides of the human condition, then you will find this book to your liking. A fine novel, and worth the time and money invested.

His love of working cowboys, his respect for horses, and his devotion to the fraternity of men who worked cattle and horses on the open range give his stories an easy warmth - like a comfortable old boot. This book is a collection of his early stories first published in national magazines as his writing career suddenly took off in the 1920s. They are fictionalized autobiography, told in the first person by the drifting cowboy of the title, a young man named Bill, who is an accomplished bronc rider.The stories are told in a leisurely fashion, in the unpolished, ungrammatical jargon of someone sitting around a cow camp swapping yarns with the other boys. The pace seems very slow until you realize that James is trying to capture not the drama but the everydayness of cowboy life. Even while he idealizes his subject, he wants us to feel what it is really like - the grueling, dangerous work of herding cattle that are likely to stampede without warning; the fruitless search for work in lean times; the struggle to keep cattle fed and watered in the desert.Competing in a local rodeo, Bill and his friend Tommy have to outwit the promoters, who rig the results with unfair judges and by manipulating the draw, but what is interesting about this story is the actual experience of being a rodeo cowboy. Our heroes participate in several events (unlike today), and James conveys the mixture of excitement, nerves, disappointment, and triumph that his heroes feel.Most striking about the stories is James' capturing of the spirit of fraternity among cowboys, their generosity, and their gallantry. For all their toughness and fierce disregard for personal injury, there is a gentleness in them that makes these stories almost endearing. And in their tendency to \\"drift,\\" there's a dedicated individualism that is tempered by loneliness and melancholy. Reading James, it's easy to see how he helped to create the myth of the cowboy in the American imagination.I'm happy to recommend this book. There are seven wonderful stories and 44 of his carefully detailed illustrations, most of them featuring horses with hooves flying and lean cowboys with big hats, who look a lot like James himself in his photographs."},{"Title":"The Drifting Cowboy","review":"I ordered this book for a friend who loves cowboys. He said it was fabulous plus Will James (the author) illustrates all of his books."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"This is quite an interesting book. I adore Mr. Copan's ability to not merely &quot;chop logic,&quot; but to hold up the torch of intelligence. This book, and his previous book, &quot;True For You, But Not For Me,&quot; are geared toward defeating the pseudo-converational sloganeering that passes off for discussion and thought that will be the undoing of Generation-X.Copan tackels these &quot;bumper-sticker&quot; thought-bites head on. Try these out on someone who is a walking platitude, and you see what I mean.The most objectiobns will be with the Trinity, the Incarnation, and Evolution. He takes a more Trinitarian approach to the Trinity, which some would interperit as polytheism but as the Good Book says, &quot;There be gods many, and lords many . . .&quot; (1 Cor. 8:5). This is really a mystery that even Aquinas couldn't logically prove. Wasn't it C. S. Lewis who siad that the Trinity of the Creeds was either the greatest truth or the greatest lie?In regards to the incarnation, he wrestles with the tempations of Christ and His divinity, and asserts that Chriat had laid his divinity aside, as per Phillipians 2. He runs betweeen making a monkey out of the Bible, or making a monkey out of the Savior, andf I think he steers a steady course between the two.He advocates a hybrid theiostic evolution, with the days being of indeterminant length. See the usage of &quot;day&quot; in Genesis 2:4 versus Genesis 1:5.The trick is to defend you faith, and affirm the strengths of your opponents position, without selling our your own theology in the name of reason, or some theoretical elegance."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"The title of this book could not be more fitting, as it Copan's flawed and ridiculous INTERPRETATION of Scripture and the nature of God.Copan needs to read up on some verses, namely, Jeremiah 10:23, John 5:19 and 15:5, and Philippians 2:13, not to mention Proverbs 16:9 and 19:21, all of which shoot down the notion of man's supposed sovereign \\"free will\\", which legalists like to think will somehow override the actual sovereign will of God. L. Ray Smith's website, Bible-Truths.com, has some excellent refutations of the \\"free will\\" notion.He also needs to study the Greek terms, \\"aion\\" and \\"aionion\\", which do not denote \\"eternity\\" or \\"eternal\\" as is often thought when it comes to verses like Matthew 25:46. His INTERPRETATION of \\"Hell\\", while 10,000 times more merciful than the \\"Hellfire and Damnation\\" notion, is still unscriptural and a misinterpretation. \\"Hell\\" is actually derived from the Anglo-Saxon \\"Hel\\", meaning \\"hole\\" or \\"hidden place\\", hardly the kind of words that would bring up visualizations of \\"torment\\".Copan proves that when you are possessed by the obsession to \\"win, win, win arguments against those good-for-nothing non-Christians\\", you start to pour out nonsense like this. \\"Apologetics\\" seems to take on the characteristics of a fistfight rather than a search for the deeper and abiding knowledge and wisdom of God. Copan simply joins the ever-growing list of legalistic apologists who seem, if you'll excuse the expression, \\"Hell\\"-bent on BEING RIGHT AT ALL COSTS."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"I hate to say this about a Christian apologist like Paul Copan, who has put out some very good apologetic material, but this book was horrendous. I mean it was absolutely terrible. I can't even begin to describe how many poor conclusions were reached and how many poor answers were given to problems raised with Christianity. He had EXTREMELY simplistic and EXAGGERATED explanations of what other faiths held (especially Eastern Pantheism, which he completely misrepresented).On pages 98-99 Copan discusses the problem of natural disasters. Copan&#8217;s explanations in the previous parts of this chapter seem to deal only with moral evils which result from human choices, so here he attempts to address the issue of evil which seems not to stem from human choices. He argues that natural disasters are actually necessary to keep life on this planet alive (98). For example, earthquakes are needed to recycle essential nutrients back into the continents (98). I personally do not find his argument very convincing. I think that any Christian would need to tie natural evils into the Fall as Schaffer does in Genesis in Space and Time, where he presents natural evils as stemming from a rift which developed between man and nature as a result of sin. If we do not do this, it does not make much sense for God to curse the ground as a result of Adam&#8217;s sin, for it would already have been cursed if nothing in nature changed as a result of the Fall. Further, as a philosophical objection, surely God could have created a world where natural disasters were not necessary to sustain the earth. Copan responds to this by saying that we cannot know that a world with this condition is possible (98-99), but does he really believe that there will be natural disasters on the new earth? I sincerely hope that he has better expectations than that.Copan also claims that all three members of the Trinity got together before Jesus became incarnate and decided what Jesus self-limitations should be (135). He makes it sound like God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit had this little business meeting and voted on what Jesus should have to give up in becoming human. I cannot imagine what Copan could possibly use to support this view, as we hardly have access to the logs from the Trinity&#8217;s meetings, nor do I see why this was a necessary point to be thrown in with the rest.Copan had some absolutely horrible theological implications spread all over the book. For example, he had a chapter discussing how it could be that Jesus was tempted, since the Bible says that God cannot be tempted. Copan&#8217;s idea that Jesus mistakenly thought that he could sin when he in reality could not is not a view that seems particularly attractive to me. Copan seems to be stretching things a bit too far when he claims that Jesus simply thought that he could sin, therefore the temptation was real to him (141). Copan decided beforehand that Jesus could not sin because God cannot sin (though he fails to address the problem which he opens the chapter with in saying &#8220;if God cannot sin, then it seems he is not really free or all-powerful&#8221; [138]), and is forced to reduce himself to pulling some strange stunts to make his ends meet. Unfortunately for Copan, I do not think that concluding that Jesus must have been mistaken in his beliefs is an adequate way of making his ends meet. If Jesus was mistaken about his ability to sin, why should he not be mistaken about other things as well? Copan&#8217;s solution seems to simply open up an even larger can of worms than the one he is attempting to close with his answer.Some of his answers to problems raised with Christianity are simply rediculous. For example, in the chapter discussing the Cananite genoicide, Copan says that the Israelite soldiers did not go around raping and brutalizing the Canaanites, as the Crusaders did to the Muslims (165-166). They were not fighting (in theory) out of love for bloodshed, but in obedience to God, and they fought under God&#8217;s morality even in battle (165-166). While this is helpful information, I am not sure that it really alleviates the problem addressed in this chapter: &#8220;how could a loving God command genocide?&#8221; I am not sure that a skeptic interested in the Christian faith would be comforted if we told him &#8220;well, God may have commanded genocide and killed every man, woman, and child of Canaanite blood, but He had the Israelites do it kindly and they weren&#8217;t even cruel to the Canaanites when they killed them.&#8221; It just seems to me the objection raised is that God commanded genocide, not that God had them killed cruelly. The killing of the Canaanites is the main issue, not how they died.I could go on and on. It was simply a poor book, and if one accepted all the answers and explanations that he gave, one would end up as a open theist who believes in contradictory ideas and is ill prepared to actually give an answer for his faith when challenged by a skeptic. I cannot imagine many skeptics stupid enough to accept most of the answers that Copan gives in this book. There are good answers to the questions he addresses, he just does not give them.Overall grade: D-"},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"Paul Copan does an admirable job of presenting arguments that will prove useful especially to the general reader. He strikes a nice balance between real substance and accessibility. It's true that here and there the author might have strengthened his premises and thus his conclusions. However, by doing this he would also have moved the treatment of relativism beyond the grasp of some general readers--those who would profit most from the book. In response to the Mormon reviewer below, I have to respectfully disagree with his criticism of Copan's treatment of the Trinity. There is no possible way that Copan can be construed as veering into polytheism--or, a plurality of gods. In line with historical Christian orthodoxy, he understands that there is no contradiction in the classical doctrine of the Trinity. And, emphatically to the contrary, St. Thomas Aquinas presented one of the most lucid and logical expositions Trinitarian doctrine. To say that there are three persons in one divine substance is no contradiction. The categories of &quot;person&quot; and &quot;essence&quot; (or &quot;substance&quot;) are distinct. The doctrine of the Trinty does not say that there is one God who is three gods, nor that there are three persons who are one person. It accepts from biblical revelation that there is One God (one divine substance), and three persons or centers of consciousness. Logically, this is to say that there is one &quot;A&quot; and three &quot;B&quot;s--logically distinct, and thus coherent categories. What WOULD be irrational would be to claim that the &quot;godhead&quot; is comprised of three finite beings, with a mere unity of will but not of Being. Copan is not guilty of such a silly blunder, and it misrepresents his thought to suggest it. In short, the book will prove useful, because accessible, to a wide range of readers."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"Paul is a friend of mine. We both graduated from TEDS under William Lane Craig, and we both attended Marquette University, but we did so at different times. We didn't meet until this year. I am one of the skeptics he argues against.I have honestly learned a few things in this book, and yet, I am still unconvinced by his arguments. Nonetheless, I have to say that his book offers in a concise way the results of evangelical scholarship on the questions he addresses. When I am arguing with Christians about a topic he speaks of, I take another look at what he says to see what the best interpretation of that topic is from a evangelical Christian perspective, and that's saying a lot, coming from a skeptic like me.Paul's arguments that there was animal pain and death before the Fall and that God created human beings as meat-eaters (on pages 150-152), plays into my argument against the existence of God from the horrible suffering caused by the law of predation in our world, so I refer readers of my book to his on that point.In any case, even though I disagree with him, this is a great Christian apologetics book on the issues he speaks about. And as odd as this sounds, I want to read more of what he writes so I can see what is the best that can be said for evangelical Christianity, since he represents it so well.-----------I'm the author of \\"Why I Became an Atheist,\\" and the edited book, \\"The Christian Delusion.\\""},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"Having bought and/or read a number of books in this vein, Copan's work seems to be accessible and understandable by the lay person, yet at the same time offers enough depth for the person interested in deeper treatments of various subjects. The chapters are brief enough to keep the average person interested. I would recommend it as a primer for the non-academic who wants an introductory treatment of critical worldview issues.I do have an issue with \\"Ben J\\"'s review of the book and its mischaracterisation of Copan. After browsing his other reviews, it seems he doesn't like ANY of the Christian books he's reviewed and seems to include the same hyper-critical elements in most of his reviews - as if he's working from the same template for all of them (including the non-orthodox position that the Bible teaches that everyone, Christian and non-Christian, will be saved, which runs absolutely contrary to the orthodox Christian position that has been held for 2000 years. How Ben pulls that out of Scripture is beyond me. The fact that Copan disagrees with that view makes Ben attacks his work. But I digress.....). But specifically here, his accusation that Copan's attitude in this book is to preach some message of \\"win the argument over the 'poor pitiful non-Christians' at all costs\\" is so offbase that it seems to me he threw that in there to mischaracterise Copan and throw the on-the-fence person off from considering it as a reading possibility.On the contrary, Copan takes great pains, starting even in the first couple chapters and repeating it throughout the rest of the book, to talk about how Christians must conduct any discussions of critical issues in love and respect for other's viewpoint and always seek to build positive bridges between themselves and those they are trying to reach. \\"Ben J\\" read the book (at least I think he did), yet he can't see that. So it seems to me that Ben's problem is that he just doesn't want to see it at any cost, so he'll mischaracterise the book and the author with wild straw-man statements in the hopes that the unsuspecting reader will be convinced that Ben knows what he's talking about.Get a copy of the book for yourself and then draw your own conclusion as to whether I am right on this or Ben is right. I'm confident as to which conclusion you will reach."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"In this book Paul Copan offers apologetic responses to twenty-one different criticisms of Christianity. Written in a clear, informal style, each chapter includes a summary of its major points and a short list of further reading. Copan writes from an evangelical perspective but generally avoids taking a hard line on issues like inerrancy (he accepts Big Bang cosmology and doesn't believe in a literal six-day creation) and the theory of evolution (which isn't really discussed). He adopts the \\"worldview\\" perspective that's been popular in Christian apologetics in recent years, in which most people are seen as falling into a number of broad belief system frameworks. However, Copan is not as rigid in his portrayal of these worldviews as some other apologetics writers. For instance, many evangelical writers crate an elaborate portrayal of a \\"naturalistic\\" worldview, claiming that its proponents are essentially extreme nihilists, and making little more than a straw man argument with a limited connection to what anyone really believes. Copan, however, takes a softer approach, and although he criticizes \\"relativism,\\" he avoids creating rigid categories.The content and quality of Copan's arguments is something of a mixed bag. His treatment of the subject of hell once again shows his soft approach: he denies the existence of literal physical torture in hell, suggesting instead that the eternal torment will instead be merely some sort of emotional anguish over being cut off from the presence of God. Copan also avoids explicitly claiming that all non-Christians will go to hell, though it's unclear whether that's simply an omission or if he really allows for the possibility that the Christian God will show mercy on good people who choose the wrong deity to worship.The chapter of Biblical slavery is weakly researched; Copan essentially argues that the slavery allowed by the Bible wasn't all that harsh and had protections for the slaves that were lacking in, say, the American Old South. However, an inspection of Copan's footnotes reveals that he depended for his facts on a very small number of secondary sources, mostly from evangelical Christian publishers. No doubt there is primary source material and a considerable amount of original research about Biblical slavery, and any complete assessment of the issue would need to dig into that literature to produce a balanced portrait. But Copan doesn't seem to have done the level of research that's required, opting instead to depend on a few sources that give the most favorable support to his viewpoint.On the whole, Copan's book makes interesting and easy reading if one is interested in finding learning about a softer-hearted viewpoint in Christian apologetics (though even Copan feels compelled to defend the morality of the Old Testament slaughter of the Canaanites). He does not offer a whole lot that is new or original, though, and a committed skeptic is unlikely to find any hard challenges to his beliefs."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much even though I found some of the arguments a bit too simplistic to stand against a hostile opponent who has thought some of these issues through..The biggest weakness is the author's use of the Moral Argument without laying it out effectively. A few sentences destroying a straw man of relativism does not prove theistic absolutism nor does the existence of moral outrage prove that there are objective moral principles.The book does however demonstrate an approach for the thinking Christian but is far more effective in dealing with the lunatic fringe of Christianity who advocate \\"Creation Science\\", violence, racism etc. in the name of their God than it is with dealing with a determined critic of Christianity.The open minded skeptic will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"Paul Copan is a new author to by reading list, but after reading one of his books I purchased everything else that I could find by him."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"The only reason I gave this book one star is because zero stars isn't an option. This book is a waste of paper and ink.There are several things about this book that greatly disturbed me.First, this book is blantantly unbiblical. Most of the things in this book have no basis whatsoever in Scripture. This book is perfectly named. It contains nothing more than worldly wisdom and the author's often absurb interpretations of Scripture. It twists the teachings of Christ and Scripture to an almost unbelievable degree. Scriptures are often taken out of context and used to support man-made ideas.I had high hopes for this book. A non Christian friend has asked some questions that I don't know how to answer. So I hoped this book would help me find the answers. Suffice it to say, I was very wrong.It also concerns and grieves me that bible scholars such as Ravi Zacharias and JP Moreland have endorsed this book. Surely scholars of this caliber should be able to recognize the many unbiblical teachings in this book.Many Christians are so guillible today. Many seem to believe that just because a person claims to be a christian it means they are.This book is a perfect example of why discernment is so neccessary.Do yourself a favor. If you are looking for answers, look elseware. I would recommend anything by Norman Geisler. Skip this book."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"I read this book enjoying it at first, but after moving out of dealing with eastern religions/relativism, I found myself in constant disagreement with him. He seems to embraces the Arminian error, which leads him to suggest ideas that require the use of philosophy over scripture.I really only recommend the first few chapters of this book, but when he moves into Christian apologetics, do yourself a favor and return the book to the library.Edit: Looking over some of my past product reviews, I noticed I called Copan a heretic, rather than (rightly) saying that he's only in error. I changed the language to reflect my growth in Christ when it comes to embracing those who are not in the Reformed tradition."},{"Title":"That's Just Your Interpretation: Responding to Skeptics Who Challenge Your Faith","review":"One of Copans older books that Shows a clear presentation.

She has lots of chores, gardening, harvesting, canning, etc. and she is so busy that she only has time to read in the winter months. Sharing the house are farm animals and wild animals indigenous to Australia: koala, platypus, etc. We see the change of seasons from cold to blazing hot summer to the autumn rainy season and flooding. Happy tale of a busy woman. It is a bit strange that the wild animals are hanging around insider her house. If you are looking to expose your child to Australian animals this will be a fun read for you.This story does show that an elderly gray-haired woman can find happiness and lead a full life, being both mentally active and physically active, and can live what is sometimes a physically challenging life in the country. Portrays a self-sustaining woman in a positive light. There are not many images of elderly women leading such a life available in children's books--this is a rare subject."},{"Title":"The Old Woman Who Loved to Read","review":"Well, believe it or not..I ordered this one for myself!

Along the way you begin to piece the fractured bits together and find a stained-glass mural that shows the rich colors and attention to detail that form the rose-colored glasses she, so conspicuously, chooses to accesorize her view of life. The joy she finds from things that strike out at conventional tastes is almost evangelical..Before the third chapter you begin to wonder what ever happened to men who tipped their fedoras to a passing lady or the custom of DRESSING for dinner. You also discover that, beneath the veneer of a trend-hopping fashionista, you are discovering a woman who savors even the smallest details of life as if they were beluga roe or the breezes near the jasmine hedges on the clifftop gardens of the Mediterranean. You will laugh out loud and you'll catch yourself in a nostalgia for a more glamorous era when being on a &quot;best-dressed&quot; list meant you had more than just a lot of money to throw at the salespeople on Madison Avenue. She tells of fitting sessions ( FOR HER NIGHTGOWNS !) and the spring collections between her tangents that lament the demise of &quot;fringe&quot;. Some may call her shallow and ungrounded but I think she is &quot; a bit of 'all right' &quot;.I have a first edition hardback that I use to escape the modern world when I have seen too many baseball caps worn backwards that day. The book was the basis for the off-Broadway play &quot;Full Gallop&quot; and is essential for anyone who forgets that fashion, beauty, glamour, and enormous style are the four basic food groups of living &quot;out loud&quot;.

I could have read this for weeks, and I would have loved another couple thousand pages. There is a paucity of photos, which is a shame, because Vreeland loved the camera as much as it obviously loved her strong, aristocratic features. Some people might dismiss her as a featherweight, but I wouldn't. To do so, would be to fail to understand a singularly fascinating woman. During her time on earth she met most of the big and small names, and has something to say about most of them. I was so enamoured of this small book, that I am going to have to buy a biography. When you read this book, she tells you everything and nothing personal at the same time. A rare gift, to be sure, and not one that I appreciated! As someone else noted, it seems a great pity to only be able to give this delicious tour de force 5 stars, but there you are: life is seldom fair. I would love to have a best friend as fascinating and maddening as Vreeland, but I doubt I ever will. She is a product of another time and another generation.

Boy was I wrong! Instead I read the musings of a completely shallow, totally self-involved fashionista. I struggled to read each chapter, wondering when she would do anything of substance or meaning. I mean, the woman wouldn't even leave Paris during WWII until the last possible moment (her husband had already fled) because she couldn't bear to leave the couture houses! She even claimed that she was the person who is responsible for the creation of quickdry nail polish and Revlon - pretty far-fetched if you ask me. Every memory about important events in her life was associated not with the event itself but with what she was wearing.I realize that you have to appreciate the book for what it is - her own experience of the world in the times in which she lived.

Friend to all the rich and famous, she moved freely in high society, imprinting it with her personal style and never losing her earthiness. When she made her faux pas, they were so hilarious that nobody even thought of suing her. Owners of major European fashion houses gave her their clothes because they knew that they'd be seen by all the best (read \\"richest\\") people, who would no doubt pay the clothes more attention than they did dear Diana's plain face (she acknowledged it as so herself). If ever a person made the most of every card she was dealt, it was Diana Vreeland. And \\"DV\\" is a narrative of her very own world with details you never knew before. (I'll give you one tidbit as a hint: Edward VI made up his mind that he didn't want to be king LONG before he met Wally Simpson.) Buy this book and enter Vreeland's parlour for some revealing and often amusing gossip about nearly every high society character of her times--royalty, high profile politicians (including the Kennedys in their prime), artists, authors--everyone who made the news worth reading.

Well, whatever. In an age of fraud and being less than truthful to the public, it's permissible here because D.V. has such a good time, and really, we'll never know with someone who led a life that epitomized the meaning of glamor and style. D.V. is from the era just before tabloidery, going commando, and movie stars traveling with stylists, and her memoir is less about real events than how one person decided to do it all in grand style. While I usually balk at any personal histories that seem a bit too much on the \\"so privileged, la-di-dah\\" side, D.V.'s prose reveals only her elegance and her joy at being around style and trendsetting in all its forms - art, achievement, derring-do.Her madcap writing, asides, and tangents provide little snippets about how she felt people ought to comport themselves, and if you aren't terribly on the very serious side, you will enjoy it or at least enjoy getting to know Mrs. Vreeland.

Her evocation of the 1920's to 1960's is priceless and more valuable than any history book.

This is a bridge linking the two major classics from Locke, An Essay concerning Human Understanding and the Two Treatises of Government. In this volume, we see Locke's dependence on Stoic philosophy (especially that of Seneca) and the effect that Aristotelian philosophy had on him.&quot;As the Strength of the Body lies chiefly in being able to endure Hardships, so also does that of the Mind. And the great Principle and Foundation of all Vertue and Worth, is . . . That a Man is able to deny himself his own Desires, cross his own Inclinations, and purely follow what Reason directs as best, tho' that appetite lean the other way.&quot; And how does one do this? Locke's answer is through education (i.e., through habit).Anyone wishing to understand the thought and philosophy of Locke, can not afford to ignore this volume in the corpus of Lockean writings. This edition is a very scholarly edition, there is another modern edition available as well. To bad the editors of the Clarendon Edition of the Works of John Locke are not very organized, at the rate these volumes are being produced, the complete writings will not be available during my lifetime.The world needs a modern edition of the writings of Locke, he is too important a thinker not to have this - if nothing else, for us inspiring Lockean scholars. :o)"},{"Title":"Some thoughts concerning education","review":"This is amazingly accessible for a book written 320 years ago. A small bit of his vocabulary is archaic, and his delivery is more wordy than is common in modern prose. Still, today's reader will find interest in the ideas, not just the book's place in history.To place him in history, Locke's life spanned the last three quarters of the 17th century. He followed the scientific revolution initiated by Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton, whom he admired, and the philosopher Thomas Hobbes. An early philosophe, he predated Burke, Hume, Voltaire and Rousseau by about a century.While Locke was a doctor, certainly the worst advice in the book has to do with medicine. Although the scientific revolution had begun, it had not progressed to the point of evidence-based theories of disease. As one example, Locke proposes that his upper-class readers put their children in thin cloaks and shoes, so they will be toughened by exposure to cold. No thought of isolating them from bugs.Fully half of the book used dedicated to the moral and ethical formation of a child. He discourses at length on what to do about children who lie, daydream, are cruel to animals, are querulous (froward), inattentive, rude, bashful and otherwise imperfectly formed in character. He is very classic in his view that one must educate the whole child. In fact, he only gets around to talking about academic subjects in the last fifth of the book, opening with the quote \\" Learning. -- You will wonder, perhaps, that I put learning last, especially if I tell you I think it the least part.\\"Before getting to academics, he addresses dancing, which he believes is useful to a child in many ways; music, which he thinks is not worth the considerable time it takes to master; drawing, which he thinks is a skill every gentleman should possess; swimming, which is salubrious for the health and can save your life; fencing and horseback riding, which are essential gentlemanly skills.Young children need to learn how to read and write. It is important that they learn naturally. Being forced to learn can sour the experience for them and get their whole academic career off to an unfortunate start. Children should be surrounded by reading and writing, and be led to exercise them for pleasure.In this context, children should not be asked to read texts that are beyond their appropriate level of difficulty, or that are foreign to the child's natural interests. He specifically says that any attempt to read the Bible in order would be seriously misplaced. Children should be taught the essential Bible stories such as the story of creation, Abraham and Isaac, Joseph in Egypt, Daniel in the lion's den and so forth in a simple form and in such a way that they tell a moral. In other words, children should be familiar with the Bible as a cultural touchstone of Christian society.Locke was surprisingly modern in his religious views. Rather like the philosophes who followed him and the deists who established the American government, he thought that the Christian religion was a good thing even though he says that there are some items of faith that simply cannot bear scientific investigation. Familiar with gravity from Newton's work, he posited that the great flood might have been caused by a shift in the Earth's center of gravity. But he quickly says that this is the kind of inquiry we ought not to undertake; there is a clear divide between the worlds of natural science and religion, and we make a mistake if we confound the two.Then on to academics. Foreign languages are important in the measure that a person will use them in life. That is saying, the ability to speak a living language is a considerable asset. Knowledge of grammar, he believed, is not nearly so important. Latin is not worth the time that was usually given to it in his age, and Greek is important only for the professional scholar.Locke believed the geography and history were very important. He also believed, contrary to my experience with modern students, that they are intrinsically interesting. He believed that every person should master arithmetic, geometry, and rhetoric. Memorizing long passages in foreign languages, however, and writing poetry he characterizes as fruitless wastes of time, the development of life skills that are simply not remunerative for most people.Concluding his advice on academics, Locke went on to say that the child should be familiar with the manual skills, the crafts such as carpentry, gardening and the like. He advocated that learning manual skills is essential in mental development. He recommended that a child learn bookkeeping, inasmuch as he would someday be in the position of managing an estate.The whole book is written with a great sense of humanity. Locke treats the child as an adult in the process of formation, fully worthy of dignity, not to be beaten or dominated in any way for any purpose other than character development. Locke supports corporal punishment, but only as a last resort, only when authorized by the father, and only upon occasion, to reinforce a specific instruction. His philosophy is quite consistent with the practice in American schools even through the 1960s or 1970s, when Benjamin Spock was ascendant, until the principle of individual responsibility faded as therapeutic schools of child rearing became ascendant. Put another way, Locke believed firmly in free will. Every child is a moral actor, responsible for his own actions, and it is the responsibility of the parent to develop that moral character.I leave it to other reviewers to recite the ways in which Locke's views tie out to those of Aristotle and his other philosophical precursors. To me the news is in how well he outlined the path going forward from his era into our own."},{"Title":"THIS WAS NORMALCY. An Account of Party Politics During Twelve Republican Years: 1920 - 1932.","review":"The author makes no effort to be objective and that is all right. Arthur Schlesinger did three great volumes on the time before and during the New Deal (The Age of Roosevelt: The Crisis of the Old Order 1919-1933; The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal; The Age Of Roosevelt: The Politics of Upheaval) and his view was obvious but they are great books. But this book is short on documentation and long on editorializing, and while I think I would have loved the book in 1948 it does not seem to me that it is effective argumentaion for a good cause."},{"Title":"THIS WAS NORMALCY. An Account of Party Politics During Twelve Republican Years: 1920 - 1932.","review":"The author presents a balanced view of Harding's failed presidency, but fails to offer the same balance to Calvin Coolidge. I believe it was written with what research material was available at the time, with more Coolidge papers now open for inspection and some very intense research published; although the same cannot be said of Harding. It remains in the 21st Century unfortunate that the Harding family continues, through the privately run Harding home museum, to conceal the bulk of the Harding papers (the few left after Florence Harding burned most of them), love letters to Carrie Phillips, and even pictures of the Harding family. The home and website are owned and run by the local Ohio Historical Society, which, in concert with the Harding family, keeps tight control on what is allowed out to the public. Their paltry website is one of the worst for doing online research about a president. Although a National Historic Site, it is not associated with the National Park Service.Nevertheless, Karl Schriftgiesser has correctly presented the facts that Harding should never have been President. He had neither the mind nor the moral stamina for the exalted position. He looked like a president, but he was a little man, a small-town editor, a small-town politician, whose prepossessing facade was a false mask for the emptiness inside. Yet, the American people did not know it then. And when he died, they mourned for him with that outburst of emotion and sentimentality of which the American people are always so capable...not since Abraham Lincoln. They didn't know.The author does a credible job, albeit too brief, of covering the Hoover years, and then, turns in the last chapter, to announce the obituary of Normalcy through the election of F.D.R."},{"Title":"The Eloquence of Living: Meeting Life With Freshness, Fearlessness, and Compassion","review":"The vision required to transform life into eloquent Living is explained by clarifying some key ideas. This small book with each page like a picture frame with a mat around, contains only a few small sentences (upto 5 or 6) on each page. Freedom, Relatedness, Religious Inquiry, Observation, Inner Order, Awareness, Silence, and Meditation are the key chapter/subject titles. Each topic is very well connected to the succeeding theme, providing a well drawn map for understanding. Each of them could be well expanded into a bulky book with commentary. To that extent, this may be a difficult book for a beginner. But, for some one who has already been exposed to life, and has been contemplating for some time, this book can provide a simple summary. Don't expect to sink all these ideas of this book at once into the mind. This book can be on a coffee table for occasional, repeated browsing.Here are some crisp statements from the book.on Freedom:Page 3 :\\"Unless we understand the content of our whole being, freedom cannot be.Freedom is not a speculative, romantic game of imagining something which is not.It is simply comprehension of what is.\\"On Relatedness:Page 21:\\"When you have the humility to be with people in the simplicity of what you are, not pretending to be what you are not, not trying to hide what you are, then communion takes place. You understand the other person more deeply than all knowledge could make possible.\\"On Religious Inquiry:Page 33:\\"The essence of religion is the personal discovery of the meaning of life, the truth of life.\\"Page 46:\\"It's only when we are willing to be vulnerable, unprotected by fixed ideas, traditions, and habitual ways, that the adventure of self-discovery, the inward voyage can begin.\\"On Observation:Page 50:\\"Whenever you use your mind, you have to educate yourself to be there totally, not absentmindedly, half-heartedly, but pouring your whole being into it.To be attentive is to be sensitive.The mind is alert, sensitive, attentive only in the absence of habit.When you go through an event absentmindedly, passively, out of habit, you are not there.The wholeness of your being has missed the opportunity for living.Habit moved, not you.Mechanical repetition creates an illusion of living, but there is neither encounter with life nor growth.\\"Page 58:\\"We are trying to measure human beings with norms or criteria that our minds have prepared yesterday or the thousands of yesterdays of the whole human race.\\"Page 59:\\"To meet another human being is to be attentive, open, vulnerable.It requires being with others in the simplicity of what you are, dropping all manmade pretences and disguises.When you meet another in the simplicity of being, observing rather than reacting, understanding and communion will be there.\\"On Inner Order:Page 65:\\"When the state of observation is sustained, it changes the quality of your biological structure.The nerves are steady, the chemical system has an equilibrium, and there is relaxation, equipoise.You live in the clarity of knowing who you are.\\"Page 73:\\"Living in inner orderliness helps the physical and mental structures become more sensitive.In the midst of noise, you live a quiet life.In the midst of the brutality of comparison, competition, aggression, you live in a simple, noncomparitive, nonaggressive way so that there is minimal psychological disturbances.Sanity emerges in your life, equanimity and balance become the qualities of daily living.\\"On Awareness:Page 81:\\"We know well the conditioned energy of habits, memories, the movement of the past.\\". . . . . . .\\"We do not know the dimension of unconditional relaxation which permits deep understanding of living to take place.\\"On Silence:Page 84:\\"Leaving the shore of word and sound, we plunge into the sea of silence, into space uncluttered by thought, and there we are nourished.\\"Page 87:\\"This nonpersonal, unconditioned intelligence is the nature of life, the whole of it, undefined and indescribable.This intelligence, like beauty, love, sorrow or joy, which are its expressions, cannot be captured in shapes and forms, in definitions and descriptions.All this is why life is worth living.\\"Page 93:\\"Stillness of the mind is one thing and silence, the total relaxation of conscious and unconscious mind into nonaction, is another.\\"On Meditation:Page 101:\\"Those who transcend the duality of silence and sound find themselves in the state of meditation.Meditation is a state where there is no motion whatsoever, not even the movement of awareness or intelligence, not even the awareness that you are one with the universe or one with the totality.In meditation you are at the \\"isness\\" of your being.\\"Page 108:\\"The timelessness of silence, the egolessness of love and compassion are the roots of our life.\\". . . . .\\"Being at the source of life is being free.\\""},{"Title":"The Eloquence of Living: Meeting Life With Freshness, Fearlessness, and Compassion","review":"My son gave me this simple little book for Christmas and I treasure it.

Until his Greenland crossing on skis, few outside of Norway, or Scandinavia at the most, had heard of skiing, although of course it had existed there for centuries. The early chapter of the book on skis and \\"skilobing\\" (skiing) is a marvelous account of the sport, and particularly of Sondre Norheim and the Telemarkers who revolutionized it as recreation.Nansen writes the book in what can only be called a charming tone. He makes the crossing of the icecap seem easy, and indeed, most of the harrowing detail of the expedition relates to the efforts of the party after being dropped off at sea on the east coast of Greenland, through the ice floes with great difficulty, to an eventual landing and a hard climb up to the central ice plateau. There is also considerable detail given about the way of life of the Eskimo and Danish inhabitants of the Greenland west coast, where Nansen and his party overwintered after the crossing.A classic of \\"cold exploration\\" and a lively style and good read after more than a century."},{"Title":"The first Crossing of Greenland","review":"Do not buy from this publisher.

The war in the Pacific)","review":"This copy is another reprint of one of the \\"Green Book\\" series so it doesn't contain any of the great maps that come with the originals."},{"Title":"Ancient Rome: City Planning and Administration","review":"Olivia Robinson is a legal scholar. She's written several books and articles on legal and administrative aspects concerning the Roman period. This book came about, as Robinson relates, from an idea she got from her husband in 1974 when he was working for a Scottish political organization. Oddly, the book wasn't published until 1992, a long time for the amount of information contained in the book. Obviously, this work was not a priority in Robinson's life.The subtitle of this book is \\"City Planning and Administration\\", a fairly broad title that encompasses a lot of material. For the most part, the book is boring and loaded with technical terms, as well as Latin phrases that are not defined. The first few chapters are a real chore to slog through. But soon, the book starts to warm up. Chapters containing such mundane items as bridges, latrines, prostitution and policing become fascinating despite undefined terms. How did Romans bury people or take care of public health? The answers (in part) can be found in this book. It always helps to know that Romans did have public latrines and urinals. The men had it easy, as urinals were cut jars in which one relieved himself. Women apparently had to carry about chamber pots or other devices if they felt the need to go. The urine was sold, mostly to people who used the discharge to clean togas (ring around the collar? No more!). If at home, the waste was collected in buckets and then dumped outside the city or flung into the streets. Other topics include building projects, grain supply, spectacles, sewers and streets, transportation and scads of other stuff. Even though I can't say I cared for the book too much, I did learn a good deal from Robinson.As mentioned above, undefined terms cause serious problems here, making this a book off-limits to beginners. Other problems include a failure to present the city as it probably really was: a stinking cesspool of odor, crime and disease. These things are talked about to some extent, but not given the place they deserve. Robinson actually emphasizes that the abundance of water in the city, as well as baths, led to a squeaky clean population that was concerned about public health. Rome was a dirty, dangerous place, and it should be emphasized as such. Also, Robinson tends to credit most of the maintenance procedures to the aediles, magistrates that concerned themselves with city upkeep. In the later Empire, Robinson believes that these functions were subsumed into the office of the Urban Prefect. This may be true, but Robinson fails to provide a clear explanation of why this occurred.I think a better account of this topic could be written. When studying any subject, there are good books as well as bad ones. While this book doesn't fall into the precipice completely, it could have been much, much better."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It's funny reading the sour grapes reviews written by what I am sure is America's worst generation yet. Ironically the worst generation blames Brokaw for seeing through rose colored glasses while they (the worst) see through diarrhea covered glasses of their own. I guess that's not surprising from a group that has no degree of introspection. Take some of the following - \\"the WWII generation was the generation of segregation and racism.\\" In fact the WWII generation was the generation that rose above racism. The civil rights bill (passed in 1964) was a reflection of the time that most Americans wanted institutional racism and segregation to end. This generation has stained its memory by changing civil rights into a gentler kinder racism that makes excuses for minorities when they fail, and expects less from minorities then they do from themselves. It's white supremacy without the hate.Certainly some of the complaints about Eastern Europe and deficit spending have validity. However, I see little improvement from this generation. Plenty of my contemporaries see the huge burden of taxes necessary to continue this safety net with growing holes. It's not like there are too many people saying - we will shift for ourselves and the government should go back to its more limited roles.There are reviewers who blame the WWII generation for being isolationist and leaving Eastern Europe in the lurch after the war. Meanwhile some generation X-ers and baby boomers today blame the US for recent terrorist attacks (in true spirit of blaming the victim). \\"We arrogantly impose ourselves and our ways on others\\" - they say. O.K. but joining WWII earlier or pushing the Russians out of Eastern Europe certainly would have been imposing. Seems your damned if you do and damned if you don't.The Greatest Generation is a title conveying reverence and humility for an older generation who gave us relatively comfortable and secure lives. Not surprising the worst generation seems to miss this - they have no humility."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw glosses over a very important subject and shows his political colors readily. It is unfortunate that the same subject has not yet been treated by a more serious and professional author."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw has wriiten quite a good book using the common men and women as the forces of retrospection. Of course, he only mentions people he knew or came across in the generation, missing out a lot of others.The only comment I would like to make is that Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr should not be included or mentioned. Schlesinger was an historian but to me, he never measured up to the greatness of William Prescott, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Arnold J. Tonybee or Barbara Tuchman. He didn't seem to have fired a single shot or shed a drop of blood during the War. His work at the OSS during the War was quite hazy and murky. I am quite disgusted with his biased and one-sided opinion of the Kennedys"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Important book, well-intentioned, beautifully appointed, for both casual and research purposes. Brokaw is a very strong writer, in great command of the American language, as he always demonstrates on TV with his resonant speaking voice.I wrote above, well-intentioned...but not well-conceived: \\"greatest\\" is in the psyche of the beholder. I know alot of Vietnam Veterans who would absolutely have demonstrated the same level of courage as the most courageous of the World War II Heroes.I found the format to be fun, but the titles of the different sections was pretty juvenile: the very short section involving Minorities is titled \\"Shame\\". Yes, intellectually, we *get it*. But what a poor choice for a Heading.Ofcourse, Brokaw cannot list all of the \\"greatest\\". Richard Nixon, in his Memoir, said he was no Hero as a CO. But he chose potential combat rather than stay in Iowa. I'll look again but there are *no* positive comments about Nixon in this book. Perhaps hisb experience did not warrant a Chapter but a soldier in harm's way is no-one to dismiss (\\"yeah, 'Watergate'.......)."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was excited to finally get my hands on this book to read it and learn more about the generation I know least about. However, I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Brokaw repeatedly tried to point out characteristics of that generation that I clearly did not see and that I have seen many times over in other generations. When he states that the integrity and work ethic of that generation is not seen today, I am offended and appalled. That kind of position is not only wrong but harmful. The parents and youth of today have not had to deal with a draft- to no fault of their own - however they have had many other obstacles to face that did not automatically make them heroes. I was angered and disappointed by this book. It was neither informative nor inspiring."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book ie okay but it is boring to Ilike some of it but some of it is confusing to me. There are a lot of people in this book and it is hard to keep up with all the people in the book. The pictures in the book are good too. They help you get a better picture of where the book is and what the people look like. The book is hard to understand but you get into it in the middle. Then it gets confusing again. There is a little boy who is with his father and his father is on a base for his army. The little boy gets to experience some things at a young age. One of the other good parts is that the title fits and it just tells what the chapter is going to tell you about. The book could be better but it is okay from where it is at.

Although it features some stirring stories of bravery and compassion (hence the two stars), every word of it is poured over with syrup and then carelessly vomited onto the page. Only about half of the words in this book are necessary at all to the context of the stories it tells; the rest are flag-waving literary masturbation. Consider sentences like these:\\"Millions of men and women were involved in this tumultous journey through adversity and achievement, despair and triumph. Certainly there were those who failed to measure up, but taken as a whole this generation did have a 'rendezvous with destiny' that went well beyond the outsized expectations of President Roosevelt when he first issued that call to duty in 1936.\\"Yes, I get it, Grandma and Grandpa were great! Now please, sir, learn how to structure a sentence! Most of the rest of the book is mindlessly self-indulgent treacle in this repetitive vein.

We have had individuals display similar patriotism throughout our history, especially since World War II. A recent example is Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinal Safety who give up millions to join the Army Rangers and gave his life in Afghanistan.

What about the founders of our country who fought so desperately on the American frontier long before any of us were born..

Your book, a shameless effort to capitalize on the wellspring of emotion generated by Hollywood's latest foray into WWII (i.e. Saving Private Ryand, Thin Red Line), doesn't hold a candle to Terkel's Pulitzer Prize winner.

In short, what about the very people who made it possible for there to even be an American WWII generation? In my opinion, the WWII generation earns a different title: The Most Arrogant Generation. Remember they also gave us the Cold War, McCarthyism and Segregation. It was also men of the WWII generation who &quot;led&quot; the nation into Vietnam.

Where might he have led us? A builder? A teacher? A scholar? A novelist? A musician? I sometimes think the biggest price we pay for war is what might have been.&quot;Whoops! Wrong book! That's from Ambrose's &quot;The Victors&quot;, pp. 353-354. Must be my Old Timer's disease acting up again.I meant to quote Brokaw, p. 11: &quot;They know how many of the best of their generation didn't make it to their early twenties, how many brilliant scientists, teachers, spiritual and business leaders, politicians and artists were lost in the ravages of the greatest war the world has seen.&quot;Perhaps imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery. After all, you can't expect a talking head to have an original idea, and the entire approach to this &quot;book&quot; was borrowed from Ambrose's series of books about WW2. What bothers me even more is that Brokaw had the chutzpah to accept a Patriots Award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Do talking heads have a conscience?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is a collection of short biographies of ordinary and famous American who came of age during World War II. In his introduction, Brokaw explains that he developed an enduring respect for people of this generation upon visiting battle sites of the Normandy invasions with American veterans. He wrote this book as a tribute to all members of the World War II generation, both those who served their country in uniform, and those who supported the war efforts at home. Included are profiles of veterans wounded in the war, describing how they learned to deal with their handicaps once they returned home. Also included are stories of war widows and women who entered the workforce during the war, as well as stories of African American soldiers who served in segregated units and Japanese Americans who were interned in camps in the Southwest.Brokaw explores the concept of \\"hero\\", noting that it is so often ordinary people who perform heroic acts, and that to him, all of the people profiled here are heroes. (Perhaps for that reason, all of the stories told here are success stories, and Brokaw doesn't delve into what happens when ordinary people find themselves unable to deal with the extraordinary stresses of war. In this book, the veterans all came back and led settled family lives, without seeming to suffer inordinately from psychological traumas, without divorce, alcoholism, or physical abuse.) What comes through clearly is that this was a unique generation, who shared a common experience of crisis of immense magnitude with their peers around the world that no generation before or since has had to face."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down.

A WWII vet who left high school to fight in the war and didn't get a HS diploma until 2000 when the local high school included him in their graduating class. The book is a collection of stories of different WWII veterans and what became of them in the years since. Some of them are famous people (George Bush, Andy Rooney and Daniel Inouye)and some are not. It describes the character of the people that almost overflows into a whole generation of people. At 41 yrs old, I don't see that kind of character in my generation and if the same situation were to arise today I'm not sure we'd see the same sort of response. Not many of my contemporaries would have left high school to go fight on the other side of the world as my next door neighbor did. I generally grade books on how well I feel the time I spent reading them was spent... and in this case I feel it could not have been spent better.

Having lost both of my grandparents, it makes my heart ache a little to think that I never knew the actual enormity of accomplishments he and the rest of their generation contributed to our country- our world- while they were still here.Both of my grandparents were humble and definitely not the excessive, hoarding, exhorbitant consumers that our generation is. Many of the stories from this book give you a real appreciation for that, now, rare characteristic.After reading this, I am not only more profoundly proud of our country, but I also look at our elders with a different set of eyes and I can only think, \\"thank you for paving the way\\".It also makes me wish I had asked more questions and wanted to learn more of values and characteristics of my grandparents. So now, I am left with this book and will evermore hope to soak in whatever I can from the remaining folks of that generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I bought this book for my husband who is so patriotic, and values his country and its defenders of freedom to the highest degree. He is thoroughly enjoying this book. Mr. Brokaw seems to have captured his attention very well."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"After reading this book I have so much admiration for this generation.

I purchased this for my Dad. He was part of that generation. Many thanks!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's book is a revelation to those of us who came of age from the middle 50's on. The individuals included in the book are well-chosen and representative of a cross-section of America at war. I was privileged to have been married to a man of this generation -- and I thought I understood what he was about: there's some- thing to be done, so you just do it. The book reaffirms my thoughts about him. I am ordering two additional copies -- one for each of his sons, my stepsons. It was only in the two years before his death that they came close to understanding what their father was about. I think reading Tom Brokaw's book will enlarge their understanding."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book helps us baby boomers understand many of the actions of our parents. As products of the Depression, they knew hardships that for us have only been chapter headings in books. We and our children will never know those hardships that they endured. By the same token, we cannot know the fear that they must have faced on December 7, 1941, when the previously &quot;impenetratable&quot; United States was attacked. As horrible as that act was, it was the one act that solidified that generation and also seems to be the thing we Baby Boomers search for every night on the evening news. There has been no single news event since then to equal Pearl Harbor. Despite the realisitc fighting displayed every night on televisions across America during the VietNam War, nothing can compare to that hellish attack on Pearl Harbor and all that it did to solidify this nation. My only criticism of this generation is their failure to see quickly enough what was going on in Germany to eliminate all that was not Aryan. Similar criticisms will be levelled at our generation in years ahead when it comes to Bosnia, Africa and China. While I agree with Mr. Brokaw that this generation has little to be proud of in the area of race relations or women's rights, no generation since then can be equalled in ite zeal for service to country, community and family."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I bought this book for my husband as a gift. Since he no longer enjoys readinganything too lengthy, he was delighted to see how the book is divided up intomany separate stories. He started reading it right away and hasn't stopped. Since we are in the senior citizen catagory, he is really enjoying reading about people whose lives coincide with our own history. I look forward to it's being my turn to read."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Excellent book with profiles of folks who survived WWII and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves. The format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Although I don't always agree with him, Brokaw deserves great credit for documenting and immortalizing some of the people who comprise the Greatest Generation.As more and more of these great warriors pass on every day, we are losing the collective memories and recollections of these people at an astonishing rate. The fact that they were shaken from their near-universal silence to finally share their most disturbing memories and deepest fears is a tribute to Tom Brokaw. He made it \\"all right\\" to talk about what happened and posterity will be the beneficiary of these witnesses to living history.The War was their defining accomplishment but struggling and surviving through the Great Depression was no walk in the park either. This double-barreled challenge was enough to sink any generation but these folks were made of sterner stuff. They persevered and they prevailed and they came home to rebuild America and raise a family. Many used the benefits of the GI Bill to get an education that was once beyond their reach. They then went about the business of converting a potent war production machine into a vibrant and thriving peacetime economy.Some have accused them of raising a generation of whining and selfish offspring, The Baby Boomers. I don't agree. Giving their children the security they fought for and material advantages they never had was the most natural thing for them to do. And not all Boomers are self-centered narcissists. After all, some of them did put a man on the moon.So in defense of the Greatest Generation with regard to their offspring, most of us will never know \\"what it's like to be 22 years old and already know that you will never do anything more important for the rest of your life than what you have already done?\\" (Quoted from The Last Jump - Page 505)The book is fabulous and the stories are deeply personal and revealing. They simply engender more respect and honor for these great citizens. And it pays respect to the often-forgotten women who made such an outstanding contribution to the ultimate victory.And it was Tom Brokaw who took the great risk of recording some painful memories and in the process unleashed the torrent of repressed recollections of many other aging veterans. The Veteran Oral Histories Project Act (Public Law 106-380) passed in 2000 funded the recording of the experiences and memories of many veterans who were set free by the highly positive public adulation to The Greatest Generation published 2 years prior.

Very Very Humbling."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I'm not a big fan of Brokaw the broadcaster, but Brokaw the anchor, with this book, has produced an American Classic. Aside from the Founding Fathers themselves, the WWII generation truly was America's greatest."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I wanted to love this book and place it on a pedestal. The concept of young adults (such as my father) steeled during the Great Depression, rising to the occasion in World War II to do what needed to be done and often more, and then coming home to better themselves, their families, communities, and country is a wonderful story. If not the Greatest Generation of all, they were among the best that our country can produce. In fact, while the era was tainted by injustice at home, the men and women of this generation were the ones that really led the post-war battles for social equality. Being a baby-boomer myself, Brokaw's book adds a lot of substance and meaning to the adults around during my childhood. I wonder how many of the often distant and stern and sometimes opaque men of my neighborhood and elsewhere were heroes with stories as inspiring as those told by Brokaw. My father never talked much about the War and I wonder what he could tell me of his time in Europe.In the sense of being a tribute to its subject, \\"The Greatest Generating\\" is a success. Unfortunately there is a big \\"however.\\" Basically, \\"The Greatest Generation\\" is a 5 Star concept that fell short in execution. The book consists of many profiles that are several pages in length. Each one generally tells the story of where the person came from, his or her service during World War II, re-entry into civilian society, and how the whole process affected one's life, ambitions, and ideals. Most of these are interesting to read and Brokaw does convey his message that they were people to be admired with something to teach younger generations. However as I progressed through the book, the individual parts of it seemed stronger than the whole. The problem is that the profiles appeared more and more repetitive and superficial as the book went on (I recently read Brokaw's \\"Boom\\" and had similar criticisms). Often, just as a subject person became very interesting and his story moving, the book would go on to somebody else. Perhaps Brokaw should have covered few people in more detail, but I am sure he felt overwhelmed by the number of stories to tell. This book is good, just not up to my expectations. Based on a 5 star concept and 3 star execution, I give it 4 Stars."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I first got this one as a book on tape to listen to during the daily commute. Several stories had me staying in my car a good 5 to 10 min after I had parked in my home drive way.Tom Brokaw does tend to bring out the better aspects of this generation by concentrating his bioghraphy on its better members. Leaving out things like the black market or the rampant racism of the era. However, I feel in a society that dwells on the negative it is kind of refreshing to celebrate those with bravery, compassion, prudence, and integrity.The book is a collection of great stories about generally good but not always perfect people."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I enjoy reading about the experiences of my grandfather's generation. They went through so much, yet accomplished more than any generation ever.

I truly enjoyed reading and learning about the people who fought in the war, the workers in the factories , to the how the people were affected at home. The author did a wonderful job of looking at all the aspects surrounding the war and not from the offical aspect. I think all Americans should be proud of what this generation has left for us. I truly enjoyed reading this book and learned a great new respect for everyone of their generation. Folks who know nothing of WORLD WARII should read this book it might teach them as it did me about the people of that generation. Thank you for this book Mr. Brokaw !!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a great book that introduces you REAL American heroes. They're not heroes because they can shoot a basket or hit a ball - they worked hard, played hard, and (to our benefit) fought hard. These people remind you that July 4th is the celebration of our freedom and not just a day off work. The layout of the book makes it easy to pick up where you left off. I really enjoyed it, sure wish it was required reading in schools."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's book &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is not a book of war and bad times as some might say, but it is a book I feel to portray that during the slaughter of D-day, and even though other countries were stuggling, our country stood united under a cause. Major progress was made. Women entered the workforce more fully, people were dying in loyalty to their country. What other generation or counry can you think of that was like this? I feel this book was an excellent one for future generations to read."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I never really knew much about the generation that came of age in the Great Depression and WWII but now I have a clear understanding of a self-sacrificing and a special generation that is almost unequaled in human history. Their stories were captivating and inspiring. They made me appreciate the turmoil and chaos that they went through to protect this world from two of the most bloodthirsty governments to ever exist. I would have given the book five stars but I felt that it maybe &quot;put-down&quot; the current generation too much by making it seem insignificant next to the WWII generation. I feel that this generation owes a lot to the WWII generation but to compare them is wrong. However, I felt that this was a great book and a very worthwhile read. Hey, you might even learn a thing or two about your grandparents."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw certainly captured the spirit of the 30's and 40's and he went right to the horse's mouth to do it.He offers biographial sketches of the big and the small, the rich and the poor who shared a common life defining experience in WW11. A wonderful gift book for the sons and daughters and grandchildren of this wonderful generation who took it all in stride and returned to devote a lifetime to continuing to build a strong America."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am a student of history and knew the facts involving World War II before reading this book. But this book brought the war home to me, making me see it through the eyes of everyday people who were shaped by and helped to shape the events I have studied. I laughed and cried reading the various stories within this book. It also did something even more important for me. My father and mother are members of the generation shaped by the Great Depression and World War II. I now feel I understand them better because of Mr. Brokaw's book. It explained so much for me that I was never able to understand before about their views and actions. So many times, when I was reading this book, I said to myself, &quot;This is my father or mother.&quot; For that understanding and for the throughly enjoyable weekend I spent reading The Greatest Generation, I thank Mr. Brokaw."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As those of us who were born during &quot;the War&quot; look back upon history we realize how truly fortunate we were to have adults of that period as mentors, teachers, parents and friends. Brokaw does a good job of telling their stories. Some stories are similar and some portions are repeated and for those reasons the book tends to lose excitement. Not everything that is good is exciting, however. The book is interesting (I knew some of those people) and I would recommend it to any young person. If they read it, they will then know how many truly great sacrifices were made for us by those who were young adults during the war. A good book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As Tom Brokaw said many times, the veterans didn't think they had done anything special &amp; the people on the homefront did what they had to do also. As a baby boomer I have first hand experience of this, but really didn't understand it until reading this book. I hope all baby boomers will read this &amp; come to understand their parents better. A fine effort by Mr. Brokaw."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I have only skimmed the book thus far, but just wanted to respond to the critic who feels he has discovered the truth about Brokaw. The truth being that he wrote the book to cater to the generation most likely to &quot;by&quot; it. Learn to spell before you criticize someone else's writing. I guess members of the over priviledged generation are at a loss when their spell checkers are not there to help them.As for the critic who feels the generation born in the 1920's created more problems than they solved, I'd like to point out the fact that hindsight is 20/20 and that actions involve reactions that can rarely be predicted. But I guess you could have mobilized for global warfare without burning fossil fuels. And you could have protected a nation and its people from an aggressive enemy without entering into a cold war or Vietnam. You also could have helped those in need face the rising costs of medical care with funds that don't come from taxpayer's pockets. The men and women of that generation gave their lives to protect the basic freedoms which you take for granted. In short, you now have the priviledge to debate these topics because of them, so show some respect."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a must read by all generations. It does get a little repetative with some of the stories but that is ok since each has its own nuiance. If all generations would read this and then see Saving Private Ryan it would help all to understand what WWII was all about. I suspect, however, that our slick Willie wouldn't understand or even comprehend what it was all about!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The book itself isn't bad - as bad as I would have expected from a media talking head.The problem is that the whole premise of the book seems to be a way for baby boomers to redeem themselves by attaching themselves to the people who fought World War II. This from a generation that never gave a thought for its own children, that trashed their parents until - surprise, surprise, they realized they're growing old, too. So now, all that is old is wonderful, when 30 years ago, all that is young was wonderful.So, while the baby boomers make themselves feel good, yet again, it'll be up to the generations after them to clean up their messes.More books like this will start pouring out as baby boomers realize their own mortality and start searching for ways to make themselves look better."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"3 Stars for Brokaw merely stumbles upon a story without understanding or research that shows in some of his facts (in typical NBC fashion). &quot;Citizen Soldier&quot; by S. Ambrose does a much better job of describing actual European Theater Operations (ETO) action. Must not forget the men and women of the Pacific Theater as well. A better book would be &quot;D-Day&quot;, also by Ambose, who describes both the incredible story of the invasion at Normandy and the indisputable heroism of that generation. To the 16 year old, take up one of the above mentioned books. You will not want to skip around in these. Awesome. 5 Stars for this generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I think it is convenient that Brokaw picked a relatively current generation to be the greatest of all human history (as if such a choice is really possible). What about the Sumerians in living in 3100 BC with their cities and agriculture? What about the Europeans during the Renaissance? Or those who faced the hardships of the plague? Or those who created the civilizations in China and Japan? Not to take away from Brokaw's subjects but calling any one generation the &quot;Greatest&quot; is arbitrary and impossible."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw: Your book on the Greatest Generation was fine and entertaining reading. You should feel great satisfaction that these people finally received the recognition that was due them. On page XXX of the prologue you mentioned that veterans were dying at the rate of 3200 a month. These figures do not add up. If there are appox. six million veterans living then it would take fifty more years or more for them to pass away. I think the V.A. wanted to tell you 32,000 a month. With this figure the actuary rate would be more in line with the remaining people now alive. John Delzenero"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I thought Mr. Brokaw took a somewhat condescending attitude to some of these stories by seriously overplaying every possible good quality of these individuals. I started to wonder if these were real humans who accomplished extraordinary things or creations of the author's imagination. I am not arguing with the basic premise that this was an extraordinary generation of people, I just wish the author would have told a more complete story on fewer people and had not thrown in so many cliche compliments. By staying so much on the surface of these people's lives,he did not do them justice and the stories began to sound repetitive. I also noticed that Mr. Brokaw's writings on these people, especially the prominent ones, was colored by his personal political leanings. He seemed to celebrate those whose political beliefs are consistent with his, and apologize or make excuses for those who's positions don't (read Danial Inoye's &amp; Bob Dole's stories for examples). Mr. Brokaw's respect and reverence for the men &amp; women who won WWII is justified &amp; touching. This was a book that needed to be written. I just wish a more polished and serious writer (Steven Ambrose?) had written it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A lot of reviews make the book's simplicity of style a negative. what a surprise since it doesn't read like textbook and in fact makes history more human, and to me, more significant."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My father served in Europe during WW II. Like many other G. I.'s he returned home with a foreign-born wife. It was very disappointing that there was no mention of soldiers and their war brides in this book. The individual stories are good as far as they go, but Brokaw trivializes them with the same flowery comments repeated again and again. Some celebrity stories such as Art Buchwald's were very entertaining, but other celebrity names were mentioned without an account of the individual's experiences. Would you call that name dropping? I agree with all the other reviewers who liked the stories but found them pooly written."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Don't bother reading this book. Brokaw's sham will teach you nothing about the Second World War. Instead, read Studs Terkel's THE GOOD WAR or anything by Paul Fussell. Better yet, go talk to a veteran...We're lucky they're still around."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"When I finally did get around to reading this huge bestseller, I was met with pretty much what I had expected...a breezy, movie-like collection of WWII memories. What this 35-year old gets from Mr. Brokaw's book is that the generation that fought World War II was more honest, harder-working, more dedicatated to their spouses, and more blindly patriotic than succeeding generations. I wouldn't wish to ever take anything away from those that defeated fascism in the 1940s, but this book pushes a near-utopian view of mid-20th century American values that's hard to swallow. It seems to suffer from two key problems: a selective bias as to what kind of biographes Brokaw would include, and an unwillingness to possibly offend the generation being profiled.If this book was all that you ever read about the WWII-generation, you could be forgiven for thinking that veterans never suffered from crushing emotional problems, alcoholism, unemployment or broken marriages. Negative stories of this kind are mostly swept aside in favor of those that fit in with a Hollywood &quot;happily ever after&quot; notion of post-war America in which the high school sweetheart always waited faithfully for her man to return home. While this scenario clearly hapened many times, it's ridiculous to paint an entire generation with this simple broad brush. Even Hollywood movies made during this generation's heyday were more honest. Take a look at &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, made in 1946.In a way, it's almost a disservice to treat this generation in such a shallow format. Most of the people profiled are given a mere two or three pages to render an entire life's history. Clearly, too short a space in which to deal with complex societal issues, but a length that's just right if all you're going to do is reenforce simple notions of duty, honor and country.I really think that Brokaw's heart was in the right place. He clearly wanted to give these folks their just due, but his effort is far from hard-hitting or completely honest."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Story after story, I was amazed at what took place, at what people did with their lives. The Greatest Generation is a perfect title to describe such a group of people.I'm comparatively very young. I'm right in the middle of the so-called generation X. After reading this book, I realized that we owe much, so very, very much to our parents and grandparents.I thought I knew history. I thought I knew what happened. I didn't. I only knew the historical details and facts, not personal stories. Now I know that the details and facts I learned in college don't amount to much at all, and no history lesson is going to ever teach you that. This book will.I'm somewhat ashamed of my own generation, and I'm very honored to know a little more of a prior generation that deserves FAR more credit than we X'ers give them. This is an excellent book. This will force you to reconsider the value of your parents and grandparents, no matter how you think you already value them. I wonder what my generation will be called in 40-50 years. I doubt the word Greatest will be used, and least not in a positive light.When you finish one story, you will either put away the book just to consider in amazement what you've just read, or you'll hasten to read another story, and then another, and then another. All are excellent!Believe me - I'm not a big history fan, but I loved every square inch of this book. I treasure this book. I think everyone will."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The generation that Brokaw wrote have been through World War I and II. All the people listed in the book have moved me to look beyond how the wars have affected America. Americans are real people.

Their life &amp; times, trials &amp; stamina through the Depression, war(s), and raising families. I wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book. As it is, Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story. I hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than Brokaw, who has little talent as a writer. I was very disappointed reading this book and I made the mistake of buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend &amp; neighbors, and my own Father without pre-reading it. Live and learn, I guess. Sorry, I had expectations of being thrilled with this book...but wasn't."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Readers who want to enumerate each and every fault of a particular generation (and every generation has faults!) must consider, for just a moment, what earth-shattering accomplishments that this particular generation has achieved. Yes, there are some issues for which no one is proud, but one must view them in the larger context of preserving freedom in the world--and, curiously, in bringing about new freedoms to many people who had been deprived of them in the past."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Being born the son of one of &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; I share the belief that those who defended our country in the largest conflict known to man, are well desired of any praise afforded then. In this, Mr. Brokaw and I agree. I'll go futher to say; any book that preports to accomphish such a task is will worth picking up. I do take exception through when the author, a well-respected television journalist, uses as a front so noble a subject for not only his own self-promotion, but to air his political views as well. In addition, the simplistic manner in which the book is written makes it more a chore to read that had it been done in a more literate style. Anyone needing a real taste of how this style of book should be written, need look no further than that masterpiece dealing with this same generation, &quot;Hard Times,&quot; written by Studs Terkel.It appears Mr. Brokaw has forgotten the one cardinal rule the recorder of history is ultimately committed to providing, naming, stating the facts. His constant editorializing on the failings of the Republican party adds nothing to the content of his writting and serves to relegate the book to his own private soap box from which to wave banner of the Democratic party which he has firmly cleched in his teeth. In segment after segment, be they deal with what transpired severty years past or within the last few years, he never misses an opportunity to paint those of the Republican persuasion in a negative light. He further goes on to to be insensitive enough to include a photograph of the current President of the United States before one's even gotten into the first chapter. Over the course of the next fifty years Mr. Clinton's generation will surely not be viewed with the same reverence as that this book is dedicated to. The reverse is probalby more likely, and as such, Mr. Brokaw has unwittingly provided a touching, through unintentional piece of irony, for Mr. Cliton does represent all the oppostie of &quot;Great&quot; within his generation.Continuing in the same vein of using his work as a personal platform, the author provides us constant reminders as to just who wrote this piece of work. Providing his readers numerous glimpses of himself; as television reporter, as small boy, as the journalist in Normandy,(not once, by twice) as husband, as son, and even as television game show contestant. He manages to include most of the Brokaw clan within the narative, missing only poor old Uncle Claude, who no doubt pumped gas at the local Flying A station in Yankton. In the event the reader is completly incoherant about who the author is, Mr. Brokaw has his name promenently displayed at the top of and centered on every other page.In the final analysis, this book fails to fully recognize the greatness a generation captured. It does capture the animosity the author holds for individuals of a particular political party and for exposing the reader to the rankest form of self promotion."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"GOOD INSIGHT OF WHAT THOSE YOUNG BOYS WENT THROUGH AND HOW THEY CAME HOME AND SETTLED IN LIFE.

Tom Brokaw's writing style flowed very smoothly and stayed focused on the cogent point of each saga.I was inspired by what I read and this is most likely another book that should be on the \\"must read\\" list for today's younger generations.My overall rating was more likely closer to a 4.5 (can't do that with the stars). The only drawback (minor) was the inclusion of a few stories that seemed forced and didn't appear to be consistent with the caliber of the rest of the other powerhouse stories.Overall, I think readers will find this book fast-paced (with each person's contribution in short chapters), informative of the circumstances that the subjects overcame/exploited, and largely inspirational."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I enjoyed this book far more than I expected to. I found myself reading until midnight to finish it. I remember those days and Brokaw captures the period extremely well which I would expect of his writing. The individual excerpts on Bob Dole, George Shultz. etc. was especially interesting."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This biographically oriented work focuses on the experiences of common as well as famous individuals. The experiences of African Americans, Japanese-Americans, and women are included. This book also includes many photographs.War-related issues are mentioned, but are not the main subject of this book. One clarification is needed. Two American POWs of the Germans crossed German-occupied Poland, and reckoned that Polish doctors had been conscripted by the Germans. (pp. 30-31). In actually, Polish doctors had been murdered or sent to concentration camps, to die slowly there, as part of the then-selective Nazi genocide of the best elements of Polish society.As the soldiers came home, their lives unfolded before them: Marriage and children, religion, businesses and the workplace, participation in local politics, VHF, Little League, Scouts, etc.As the tumultuous 1960's rolled around, the proverbial generation gap took effect. Parents could not understand why their children did not share their values. The Vietnam War played a divisive role as well.Society changed in various other ways. People forgot to be responsible for their actions. Patriotism became pass&eacute;. Divorce became common, and the parents could not come to terms with the dissolution of their adult children's marriages.Life was not always easy. Nevertheless, this is more than a book about the Greatest Generation. It is Americana at its best."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Good price and the book arrived in a timely fashion - however, it was listed as new and the corners of the book cover on the spine were bent and kind of beat-up looking. Luckily the pages were pristine so I still gave it as a gift, but it shouldn't have been listed as new in the first place. Otherwise, good service."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book provides a great deal of insight into the lives and character of those individuals that lived through the ww2 period. Except for the obligatory chapters, required by political correctness, of individuals that didn't do or contribute anything other than just live in that period, I feel that this is a very worthwhile book. As Brokow pointed out, the greatest insights come from comparing today's generation with those individuals from the greatest generation. And that forces all of us to comtemplate what the future will be like with our current generation in charge. We can only hope for the best."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I preface my remarks by saying that as a foreigner and as a citizen of a pathologically 'neutral', state I have no first hand or cultural knowledge of what it must have been like to live through a War as catastrophic as World War II. However, part of my motivation in reading this book was to get a greater sense of the 'home front' aspects of war and since I like Mr. Brokaw's tabloid style of journalism I felt I was on to a winner. Although eminently readable as expected, there was, after Chapter 3 or so, a sameness to each bite-sized vignette that eventually lead me to discard the book in annoyance. I never finished the wretched thing ! In short, repetition is Mr. Brokaw's greatest sin and while he established firmly the decency, ordinariness and patriotism of the Greatest Generation, he did them no great service by effectively imbuing them with an undeserved tag of 'Boring' as well !"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I will be the first to admit that Tom Brokaw has a place in my heart and in that of most of America. Unfortunately however, his book does not. Though it offers a much deserved tribute to a great generation- and perhaps a much more important lesson to the youth of today- it was at many points a tedious and dull read.Conceptually it was interesting. Breaking it down into life synopsis' of those who were there was brilliant. However, they often read like a bad book report. &quot;Here are the facts of this peron's life. Done.&quot; James Bradley's 'Flags of our Fathers' will leave you feeling much more obliged to the Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Although less journalistic and more tributary in nature, this book hearkens back to a time that people of my generation still yearn for; a diffuse monochrome tapestry of what was once an ideal and simpler time. Or was it? Certainly there was greater emphasis placed on drawing distinctions between right and wrong, good and evil; but it seems that my memory, not unlike this book, perhaps, suffers a bit from reflective glossing. It's unlikely that any soldier sprawled out face-first on a French beachhead was reminiscing fondly about how good his life had been to that point. But certainly the demarcation lines were more clearly illustrated...Hitler was a malevolent sociopath and Churchill, a divine leader. I just wished this book had fleshed-out more of those gray areas. In fact, I recently had the opportunity to read a story about our most contemporary conflict, the war on drugs. A war, I might add, that is being fought not in the Jungles of Colombia or in the streets of LA, but rather, it is being fought in the hallowed corridors of Corporate America. Unlike &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; this book seems to capture the multiple hues of gray that speckle the American canvas. The book, \\"Inside Job: Deep Undercover as a Corporate Spy,\\" was one of the most engrossing and moving stories it has been my displeasure to read. That's right, the zeitgeist of this tortuous tale of ambiguous ethics and diffuse corporate operations is such that it captures best what is so different about society today versus fifty years ago. Read both of these books back-to-back and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Intriguing notion of getting a feel for the events that shaped &quot;the greatest generation&quot;, but the utter lack of depth in these vignettes really does a disservice, not only to the reader, but to the subjects of the vignettes themselves. These people obviously are so interesting, have had such intense experiences--why does Brokaw allow them each two or three pages? Disappointing to be sure."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I enjoyed the variety of stories told by our veterans, especially their remarkable stamina and creativity. Very moving and fascinating. If you like this book, try Letters from the Good War by Hugh Aaron, right from the horses mouth, beautifully told stories told while it was happening. Takes you there."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book highlights, so well, the life of our family during wartime. Having lived on an army base during WWII, I have memories of black outs, rationing, etc., but this book highlights for me , additionally, the strength of my parents, my aunts and uncles during that wartorn time. Recommend additional reading of HUGHITT STREET, author, Packy Eckola,"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead, read Studs Terkel's &quot;The Good War.&quot; It &quot;is&quot; what Brokaw could have &quot;had&quot;, if he would have imitated the master oral biographer."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw may have a point, but I pause before completely agreeing with him on the premise of the title. It's hard for me to separate the subject generation from the ones that fought the Civil War or the First World War. I personally think that this country's greatest generation may have been the one that produced our remarkable Declaration of Independence and our Constitution, and then ensured that the government they formed would allow for the potential growth of each succeeding generation. As a member of the Baby Boomers, I'm not certain that my generation, as a whole, appreciates the gift each preceding generation has passed to us. Thus, the importance of such a book by Brokaw, or related works such as Ambrose's, Ryan's and Terkel's histories of WWII events. Such writings allow us each to reflect whether the leaders we are forced to choose today as a matter of economics really have the vision and character to bring this country forward, in the manner that the preceding generations envisioned. This is where the greatness of a generation comes from, the leaders during its formulative years and the leaders it in turn produces. As I said, this book is a good read.....but try Bruce Catton's Army of the Potomac trilogy (Mr. Lincoln's Army, Glory Road and A Stillness at Appomattox) and see if the resemblance to the Civil War veteran doesn't argue for a smilar &quot;greatest generation&quot;."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Unfortunately, this book is just a series of repetitive &quot;snippets&quot; that really does little to tell the story of this generation. I am about Brokaw's age and my parents and their brothers and sisters numbered 17 in total. I have heard all the stories, and have three uncles buried in Europe. I found Brocaw with little talent (this book could have been done by a mediocre college sophomore) and a love for &quot;Brocaw&quot;. Never have I seen a &quot;talking head&quot; lever his TV exposure to the extent this guy has. He, like a lot of his generation gave little, reaped plenty and are looking for legitimacy via the accomplishments of their parents.Also, please note he put his name on every other page. Really a tacky work. The &quot;ME&quot; generation is true to form !!!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's book will grip you from the beginning and remind you of members of your family who sacrificed through a time unlike any other in history. This generation (age 60's and 70's now) had a remarkable desire to persevere while under unfortunate circumstances yet lived on to build respectable lives where hard-work and integrity abound. Five star book &amp; try to catch the 1 hour MSNBC special featuring some of the book's examples."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"An excellent tribute to those whom we owe a debt of gratitude and the many more that are not mentioned due to space constrictions.Read this book and then reread it each Veterans' Day as a reminder of what brave people have done in the past and to appreciate the importance of your own continuing role in our country by maintaining standards of personal integrity.An excellent book by an excellent newsman."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"David Letterman put it most succinctly - If you don't buy this book, there is something wrong with you. It is a great book and should be read by every American. It inspires us to be more like our parents and grandparents, a generation that didn't always have its hand out for something it was &quot;entitled to&quot;. These people gave everything they had for the cause of freedom, and against oppression"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The beginning and ending narrative touched my heart being from the great state of South Dakota and having walked many small cemeteries where veterans flags and tombstones mark the sites of our fallen. Other than that the stories were shallow and uninteresting, lacking depth and insight of the effect of the war on these individuals. Let's face it, post war prosperity brought these veterans the success they enjoy today. I don't think it had much to do with their military experiences. Joe Foss was not revered by South Dakotans to any extent and throwing Al Neuharth in was really clutching at straws.Really it was the parents of these WWII veterans that were the sacrificers, the moralists, the conservers, the workers, the survivors that should get the credit."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is pretty ilustrative of the deeds of the generation that went to World War II and it is a very worth reading in order to understand some of the motives and views of the 'greatest generation'."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Being an 80 year old, WWII B25 pilot, and kid from the citrus orchards of Whittier, Calif. I recognized many of my Air Force, college, and business friends in this book, though the names are different. Tom Brokaw, did indeed, find the &quot;innerds&quot; of these people he describes, and has truly captured the essence of their reason for existence. A successful and appreciated presentation. Thank you, Tom Brokaw"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Outstanding work; vignettes of individuals &amp; their contributions. A rightfully proud generation. The reader/reviewer that suggests Brokaw wrote this from an ultra-leftwing view is way off the mark. This is written in a spirit of patriotism, love of his country and giving the WW2 generation their due. Thanks, Mr. Brokaw, for a fine job."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My Dad jumped on D Day, 82nd Airborne(Devils in Baggy Pants}was wounded before he landed and spent the next few mos as a POW.As in Mr.Browkaws book these men never really talked about their total experience but I could sense it remained with him the rest of his life.Id like to thank Mr.Browkaw for reminding the rest of us what a true hero really is."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I've read countless books and seen all the great movies about WWII. Both of my parents served in the American Army during the War. My father was a teacher turned Sergeant in a Medical unit. He landed on Omaha beach on D-Day. My mother was a nurse who served as a Captain in the Paris Hospital as the war in Europe came to an end. Tom Brokaw has given me a view that I hadn't seen before. I now have a greater understanding of what my parents sacrificed. The book truly tells the rest of us what my parents could not. Through all the movies and documentaries, my parents seldom spoke of their trial and tribulations. I now understand a little more the reason why. I just wish the book would have been written prior to my father's death. I would have had so much to talk to him about, or at least appreciate more."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My cryptic summary is trying to condense the fact that the individual stories are very interesting, put together they all start to run together into sameness. The indivudal accomplishments throughout the book as well as what this generation accomplished is undeniably fantastic. However, Brokaw's book ramrods this home with such volume that I simply couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to like this book, but I'll take Ambrose's D-Day book anyday."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book should be required reading for every high school history class. The sacrifices of those who fought in WWII should NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. Several chapters will give you a lump in the throat, if not tears in your eyes. However on page 139, Mr. Brokaw refers to General George S. Patton's IVORY HANDLED pistols as Pearl Handled. General Patton corrected a journalist on this subject by saying &quot;Only a pimp in a New Orleans whorehouse would have a pearl handled pistol.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is about the lives of World War II Veterans. I can see why so many people like it. This book does a very good job of giving details. The details make the book feel very personal. They allow you to really get to know the people that the stories are about. Unfortunately, it is the details that make the book seem boring. I would have liked it better if the details were focused on the action and not on trivial issues. Maybe, some day, when I am an old man (when I'm 26 or so), I will re-read this and get more enjoyment out of it. I did find several stories to be rather interesting. I enjoyed reading about the way African American veterans were treated. Another problem I had with the book is that Tom Brokaw is a little to conservative for me. Everybody, except the guy who makes the \\"Mallard Fillmore\\" comic strip, knows liberals are more fun. (..)"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Enjoyed this book, although the stories all have a familiar ring and lose their punch a bit. Compelling, overall. For a different perspective, I recommend Jack Nadel's book &quot;My Enemy, My Friend.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's book was interesting because it gave a variety of view points and stories. The book was well written except for when Brokaw tried to tell the stories of two or more people in one chapter. It became a little confusing because you had to keep track of who's who. Other than that The Greatest Generation is a very good book. It tell stories of love, honor, and dedication and it gives the reader a feeling of pride in our country. I recommend this book to everyone and am looking forward to read the follow up book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was deeply moved by the stories in this book. These people are like those I grew up with: my teachers, the policemen, the farmers, my pastor. What they experienced was left unspoken, what they sacrificed was known only to them. This book records some of their stories and reveals the heart of our country's soul in the process. They are not to be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I really don't like Tom Brokaw, the NBC News Anchorman. Although I have watched his career for more than 30 years, and recognized early on that he was going to one day occupy the top seat of his profession, I never really liked him. I remember hearing bits and pieces of his character and personal life over the years. Only two things are remembered of him at the moment; he likes the outdoors, and he is from South Dakota. Two things he has going for him. But I really don't like him.I was sent a package last Christmas. One I had been looking forward to receiving. Lots of good stuff in the package, and an unexpected item. In the bottom of the package was a book; \\"The Greatest Generation\\", and yes, you guessed it; Tom Brokaw wrote it. At least it was a first edition. Oddly enough, I had heard about this book. Some even said it was a pretty good read. That it paid tribute to a generation and a people that largely go about their business without accolades. Only now is their work being recognized. Only now are the sacrifices they made coming to the full realization of the generations that have come after them. So I decided to give Tom Brokaw a chance to impress me. Haltingly, I admit that I was somewhat impressed. By presenting this book to the public, Tom Brokaw has accomplished something of far greater value than to impress me, or anyone else, for that matter. What he did do was trigger the mechanisms that start us on the path of pondering. I have to give him that, even though I don't really like him.When I was finished with \\"The Greatest Generation\\", I put the book down and just stared at the air for a time. Slowly and ever so surely, thoughts of people exactly like those he wrote about in his book began to flow through my consciousness. A smile came to my face. Memories of the sweetest sort broadened the smile. And even though I was smiling, sometimes the smile was a sad one. Many of those helping to create the memories now flowing through me were gone. Dead. Their voices never to be heard again; their firm handshake never to be felt again; the probing look of their eyes, gone forever. No longer am I able to smell the rich smells of grandma's kitchen. Nor hear the big belly laugh of my grandfather. I am very pleased Tom Brokaw reminded me of their contributions, even though I don't like him very much.\\"The Greatest Generation\\" is an easy book to read. It oft-times fills you with pride when acknowledging the deeds and sacrifices of others. Of those that came before us. They did what they did because of a solid value system. A universal belief that right, equals might and will, no matter what it takes, be the victor, claiming the right to hoist the flag of human dignity, up the petard.I don't have to like Tom Brokaw to thank him for causing me to ponder."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"After reading many of the book reviews in this listing, I feel compelled to bring my words of appreciation to Mr Brokaw. Currently serving in the US Air Force, with over 22 years' in service, I can understand the author's need to give thanks to those who offered their lives so willingly for our great country. This is a good book - and a great read for today's boomers and generation Xs. It was not meant to be a detailed text of the war itself - for that, readers should look toward established historical tomes. I salute the &quot;greatest generation&quot; and only hope we can prove ourselves worthy of their many sacrifices. Thanks, sir - and I hope you're considering something along the lines of a millenium review!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"They may very well be the &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; but this well meaning book fails to give much insight into why.The book consists of a series of thumbnail sketches of individuals who served or lived through the period of the Second World War. Each story goes like this: The person male or female grew up on a farm or in the city and suffered poverty in the Depression, but they did not think of themselves as poor because they had family. Then the war broke out and they enlisted, went to work in the factory, hospital, laundry. They were happy to get the work, because the hadn't had much work during the Depression, and if they fought and killed and were heroes who got medals they were and are just &quot;awshucks&quot; about it now. They got out of the Army, Navy, Aircorp, factory, married their highschool sweetheart, went to school on the GI bill, worked real hard, had a couple of kids, instilled values in the kids (even if the kids ended up smoking pot and protesting the war in Vietnam), and now they're pretty old and underappreciated until now. Now their grandkids saw &quot;Private Ryan&quot; and say gee Grandpa you're really a hero, and you too Grandma for writing him all those nice letters and not running off with Jody during the war. Grandma and Grandpa didn't get a divorce, they're still together and still the nice fella/gal they married, and doing community service 'cause that's the way they were brought up.That generation did save the world from the most vicious dictators the world has seen. They were heroes and they deserve recognition, but this book falls far short of presenting any real insight or thoughtfulness. Read D-Day, Citizen Soldier, The Great Escape, Before Their Time or fiction The Naked &amp; the Dead, anything about WWII by James Jones (Here to Eternity, Thin Red Line). There's plenty of good stuff, this just isn't it. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A great collection of biographies. I was completely thrilled reading each story about a member of the Greatest Generation. This book portrays the various traits that the people who made America great possessed. There has never again been a generation as great."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I think Tom Brokaw should be applauded for writing this book. A lot of reviewers have commented the contents, which I will not say much.This is not a book that I can read in one-shot as it is a collate of several stories. Some people have complained about the book for lacking in substance. But, I think the beauty of the book is the \\"awareness\\" or appreciation created by these short stories. If people are intersted WWII history, they can always consult their history text books or some of non-fiction books devoted exclusively on the topics. I think the theme of this book is very different from those \\"well-researched\\" book. And, I think it will probably reach a wider audience as the book is an easy reading without some details that you will probably not remember after reading them.So, I will say, for someone who look for poetic writing, go to Shakespear. If someone look for exact facts/figures in WWII, go to their history text book. For those, who want to have a picture what the previous generation, it's a nice starting point."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Highly recommend this book.

They won a war, we stopped an unjust one. They lynched black people, we died with them to help win them the right to vote. Yes winning WWII was great, what have you done for me lately?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. It's incredibly motivational, uplifting, and emotional. It makes me think a lot about my grandparents, their friends, and all the stories they used to share about their lives during World War II and after. I believe Mr. Brokaw is right in calling them our \\"greatest generation.\\" They overcame a lot and when the war ended, they started families, businesses, went to college, and really did some wonderful things for this country. A far cry from the whining, selfish, materialistic, spoiled group of kids on the earth now. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, thousands and thousands of American men signed up to defend this country. Good luck seeing that happen again.The only thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars is Tom Brokaw's inability to leave politics out of it. There are many jabs at Republicans all throughout this book. So much Nixon bashing, you'd wonder what you're reading. Brokaw tells of a friend of his calling Nixon's administration \\"the gestapo\\" in a chapter that is supposed to tell the story of veteran Chesterfield Smith. Later, in a chapter on Bob Dole, he relates how once Dole referred to Nixon as \\"evil.\\" In the chapter on Mark Hatfield and others, the GOP is referenced with words like \\"agenda,\\" \\"litmus test,\\" and others. Bob Dole is the only person in the book that is spoken of as having multiple sides, and is the only person in the book where examples of his negative traits are given. Where is all this coming from?I loved the stories in this book. It really opened my eyes to a lot, made me think, and motivated me to do more with my life. If only Mr. Brokaw could have left his politics out of it, this really could have been something. Shame."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I received the book as a gift, but did not get into it until months later. What a pleasant surprise. The book brought me in close and personal to those who sacrificed so much to give us the things we take for granted today. We had been given a country, that is a gem above all others in freedom and opportunity to become the best we can be, by those who put their lives on the line. Brokaw has given us the ability to put a name and a face to some of those deeds. Today, we as a nation are losing our sense of morality, our respect for human life and fair play, and our nationalistic pride, the very things that had made us as great as we are. In reading this book, I have a renewed respect for those who served, and a renewed pride in what I am and the nation I am part of. My thanks to Brokaw for helping me remember, but more importantly, my most sincere gratitude to those who put love of country and it's principles above their own safety."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I'm a teenage girl, but I've always been interested in history. I feel that The Greatest Generation is appropriately titled - I've always had a strong admiration for the WW2 generation, which includes both sets of my grandparents. I was actually looking forward to reading this book, and I knew I was going to have to stay involved, with 400+ pages to read.What I found was a good, easy to read format, with a strong, straightforward narrative. Brokaw takes the facts from each person's lives and, for the most part, manages to craft a story worth reading. At times, I was eagerly devouring the pages; but at others, it was so dreary that I just plain skipped it. And by page 300, I was really wondering if I wanted to finish it.I did, however, and I'm glad; Brokaw paints a warm, beautiful picture of America from the 1940s through today, with a strong emphasis on the baby boom. Sometimes he gets bogged down in the facts, as any reporter-turned-writer might, and that's what takes this down to a 4-star book. That's also why I had a hard time reading parts of it. However, anyone who experienced this period in history will certainly enjoy The Greatest Generation.Bottom Line: Reccommended - especially for those who wish to learn more about the 'personal' side of WW2. For anyone over 65, this is a must read. Brokaw's book gives us a valuable archive which will be doubly appreciated 100 years from now."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Right from the start, I must confess that before reading this book, the only redeeming feature I could ever see in Brokaw was that he was far better that \\"The Dan,\\" i.e. Dan Rather. After reading this work though, my opinion changed some what. I enjoyed ever word. This is a wonderful collection of stories and accounts taken during the time of WWII. It is taken from those that were there. This is a valuable contribution to our oral history and I am glad that Mr. Brokaw too the time and had the sensitivity to do it. I wish there were more works like this around. These folks of the greatest generation are quickly dying off and we are loosing so much history and knowledge. After reading a couple of the other reviews of this book, all I can say is thank God I have not become so jaded and \\"sophisticated\\" that I do not get a chill and become a bit moisted eyed at the accompishments of truely great Americans. Thank you Mr. Brokaw for at least this."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"&quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; was inspiring. As a young adult I have yet to experience anything having to do with the war. The horror stories to me are exactly that, just stories. While reading this book I was taken aback.

It is unusual and sad to see the differences between &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, and the generation today. The stories in this book are ones of hope, love, courage, bravery, and overcoming adversity. They are happy, sad, and inspiring. I enjoyed reading about those people that everyone has known or heard of, all the way to those people who go unheard and unspoken of. Tom Brokaw did a wonderful job capturing all aspects of World War II from the men in the middle of the battle, to the women fighting their own battles at home.

As a granddaughter of a WWII vet, I now look at my grandpa in a new light. Brokaw honestly tells the stories of average men and women that fought for our country in WWII. Everyone had different experiences but they all shared the same traits about caring more about others then themselves. I loved the stories about the heroes fighting for our country, but I was also impressed with the many women that also helped defend the country. My grandpa has never said much about the war, until recently. He is beginning to open up and many other vets are sharing their stories as well. Brokaw's novel was so direct yet unexpected with all the thoughts and feelings with all the vets. I love hearing about how these men protected our country and never second guessed why they were fighting the war. I believe, like Tom Brokaw, they are a great generation but I believe that there will be many more \\"Great Generations\\" to come. Another group of people will be put to the test and they will also show their colors. For now though, these men and women are truly the greatest generation that the US has produced. I only wish that we all had more time to learn from these individuals."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw is a compelling novel with great significance to the men and women serving our country during World War Two. These brave men and women suffered through the Great Depression and yet somehow brought with them enough courage to give us the world we are living in today. In their hearts they knew what needed to be done and not a single soul held back from it. When reading the Greatest Generation you will come across people of different races, religion, and different societies. You will relive with famous people, ordinary people, and heroes that put their lives on the line during that time era. These American citizens were trained through their hearts day after day only to come across one of the worst battles history has ever known.You will men such as Lloyd Kilmer, an aviation cadet, who was assigned to the 448 Bomb group. Or you will meet a man by the name of Gorden Larsen who would spend most of his life trying to put the war behind him and forget it. Women also played a major role in combat. One woman, Margaret Roy Ringenberg, was part of the WASP's and excelled in military aircraft. She gave flying lessons to others who admitted she was a far better trainer than any other instructor they had learned from.When serving in World War Two the famous George Bush learned a lot about life. He was curiously inarticulate about the defining moments of the war. He considers his years as a navy combat flyer an extremely important part of his life's experiences. These people mentioned are only a few talked about in this book of remembrance, achievement, honor, and courage.I enjoyed this book very much. I learned much detail about the war that I had never knew existed before this novel. These brave men and women have achieved so much in their life and I loved learning about each and every one of them. I look up to them for their accomplishments and have learned that the generation of World War Two was unlike any other."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"What I Liked best about this book is how it is all personal accounts. The book is not just about the people who were doing the fighting, but also about the Woman on the homefront who built our bombers, Fighters, Tanks and more. About one of the men who was a designer of the b-29.He also talks about some of the people who fought in the war to later become famous. People like George McGovern, a B-24 pilot in the 15th who later became a polition. George Bush who flew an evenger over the pacific, and how he was shot down and survived over the pacific. Andy Rooney, who became a popular journalist after the war. There are many more. If anyone is intrested in learning, almost by a storytelling aspect, than this book is for you.Some might compare the way he writes to Ambrose because of the interviews. This book is a lightyear away in the way he writes it. Ambrose books follow one battle. This follows just one person in a chapter through some of the important parts of their wartime expierience. ( each chapter is about 2-3 pages long.) So i would suggest this book to anyone intrested in World War Two, it is a great testament to all the people who were involved in the winning of World War Two."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was born in 1957, only 12 years after WW2 ended. My father and all three of his brothers fought in the war. And fortunately, all four of them made it home alive. My father-in-law also fought as a front-line machine gunner in Europe.My father never wanted to talk about the war. Although he was an officer on Gen. George Patton's staff, he was mum on what he experienced. I realize now what he experienced was too painful. With that, I am grateful for the stories in this book. I think anyone born after WW2 should read this book simply to appreciate what the American people and troops had to go through. My heart goes out to those parents who lost their sons and the girlfriends who lost their loves. So many lives were profoundly changed.This book should be manditory reading for high school students in any American History class. And they should also show Steven Spielberg's movie, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" to make young people appreciate the freedoms that were fought for in Europe and the Pacific. If Nazi's and Japanese Empire had defeated the Allies, I guarantee you this would have been a different world. Had we lost there's a very good chance many of us walking the Earth would not be here right now.Bravo to you Tom Brokaw! Thank you for sharing so much of your hard work in the research of this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A set of wonderful stories about REAL people that rose to the challange of Nazi Germany and with our allies eventually defeated that threat.I do have one small observation. All my life people of my grandparents generation \\"The Greatest Generation\\" have been telling that if there was ever another crisis like World War 2 we couldn't handle it. Well we did a preety good job after September 11th didn't we?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"If you are from the baby boomer generation, you can truly understand what made your parents, aunts, and uncles of this generation who they were. Since the events of September 11th and after reading this book, I have a finer appreciation of what heroes are truly made of. I have a better insight into who my parents were and why. I also understand why I am the way I am and what these qualities that were passed down, did for me in my life. It also makes you appreciate the cost of freedom and what the men and women of the military did and continue to do to protect our liberties. Something I think we took for granted before September 11th. Enlightening book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"On the chapter about Lloyd Kilmer, there is a picture titled &quot;Liberation Day&quot;. The photo was dated April 29, 1945.

IF you read the introduction, he essentially thanks everybody who found all the various stories for his book. The book is nothing more than a collection of compiled stories with Tom Brokaw's name on the book jacket. Hey Tom, write your own stories!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Wonderful collection of stories about our WWII heros with nice commentary from the NBC newsman. Women and minorities are dutifully included, with the exception of the homosexual community. Tom's researchers could've dug a wee bit deeper.

In short, I found this book to be too shallow and &quot;bland.&quot; Just lost my interest. This is the first book I have ever given up on. I feel a great shame in not finishing but I just can't subject myself to it no longer! I thought it would be moving and inspiring, instead it was &quot;blah.&quot; With regards, Max"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Half of this book is just Tom reading events from a high school history book. I expected the book to contain 90% letters but was disappointed half of the book contained this unwanted history review. It seems Tom is just trying to capitalize on the generation's tragedy. His reading of the factual events adds almost nothing to the understanding of the letters."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's &quot;greatest generation&quot; thesis is dubious and presumptuous. Some facts: In the years leading up to WWII, the US was fiecely isolationist. The &quot;greatest generation&quot; was not interseted in defeating fascism/nazism/totalitarianism until Pearl Harbor-- despite the fact that the war had been raging for more than 2 years in Europe. (There is mounting evidence that FDR orchestrated the Pearl Harbor debacle in order to rally a disinterested and apathetic public to the cause of war. FDR's next step was to violate the civil rights of Japanese-American citizens, intern them in &quot;relocation&quot; camps, and then have the arrogance to draft them into the war!) Whether we want to admit it or not, US military involvment in Europe was essentially a mopping up of a crumbling alliance of Fascist/Nazi troops whose best and brightest had perished at the hands of the relentless Soviet juggernaut. While US troops had to deal with Hitler's last offensive in the Battle of the Bulge, they were spared the mega-blitzkrieg assaults of Moscow, Stalingrad, and Kursk (the largest tank battle in history), in which the Soviets stood up to Hitler single handed, and defeated the dictator to win back their country (Soviet casualties in WWII are estimated to be 20 MILLION). One of the primary reasons that US-Soviet relations turned cold after the war was Stalin's justified belief that the US dragged its feet in opening a second front. The next gesture of arrogance and cruelty of this &quot;greatest generation&quot; was the decision to drop not one but two atomic bombs on mainland Japan, ostensibly to end the war, but in reality to demonstrate our military superiority to the Soviets-- a rather macabre and cynical gesture to our then-ally. Following the war, the &quot;greatest generation&quot; came back home and raised a &quot;lesser&quot; generation of kids who recognized the hypocrisy and shallowness of their parents' attitudes (racism, conformity, hyper-patriotism) and deeds (McCarthyism, Korea, Vietnam, and ultimately Watergate). Some more facts: I am neither Democrat nor Republican. I have sincere respect and admiration for the US soldiers who sacrificed in ALL wars, not just WWII. Those who fought in WWII deserve praise. However, ALL generations of Americans have contributed to the fabric of the United States and deserve praise as well. Why do we need to define who was &quot;the greatest&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book has so much to offer. For the younger generation, it offers us a glimpse of something we've been told about, but can't truly grasp.World War II brought out the best in our nation. We came together under a common cause and were more united than ever. The young men and women of that generation, my age now and younger, were The Greatest Generation without a doubt.These amazing people have shared their stories with Mr. Brokaw, and it is just incredible to learn about the personal contributions that people made for the sake of our country.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater appreciation for the sacrifices of previous generations. This book will move you, and you will wholeheartedly have a new appreciation for these people."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is mainly about Brokaw's love for Republican politicians who served in World War Two, and little else. The average GI doesn't seem to matter here. There are some interesting parts, such as how black veterans were treated, but all in all, this book fails miserably."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am shocked that anyone could find this book &quot;tedious and condescending.&quot; I must vehemently disagree with the reviewer who states that The Greatest Generation &quot;minimizes every other generation of people.&quot; It does no such thing; it is a moving tribute to a generation that deserves such a tribute. If it weren't for the struggles and heroism of that generation, we might not be here today. The reviewer I refer to writes, &quot;if Mr. Brokaw and others think that my generation hasn't faced death, despair, fear, illness and poverty, he and they are not truly connected to the world in which they live now.&quot; To this reviewer, I must say that the current generations of Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers do NOT face such struggle on the same massive level as those who lived (or died) during the Depression and the World Wars. Today's &quot;myriad of stresses that cloud everyday life&quot; cannot be compared to the stresses endured by what Brokaw rightly calls the &quot;Great Generation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book was excellent. It is very important to get several points of view on a certain topic. I always enjoy studying this topic. What can be more gratifying than hearing the stories of those who were there? And by the way, danno, if you're gonna' say &quot;God&quot; CAPITALIZE IT!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My parents are from South Dakota. They are Oglala Lakota (Sioux). My father was in the Army from 7-43 to 9-45 ( Tank driver/2nd Arm'd 5-44 to 3-45). My mother was in the Navy from 4-44 to 6-45. Every story I saw my parents. I saw their brothers, I saw their cousins. Tom Brokaw even quoted my Mothers brother on pg. 208. Moot (Cleveland) Nelson. I had many tears while reading the stories, but more when I read of my Uncle Moot and his short commentary. Tom called that chapter &quot;Shame&quot;' and rightfully so. Yes. Tom could have gone deeper, but the subject matter itself prevents that,he could of got lost real easy, and that was not the overall purpose of the book. But I do not feel he &quot;Short Sticked&quot; anyone on any of his stories,as some of the other reviewers stated. My only correction would be for Tom to correct his statement about certain Japanese Americans being sent to an Indian reservation southwest of Phoenix.. This is the Papago/Pima Reservation, not the Navajo Reservation. ( Pg. 220.) Other than that, Tom's book should be placed in many of our schools, both Grade school level as well as High school. There is a lesson in who we are today within those pages. A lesson that should be repeated for all of us &quot;Boomers&quot; and our children .We do not know how lucky we are for the things we have today, but with Tom's book on the shelf we can be reminded of those who made it very possible for the way we live and the liberties we have today. This book ranks right up there wirh all of Stephen Ambrose's latest works, as well Stud Terkels, and any other essays on the WWII/Depression period . The book is easy to read, informative , but not redundant, and touching , but not relying on any overt patriotic feelings that we now have for that period in our history. Job, Well Done !!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Yeah, I'm impressed with everything that those veterans did in the years following the war, but Brokaw seems to focus only (or mostly) on those that became politicians or in government. What about the effects of the war on musicians? or artists? I would have liked to see him expand on his stories more. All in all, I felt obligated to finish the book (my mother raved about it, but then, she is one of &quot;those generation&quot;) but I wouldn't recommend it or read it again."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Noble try. Right instincts. There must surely be more interesting stories? Little energy, though the intention is touching.

The track record has been out there for 50 years!!Can you imagine my generation of babyboomers making the same sacrifice? Even the standing in line for a loaf of bread? No you cannot and the questiom is why not? The fundamental answer to that is that the &quot; Greatest Generation&quot; did not have the courage to pass their legacy on to their children. They denied us nothing and as a result you have the America you have today. The short term years ahead are going to see the greatest transfer of wealth from one generation to another in recorded history, and the baby boomers truly believe they deserve it.The greatest genration were far from rich, however, they were a lot happier and content then we will ever be. Our children will be even less so!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Perhaps the quintessential shortcoming of any generation is the inability to comprehend the one that came before them. The WWII generation, born in the &quot;roaring twenties&quot; and seasoned by the great depression, left the farm where they plowed the north 40 with a mule and harness and came home to an atomic age. Their children had no comprehension of the vast difference between the the way the world was before 1940 and what it had become by 1945. Whether or not they were the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; will be determined only by the perspective of future generations; but they were certainly a &quot;great generation&quot; and Brokaw's book goes a long way in helping my generation understand our parents. There are better historical analyses of the WW II era than this but none convey the depth of feeling and motivation available here. Thanks Tom &amp; Thanks Mom &amp; Dad!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The recent attention given to the men and women who came of age during World War II is long overdue. To paraphrase Churchill, never have so many owed so much to so few. But as a member of the current generation, I flinched at the jabs that members of our &quot;greatest generation&quot; and Mr. Brokaw inflicted on my &quot;class.&quot; That is not to say I don't understand their frustrations with us and the country they now find themselves in. But too often, Brokaw slipped into lecture about the good old days. Every generation is different and shaped by the events around it. His greatest generation emerged from below deck of the USS America to be shoved overboard into the turbulent seas of depression and war. They had no choice or time to prepare. To their credit, they not only survived, but thrived. As my generation emerges from below deck, we aren't being pushed overboard. Rather, we've discovered that no one is sailing the ship. There's no compass or map, and no one to show us what to do. We're learning to sail ouselves. We're learning how to avoid the pratfalls that even the &quot;greatest generation&quot; encountered in Vietnam and Watergate. We're discovering that the United States hasn't always been the &quot;good guy.&quot; We're learning to think for ourselves We're trying to do the right thing, for ouselves, for our families and for our country."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a boomer and an &quot;estranged from his parent's 60's rebel&quot; this audiobook helped me to get in touch with feelings for my parents that were long missing.

Will any generation have the guts and selflessness ever again that this one had?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Grateful to read in print actual accounts of Veterans. There should be more personal accounts documented from personal interviews. Young people need to learn of these personal, true experiences.

I was truly inspired by the stories of how ordinary people rose to the occassion at a time of great need for our country and our world and prayed that our current generation would have the courage and fortitude to do the same. However, the writing style of Brokaw left much to be desired. His passages too often read like the overly earnest writings of a young English Lit major. However whenever the book returns to the actual words and recollections of the veterans, my spirits soared. Definitely worth reading for the example this generation put forth for all of us to follow."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation Tom BrokawISBN 0-385-33462-12001Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is a collection of short biographies of people who were young adults at the outbreak of World War II. Some of the people that Brokaw writes about are well known, such as George Bush, Andy Rooney, Bob Dole, Art Buchwald, Daniel Inouye, and Julia Childs. Others are ordinary folks.Brokaw began to hear the stories that went into this book when he went to France to do a television program on the fiftieth anniversary of D-day in 1984. The stories reminded him of his boyhood experiences on a South Dakota army post during the war. Writing this book was something of a sentimental experience for Mr. Brokaw. One is charmed by incidents such as the time when the young Brokaw needed a lawnmower to make money, and his father built him one from salvaged parts, including ones from an old washing machine.Brokaw observes in these stories that most Americans of that time were from rural backgrounds, extremely self-reliant, and largely honorable people, who tried to do what they saw as the right thing. They had grown up during the depression with little, and they expected little. When called upon to make sacrifices during the war they did so at an enormous cost to themselves and their families, and they did so in a remarkably selfless manner. The values that these people held are not widely-held values today, and thus it is interesting to look back at these men and women, in a book such as this, to understand who they were and how they came to be.As an example of self-reliance, Brokaw writes about a man who grew up in the poverty of the dust bowl and got a job at Boeing Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. At the plant men worked twelve to fourteen hours a day, but the farm boys they hired were accustomed to long hours. On the farm, he had taken tractors apart and put them back together and gotten up at 4:00 in the morning to milk the cows. In the aircraft factory, when desired materials could not be found, he and the other toolmakers improvised by making tools out of Masonite or Maplewood. They had an instinct for creativity and inventiveness.Women pitched in during the war and contributed in new ways. A woman from Indiana was one of the 25,000 who volunteered for the Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASPS). She too was raised on a farm. She started taking flying lessons in 1940, and got a license just in time to join the war effort. She spent six months of training in various airplanes in Sweetwater, Texas. In Wilmington, Delaware, she was assigned to testing and transporting planes used to train men as combat pilots. Other women towed targets for anti-aircraft and airborne target practice. Sometimes they returned home withbullet holes in their planes.There was a great sense of community in the United State during the war years. In the Kerry Corner neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, many in the Irish, working-class neighborhood signed up for the armed forces. Someone put up a banner with a star for every young man who had enlisted or was drafted. Mothers and fathers gathered on the square to get together Christmas packages for the boys.Although I found this book to be worthwhile reading, I also found a few shortcomings. First, the selection of stories is tipped too much in favor of the well known. One suspects that these are people that Brokaw has met as a person of influence, rather than individuals who represent the greater masses.Second, Tom Brokaw is a professional reporter, but not a professional writer. I did not feel that he added much insight beyond telling the stories of some of the men and women who served in the war, somewhat the way Studs Terkel did by transcribing the interviews for his book, \\"Working\\".Last, the notion of the title, \\"The Greatest Generation\\" is an exaggeration that serves no good purpose. One wonders what other generations were researched and considered for this particular honor. Clearly, the answer is likely none. Perhaps, \\"A Greater Generation\\" would have been a better and more accurate description of what Mr. Brokaw wrote about. On the whole though, Brokaw's book does give appropriate attention to a generation that one may find more admirable than some that have followed. His achievement is in reminding us of the days when most Americans were less affluent, less materialistic, and less self-serving."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is a valiant attempt to cover a fairly broad theme. While the overall product is certainly worth the commitment of time, be warned that it often fails to maintain its continuity and I sometimes found Mr. Brokaw's style a little too much to take. As an earlier reviewer noted this book, and the related products,appear to be Brokaw's attempt to find a platform from which to launch a future political career, ( plenty of voters left from the &quot;greatest Generation&quot;) The book's style is to provide a variety of personal stories, tethered together with Brokaw's prose. There is a lot of strong material but there were also a lot redundant, and frankly irrelevant pieces. Nonetheless there is still a lot in this book. This was a vital period in this country's growth and Brokaw has done a decent job in trying to give us all a sense of what life was like in America during that time. This is definitely one I will encourage my 15 year old daughter to read.."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The recent attention WWII has received, through new novels like &quot;War of the Rats&quot; OR movies like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; have made me grateful that those of us who answered the call in 1941 haven't been forgotten. I am not an admirer of Tom Brokaw, but I read &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; with a growing sense of respect for the man. He has a political bias I can't abide but in lending his time and name to a book such as this he has won a grudging degree of respect from me. This is a good book, well worth reading, especially for those younger people who think the 1980's was a long time ago. If it weren't for the 500,000 Americans who died to preserve freedom in WWII we would all be in sorry shape indeed."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"We all know Tom Brokaw to be a second-rate, fear-peddling, shallow and unoriginal broadcaster. With this book, Brokaw manages to transplant all of these attributes to writing. As if poor and occasionally self-conciously florid writing did not make this book poor enough, Brokaw, as any mass-media ninny would do, focuses on truly trivial aspects of World War II, e.g., the experiences of &quot;victims&quot; -- women, etc. In the process, he completely eschews any meaningful tribute to what WWII was fought for, what any serious treatment of the subject would not leave out. The result is a thoroughly banal presentation of the most heroic and momentous event of the twentieth century. But, this is what I should have expected from a television newscaster. Churchill's &quot;The Second World War&quot; is still (by far) the best history of WWII, personal or otherwise. Is it any coincidence that WWII's greatest hero was also its greatest historian?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Sure, this generation won a war, but what was the alternative?In my opinion, all this generation did was run up the world's greatest debt...then leave it to their kids to pay the tab.When they didn't have a war to send their children to, they created one in Vietnam. After killing over 50,000 of us, they decided maybe it wasn't such a good idea afterall.When they decided they didn't want to pay for their own medical bills, they created Medicare. And guess who pays? They underfunded their retirement. And guess who pays? They built a highway system. And guess who pays? They poluted the environment like never before. Guess who pays to clean it up the mess.I do agree with Brokaw on one point, this is one generation that was the greatest at one thing...avoiding responsibility."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Let me begin by saying I teach history and I have always enjoyed oral histories. They fascinate me. My favorite part of history is World War 2. But all I have read before is the military history not the social history.Well this book really delivers in that Tom Brokaw way of reporting. He covers all types of people of that generation and the stories they have to tell are pretty amazing.These were simple people that expected nothing. They had to grow up in a hurry and handle responsibilities beyond their years.One theme in the book is if the next Generation can handle the challenge. Specifically the Generation X people. It is ironic that now this generation is dealing with its own Pearl Harbor and now its own war.I recommned highly everyone to read this book to have an understanding of the older generation of this country. We owe these people a lot."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am a veteran of The Big One. I served five-and-one-half years on active duty. Until I read Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation, however, I was never particularly proud of my contribution to the war effort, and had no heroic tales to tell my children or my bar mates. In all that time, I never fired a shot in anger. As an Instructor Bombardier, I spent perhaps a thousand hours aloft in a B-24. I did not even leave the United States, except for a six-week aerial gunnery school in Laredo, Texas, during which I ventured into Mexico on a weekend pass. In addition, I faced embarrassment when bombardiers I had trained returned to Boise, Idaho's Gowen Field after their 25 missions over Germany and saw me still safely ensconced in the States.Thanks to Brokaw, however, I have a new perspective on my service years. On my 85th birthday The Greatest Generation actually made me feel proud of serving my country in the Air Force, (known at the start of my military career as the Army Air Corps.) Brokaw's work is a non-fiction account of how my generation came of age during the Second World War, went on to build modern America, and give us the world we have today.The book devotes separate chapters to accounts of individuals in actual combat situations, including one chapter about soon-to-be-President George Bush. There are also accounts of non-combatants and their contribution to the war effort. All of us were united by a common purpose and, Brokaw says, by common values: duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country and, above all, responsibility for oneself. Hollywood's recent 'Saving Private Ryan' and HBO's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; graphically depicts those values. Who could not be proud, given that perspective? So we non-combatants can be proud of, not embarrassed about, our roles in those parlous times. As the poet John Milton said centuries ago, they also serve who only stand and wait.Scores of reviews of The Greatest Generation have been written by persons not of the greatest generation but so many of these are negative reviews. How dare they!!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I read Brokaw's sequel: &quot;The Greatest Generation Speaks&quot; before reading this one, and that second book is far the better one. Those stories, submitted directly by readers in response to &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;, are more compelling and inspiring than those of this original, since they rely on the contributors' own letters rather than Brokaw's &quot;interviews&quot;. And &quot;Speaks&quot; successfully avoids the tedious repetition, political shading and denigration of the boomer generation that flaws this work. Read the sequel first, then tackle this one only if you must have more."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw is not a professional writer, which is sometimes obvious in his book, but in &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; he serves his main purpose in the undertaking. Browkaw honors everybody in the WWII generation, from soldiers who fought on the front lines to wives that were left behind to keep things smooth on the homefront, and shows the respect that they earned through the sacrifices they made throughout the 1940s.This book clearly depicts the events that many of the survivors of this generation lived through and details the types of things they were forced to give up for the good of the country. It showed me how lucky we were to have a generation of people that were willing to band together as they did and that without them, our country would not be as it is today. The now 70 year olds that lived through the second World War have done as much, if not more, than ANYBODY in the nation's history. Thanks to Brokaw, their stories are now known to the public and will no live on forever.I recommend this book to all Americans. It lets you know what the nation has gone through and what that generation tolerated. Reading the short stories in the book makes me feel proud to be an American and thankful for those that I read of."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is a must read for the generations that followed. The stories show us that we are responsable for our own action and no one else. Here was a generation that came from nothing, fought a horrible war and came home to make our country what it is today. They really were the Greatest Generation. I feel that this book is so inspiring that it should be on every students reading list."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It seems many people have this book confused as a testimony ofWorld War II, but I challenge you to re-think your stance. The titlecan be no clearer: The Greatest Generation. Yes, there are the stories of the men who fought in WWII, but what of the women back home, the wives, the children, the neighbors, the relatives.This is a great book in understanding the moral up-bringing and pride and sense of responsibility that was prominent back in the 40's and 50's but has seemed to disapear with the current generation. Our generation will be remembered as the one who blamed everybody but themselves for personal problems and making frivoulos lawsuits.These were people who came out of a depression just to go into a war, and for those that came back, to turn there lives around. Not just for themselves, but for their families, and for ours today. They didin't know the word defeat, and made sure there families were a priority (can we say that about ourselves today?)This book took people from all walks of life and painted a very realistic picture of what patriotic pride is all about. They weren't seeking glory or money, but had a deeper meaning of fullfilling a wanting in their hearts to help their fellow American.Some of the individual account can be a bit tedious at times, but there are many other stories of what true hero's are/were and that doesn't mean you had to be holding a rifle. There were plety of unsung hero's back here at home.With myself just turning 30, I am convinced that those Americans (of all backgrounds) of the 40's and 50's truly were the Greatest Generation. They were the generation that ensured we would have our own generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is a justifiably fine and respectful tribute to many of the men who fought and won the war against the Fascists. It would be foolish not to recognize their heroism. But in many ways, the book is also a backhand insult to the other heroes of WW-II. As a Black American, who had both a father, a stepfather and uncles -- among other family members -- who fought, and either died or came back from WW-II and the Korean War, wounded -- including serious psychological injuries -- nothing was more damaging to them than the fact that they had to go to war in a segregated army to fight Hitler's own brand of segregation and racism. These men were neither fools nor dumb brutes; obviously to a man they believed more in the cherished principles of this nation than did their white counterparts with whom they fought along side in the foxholes.And here I mean no disrespect to anyone, but must add that with rare exception, the stories the veterans in my family told were not of German or Japanese atrocities, but of the atrocities committed against them by their own white \\"band of brothers\\" in arms. These were gratuitous, hate-filled, visceral, raw injuries and insults directed against those who fought beside them in the same foxholes - and they did so only because they were black. These too must be counted among Brokaw's Greatest Generation.And although Brokaw mentions, in passing (and as if it were an obligatory aside), Japanese internment and the Civil Rights Movement. This does not in any way do justice or honor to my veteran relatives, and other non-white heroes of that war -- most of whom are dead now; but who were depicted to Europeans as savage subhuman monkeys with tails; were spit upon when they returned in their US military uniforms, and were made to sit in the back of trains where the defeated Nazi prisoners were transported as first class citizens and treated like normal respectable human beings. My father transferred those injuries over to me, and I transferred them over to my son. These are \\"chosen injuries\\" that can never be erased until American begins to live up to its creed as a nation. Brokaw, and no one else can be allowed to skip over them to get to the \\"band of Brothers.\\"Saddest of all, some of those of Brokaw's \\"so-called Greatest Generation,\\" who engaged in this sport of \\"nigger bashing\\" were many Jews themselves. What, one could reasonably ask, could be going on in the heads of such men? How morally conflicted could men be -- to engage in \\"Hitler like behavior\\" in the very fight to free their nation and their own kind from Hitler's gas chambers?No one would be foolish enough to deny that these men were all heroes - whatever their flaws. I am and always will be grateful for what they did and would not dare rain on their parade. But equally, no honest man could deny that collectively they were also moral pigmies. It seems that Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\" and Ike's opening up of Dachau and Auschwitz, for all the world to see, had no discernable effect on the conscience of this so-called greatest generation. Indeed, after the way blacks were treated both before and immediately after the war, it is reasonable to ask: What kind of freedom, exactly were these men fighting for?Even my father tried to apologize for this \\"greatest generation\\" by offering the rationalization that their actions were just \\"a function of the times.\\" God rest his colonized soul, but I wonder what he or others who used that excuse would have said had Hitler used that same excuse? Maybe burning Jews in the ovens was just a \\"function of the times, also?\\"Despite this, I cannot disagree with Brokaw, for it is a certainty that those black men who came from deep off the farms of the South (some had never seen a new pair of shoes until they got their combat boots) and went to war for a nation that hated and despised them, came back and raised families in Apartheid America, were indeed among the Greatest Generation. Three stars."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Being sixteen, I should stereotypically not have much respect for anyone. But I am currently enrolled in the AP Language course at my school, and I had to read four nonfiction books. My father, who has also reviewed this book, encouraged me to pick this as one of them. It was the first book I read, so naturally, all the others which came to follow were interminable. I enjoyed reading this book, and my appreciation grew as well as my love for the characters with every turning page."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"With a catchy title and the author's fame, the book predictably makes most bestseller lists. The author began with an interesting idea - that the generation which grew up during the depression, defeated tyranny as young adults, and then delivered prosperity and freedom from communism as mature adults is a unique generation.Alas, Brokaw chose not to develop the idea or explain why this generation was special apart from the accident of fate. Instead, he simply recounts anecdotes of more or less interesting folks as if their narratives prove anything. I am certain that any marginally competent college journalism student could do the same with any generation - find 30 or so folks from whose stories one could extrapolate a theory of greatness.Brokaw's book typifies the problem of the mass media - lack of any intellectual rigor or depth. Brokaw seems like a nice chap who loved his mom and dad, and decided to write a book to consecrate his love for them. Good son, bad writer."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I found this book to be of immense value as a baby boomer in understanding my parents generation, the sacrifices that were made and the resulting ethics and values that emerged from this world shaking event. As a result of reading it and thinking back to my youth and talking to aunts and uncles (who were all in uniform during the war), a couple of them did not come back from foreign fields of battle. Some became isolationists in outlook and others became confirmed internationalists. One gets a much better appreciation and understanding of the American dream and what the human cost can be when a meglomaniac is allowed to run rampant on the world. Yes, the cost to humanity was immeasurable and unspeakable, however, the ending of the conflict brought about a profound change in political and social systems around the world. Have we done better since V-E and V-J Day's? I would like to think so, having traveled extensively around the world in U.S. military uniform and have seen first hand the impact of America, for better or worse on the world community."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It's true what some critics have said. This book is not the most skillfully or subtly written. It also whitewashes the issues by making the entire generation look like war heroes who later became business and government dynamos. This is not a balanced sociological study however, it's Brokaw's celebration of a generation and a set of values that he admires. Those values are almost exclusively the values of the warrior (warrior in battle and warrior in business). Once that limitation is understood however, the reader can settle back for a fun read. For younger readers who know little of this period in American history, this is a good starting place (but hopefully not an ending place). I congratulate Tom Brokaw for writing it. I only want to tell him that there are other ways to be great, and other generations have explored and will continue to explore those ways."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"When their country and the world was threatened by totalitarian forces, this generation set aside the routines of their daily lives and went to war. Some flew airplanes over hostile territory, some fought on dangerous seas, some landed on foreign soil against well defended enemy entrenchments, and some devoted their skills and energy doing at home what was necessary for victory abroad, but all sacrificed for a cause in which they believed. This is their story. Much like Studs Terkel's &quot;The Great War: An Oral History of World War II,&quot; Tom Brokaw sets the stage and then steps aside to let the people who lived through these perilous times remember and relate.This is a book which, like a fine gourmet meal, needs to be savored in measured helpings. The stories of these men and women need to be read a few at a time then set aside for time to contemplate how intimate and compelling each is. While many are similar, each provides its own unique feeling and impression. To me, all these folks were true heroes in every sense of the word.A few words come to mind as I think back over the totality of the book. These are honor, courage, commitment, duty, self-sacrifice, and patriotism. I think you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am 28 years old and I'm a huge fan of WWII. Listening to my grandpa tell me his stories of being on a ship during the war had always intrigued me. When he passed away a few years ago i felt that i lost that connection...until now. The Greatest Generation is absolutely wonderful. It chronicles the men and women during WWII and their feelings here at home and over seas fighting in that great war. Reading about the courage, integrity, and stamina of these men, i felt as if my grandpa was sitting right there telling me how it was for him. This book shows where family values comes from. How to strive to always do your best and how to become a success in the face of adversity. I could only hope that other men could read this book to see how to be a true to the word, Family Man. How to always love and care for those who are supporting you and how Integrity, Service, and Country are three words that hold this nation together...BRAVO MR. BROKAW!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"One thing is certain - Tom Brokaw is no author. His writing abilities are fair at best. He paints broad conclusions without support. He drills on and on with cliches while giving little attention to the fascinating facts that should have dominated his account. Although many of the individuals for whom chapters are devoted have lived fascinating lives, Brokaw demonstrates an uncanny ability to reduce these stories into fluff summaries. He pays relatively little attention to what one would expect to be a main focus - combat experience. For example, Brokaw states that everyone knows about Bob Dole's war record and injuries so Brokaw won't repeat it in the book. Yet he repeats in detail aspects of Dole's political experiences with which the public is surly much more familiar. The war is much more interesting, and is the basis for the book, so why skip it? Because of these flaws and Brokaw's sub-par writing style, I finished reading this book with less respect for Brokaw's intellect than when I started.On a larger scale, the premise of the book is a simple one - that the World War II generation is the greatest generation America has put forth. However, Brokaw seems to ignore the issue of cause and effect. Brokaw fails to explain why the WWII generation caused the successes of WWII and beyond, as opposed to factual circumstance (the existence of the war and the already-existing might of the USA) simply providing avenues for success. For the majority of the people in the book, there is only a tentative connection between the war and their later endeavors. Wouldn't any generation have come to the defense of the USA? The simple fact that great individuals lived and participated in the war does not prove Brokaw's point. A book narrating the lives of great people could be created for ANY generation. Are the people that make up Generation X less able? Or is it simply that these individuals have not been forced to prove themseleves in a manner such as those in WWII?Of course, the majority of these questions are unanswerable. I agree that the USA and the world owes a great debt to the WWII generation. They have built the world as it is today. Brokaw simply presents no proof, and could not offer any proof, that other generations, if given the same situation, would not have performed as well, if not better."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's best selling book and the generational designation derived from it have created an imbalanced image of those born in the period roughly from 1905 and 1925 who lived through the Great Depression, fought (or supported the war effort) of World War II and enjoyed post war prosperity and endured the Cold War. They did all these things and deserve much, but not all, credit for the positive outcomes over this period.While Brokaw acknowledges post-war developments, most people consider that generation to be defined by the triumph of World War II. What is missing is (1) much of the leadership throughout the Great Depression and World War II were from a still-earlier generation and (2) for good or ill, people from that generation continued to be highly influential in political and cultural affairs for nearly 50 years following World War II. For example, the last American President from that generation finished his term in 1993. \\"Greatest Generation\\" politicians and military leaders presided over the Korea and Vietnam wars, for better or worse. The \\"men in gray flannel suits'of the '50s, the Beats, Tim Leary and the other founders of the drug culture, etc, etc were largely of that generation.Like all groups of people born over, say, a twenty year period -- any twenty year period -- the cohesion of that \\"generation\\" over time is easily exaggerated and becomes a mere stereotype. The \\"Greatest Generation\\" must claim Vietnam, Nixon and much of the cultural turmoil of the post World War II era should be on the generation's resume as well as its successes. \\"The Greatest Generation\\" is a tribute. It should not become a myth."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Is interesting, but quite repetitive. The Greatest Generation holds your interest though. I think the book is a bit long."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I have been wanting this book for awhile. I wasn't disappointed! It was a wonderful, honest book. Very respectful of the generation who lived through the depression and World War II. They didn't whine and didn't expect something to be dropped in their lap. Mr. Brokaw obviously felt great admiration and respect for the people about whom he wrote. A must-read.- Linda"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a stunning read which Tom Brokaw can be justifiably proud to have written. Personal accounts, anecdotes, lifestories, call then what you will, these narratives represent real history which although still within reach in some respects is nevertheless fast slipping away down that old memory trail. It is hard to imagine anyone not being moved by something recorded in these pages. TB has performed a very honorable task in confronting us maybe one last time with the heroics of a magnificent generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I had wanted to read this book for some time and now have the privilege.

My late father was in the infantry in Europe. It helps me understand his life even better than before. If you have, or had a family member from the WW II era, this is a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Great read...Mr. Brokaw sets the stage for what he presents. By no means covering the history of WWII, but talking of life for some WWII veterans...their families and how the experience impacted on their lives."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I cannot believe the other reviews I have read about this book. It made me stop and write my own. This is one of the best books I have EVER read, and I've read ALOT of books, probably in the vicinity of 1,000 or more. Americans today have NO CLUE what our ancestors went through in WW2. They left their families, willingly, and quietly and courageously did the job they were asked to do. They ensured our freedom and our way of life. They came home and asked for no recognition or compensation. They simply resumed their lives, all the while, mourning the loss of their friends, colleagues, and most often, their innocence. Every time I see a Veteran, no matter where I am, I tell him , &quot;Thank You&quot;. Many of them have cried and expressed much appreciation for the gratefulness. I feel this book should be required reading for every American school aged child, for every American for that matter, to help us realize, &quot;at what price freedom?&quot;. It was a great price that was paid, and one that NONE of us should take for granted. This book gives a great insight to these timeless heroes. I only wish I had been alive then and could have been a part of the effort."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this book, however, I felt that the greatest generation was given short shrift by Brokaw's concentration on war experiences. This is my parents' generation and it has always been apparent to me that their greatest strengths (and weaknesses) were forged in both the Depression and in World War II. Yet the significance could have been better shown in their many accomplishments (and failings)in shaping post-WWII America. Maybe an opportunity for a REAL sequel here (the follow-up book, Greatest Generation Speaks, is just a recycling of material not used in this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My husband loves watching documentaries, but cannot sit down and read a book. Until this one! He read everyday, until he finished it, and has started reading it again, 2 months later. His dad was an Army veteran, but he would never talk about it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\" is a classic. This is not sophisticated writing and the format is basic but Brokaw's interviews with dozens and dozens of veterans of World War II, their wives, their children and their comments on how the war affected them and the way they lived the rest of their lives is a loving tribute to his father's generation.Brokaw has sections on regular footsoldiers and sailors, soldiers who went on to become famous such as Casper Weinberger, Bob Dole, Andy Rooney and Julia Child. He also addresses the racism and sexism of the time (and incorrectly asserts that only the Japanese were forcibly removed - several East Coast Italians were removed to western states and their fishing boast were confiscated, although clearly the Japanese were treated much worse as a group). He also talks to soldiers who were wounded during the war and how that affected them.Interesting comment from former pacifist Andy Rooney about his witnessing the liberation of Buchenwald concentration camp: \\"For the first time I knew that any peace is not better than any war.\\" (p. 296)Commentary about the differences of values between generations abounds. I liked this observation about divorce from Peggy Assenzio: \\"It's too easy to get a divorce. We've had our arguments, but we don't give up. When my friends ask whether I ever considered divorce I remind them of the old saying, 'We've thought about killing each other, but divorce? Never.'\\" (p. 239)I also like the observation of a black soldier who philosophically overlooked the racism he experienced: \\"When you get over there and the nation's in trouble you ain't got no black and white. You only got America.\\" (p. 199)"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation is an easy read yet it's also even handed and fair. I agree with Brokaw's point that those who went to war (pacific or europe) are the generation that built America and modernized it. The generation which offered its unconditional love and service to the United States and ran to her aid when she needed them. This generation (now in their late 70s or 80s) came home from the front lines and contributed to the re-construction of a country that suffered from the New Deal, Great Depression and other problems of the 1930s. This book attests to the greatness of that generation and should be on every young man's reading list."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I enjoyed reading this book -- it tells about a generation of people who I knew little about, in a way that made it interesting -- told stories of individuals from all walks of life (public figures to everyday working class contributors, who are much like most of us and our families). Tells how they were impacted by the way, and how the war helped to frame their thought processes and value structures. I wish I had read the book years before (had it been written at that time). Would have helped me to understand my grandparents/parents even better."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I appreciate Tom Brokaw's praise of his &quot;greatest generation,&quot; but after about 100 pages I began to feel as if I was reading the exact same story over and over again. I found there were only so many ways Mr. Brokaw could make his point, and after a while the concluding paragraphs of each story began to sound the same. I agree with other readers who said that as the book goes on, Brokaw begins to sound more and more like a little boy in awe running out of original ways to articulate his point. I will say, however, that I am still glad I read Brokaw's novel because, repetative or not, it paints an informative and warm, if biased, picture of a generation that certainly will be remembered forever."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts. It is a great subject but the shallow treatment did not hold my interest. Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers is much, much better."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The world owes the generation(s) who fought against Nazi and Japanese tyranny in the 1930's and 1940's so very much. We are the heirs to the world they won for us through their courage and often incredible personal sacrifices, and there is probably no adeqaute reward that we could bestow on the ten-million plus heroes in the US alone, who authored for us all the sixty-plus glorious years we've enjoyed. I think Brokaw intended this book not only as a thank you to the ever-dwindling ranks of the WWII generation, but in writing about this sampling of veterans, he wanted to show how modesty and humility was common to so many. Because it is a shared trait in the generation that came into adulthood in the 1940's not to \\"make a big deal of things\\" we who were born later have sometimes found it shamefully easy to forget the ordeal through which they lived. I'm glad a book like this came along in time for the remaining veterans of the 1941-1945 war in Europe and the Pacific to get recognition and have a few of their stories told. What this books does is lets us see what this uncomplaining, self-reliant generation overcame to create the world we live in during the 21st century. Is The Greatest Generation a perfect read that achieves everything it aims to accomplish? No, of course not. But it does contain the twin virtues of being interesting and laudable at the same time, and I'm glad Brokaw and those who worked with him on The Greatest Generation produced this long-overdue work.Further, I hope it finds its way into more than a few classrooms as reading material."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I simply cannot understand why everyone is gushing praise on such a poorly written piece of patriotic blather. Is it that you can readily identify with the author when you plop down on the couch to watch the Nightly News? The rambling, disconnected content of this book left me wanting a refund. I am a proud American, and one who has studied this period of time quite extensively, and this definitely WAS the Greatest Generation indeed! This book, I fear, is going to lead to a host of copycat writings by those who will use their celebrity exposure to command a princely sum for a cliche-ridden hack job of a novel. Enough already!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Ugh, probably every generation thought it was the greatest. While this book is highly popular because it caters to the current generation, it is hardly objective or researched in comparing it to other generations. What is the measure of greatenss? If it is number of lives given for one's country, then surely the Civil War generation gave much more and at a greatest cost to family. If it is technology, then surely it is the current generation. Brokaw never mentions that this same generation produced the nazis and the repressive values that decimated American families once the war was over.

He only mentions the &quot;good&quot; people never really saying much about the &quot;bad&quot; people. This is the same generation that produced Nixon and McCarthy. This is a generation that was heavily conservative, who hated Russia just because they were communists, that swallowed whatever their American government told them. They were also racist, homophobic, miserly and close-minded. Tom Brokaw has painted a picture that is so biased that it almost ruins the reading experience. He is constantly comparing the &quot;greatest generation&quot; with the current generation and his comparisons are unfair. His greatest generation almost ruined this country, the current young generation hasn't been given a chance yet and when they do I hope they make Brokaw eat his words.

This book highlights the struggles that our grandparents had when they were young and inspires us to overcome the little trials in our everyday lives."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As the well over 400th reviewer of this book I mostly wanted to give it a well deserved &quot;5 stars&quot; and state simply that it was an enjoyable, educational and enlightening read. Perhaps Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; is the last great generation. One in which family, honor and love of &quot;home&quot; seem to have been deeply engrained in those who lived it. I loved this book and wish that many of the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; members of my family were still alive so I could salute them, hug them, or simply shake their hand."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I received this book as a gift, and actually was quite reluctant to read it- How interesting could a bunch of stories about unknown men and women be? Very interesting is the answer. This is the only book of its kind- that I know of- that takes this perspective on the World War II effort- and, possibly, this perspective is one of the most important that we have overlooked. Machines didn't win the war, big business didn't win the war, the leaders of the free world didn't win the war-- Individual people won the war. And that's why I think this is possibly the best book about World War II I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Great book. But by definition success in adulthood requires raising successful children. The proclaimed Greatest Generation was raised by the truly greatest generation--their parents. They deserve the title. The ones who raised some fairly large families in very difficult times requiring tremendous faith, perseverance and sharing. Growing up in the Great Depression--from those whom I know--was just a matter of fact. On the other hand, raising a family then must have been gut-wrenching. That generation was the one that really stepped up. And the \\"Greatest Generation\\"--they became a bit self-centered, complacent and let's face it--somewhat full-of-themselves. For it was on their watch that morals, ethics and values all headed south, while materialism and keeping up with the Jones's became the end-all. How about a sequel. Sorry Tom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw does a commendable job of describing how the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; earned its name. For those who are interested in which generation is likely to be the next great one, I highly recommend a new book titled &quot;Millennials Rising&quot; by generational authors Neil Howe and Bill Strauss. They believe that in the cycle of generations, today's youngsters--the Millennials (born 1982 to the present)--will replace the G.I. generation as the next great generation. The Millennials are already reversing many of the negative social trends associated with the last generation of young adults, i.e. the Generation Xers."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"IT SEEMS TO MANY OF US THAT AMERICA IS GOING DOWNHLL. OF COURSE THE YOUNG HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT FROM OLD FOLKS FOR A LONG TIME. HOWEVER, IF THOSE UNDER 40 WERE FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK ALONG WITH THIER CHILDREN, I FEEL ALL OF US WOULD BE BETTER OFF. IT SEEMS AS A NATION, WE HAVE LOST THE SENSE OF LOYALITY, HONOR, INTEGRETY, SHAME, AND WORK ETHIC THAT WAS SO VISABLE IN THIS GENERATION THAT SHOULD BE HONORED. WE WOULD ALL DO WELL TO EMULATE THEIR VALUES AND PAY HOMAGE TO THEIR MEMORY INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING THEIR TIME IS GONE. AS LONG AS THE FLAG WAVES, THEIR TIME IS NOT GONE AND WE SHOULD ALL BOW DOWN AND GIVE THANKS THAT THEY WERE HEAR TO HANDLE THE PROBLEMS AS THEY DID. GOD HELP US ALL IF THE SAME PROBLEMS WERE FOSTERED ON TODAYS GENERATION."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I truly thought that this was a moving and educational book. As someone very removed from the WWII generation, I found this compostion of heroics informational and emotional.Portions of the writing were very cumbersome and heavy, so much so that I had to walk away from the book at times and pick it up again later. However, I do think the entire book is worth reading. I would suggest purchasing the book and reading it in bits and pieces. It would be an excellent addition to anyone's book collection.I think that while everyone should read this book, that everyone who knows a man or woman that came of age during WWII, whether fighting in Europe, Japan, or on our homefront, HAS TO. It will, perhaps, lend meaning and purpose to our past, and shed a light in the direction of our future."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Book Description and Review After visiting Normandy, in 1984 for the Fortieth Anniversary of D-Day, Tom Brokaw was inspired by the stories of the vets of World War II. Brokaw described this as a life changing experience for he could see the excitement and fear at D-Day. Men would point out their posts and describe the action they had seen and encountered on that fateful day. At the Fiftieth Anniversary he said, \\"I think this is the greatest generation any society has ever produced.\\" He wrote the book to prove this bold statement and give a tribute to the men and women that lived in this time.Each story is amazing in its own way including everything POWs to WAVES. The book is full of love stories, adventures, and accounts of incredible bravery. One man received a Congressional Metal of Honor for his courage while administering plasma in a war field. Another went up against the speed and agility of the Japanese airforce with amazing results. Some women went to work on the homefront, filing the jobs left by the men, while others joined the Women's division of the Army. Brokaw describe them eloquently when he wrote, \\"I am in awe of them, and feel privileged to have been a witness of their sacrifices.\\"If Brokaw made one mistake, it is unceasingly inserting himself in the story. His life is irrelevant to this generation because he is younger than these war heroes are. Yet the book remains an excellent primary source history of peoples lives in World War II. It proves how mankind can rise to greatness when he is called to do so."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A great generation but an average book. Brokaw's celebrity status provided the publicity but you it's just plain boring after the first couple of chapters. The writing is flat and unimaginative."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a bad and dangerous book. It's a bad book because it's boring, repetitious, simplistic and naive. The entire book is an ovation for those who participated and were heroic during WWII. I am not criticizing the fine people Mr. Brokaw portrays. I am criticizing the repetitiousness of Mr. Brokaw's effort. He's banging the same drum for 400 pages, and it's very tedious. Mr. Brokaw is naive in his praise of the veterans 'modesty' in not discussing their WWII experience. The failure to talk can be caused by trauma, selfishness or hidden pride. The WWII stories my dad told me were funny, scary, rude and more entertaining than anything Mr. Brokaw tells in his book. The book is dangerous for the following reason. If we accept his argument that this was the Greatest American Generation,then to be a good generation, we have to go fight a war, and be heroic in a variety of ways. It's blatantly militaristic and contemptuous of those of us who work hard, and help our kids have happy lives. I'm going to reread Catch 22, and watch the Best Years of Our Lives to get the bad taste out of my mouth. I give Mr. Brokaw 1 star because he writes well."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw has managed to take wonderful raw material and produce a book that would not challenge a junior high school student. The book is shallow and banal. I am sorry I wasted my money on it and even sorrier that he will receive it. Surely a man who makes his living with words can do better than this."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw writes beautiful narratives about personal experiences during the Great Depression and WWII. The Greatest Generation is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"When we bought this for my wife's grandfather, we knew he would enjoy it. Teachers trying to convey the efforts of those who came of age in the late 30s-40s such as myself are very lucky Mr. Brokaw not only did the book, but also read it. Stories are presented in short pieces about individuals and what they experienced, which can be used as separate items or as a good read of a great book. The fact that Brokaw himself read the material is also helpful, since his presentation and tone are very relaxing and interesting to hear. His interest in his topic is sincere and shows, giving this book a great deal of respect for those it wishes to portray. I have bought more copies for others ince then, and use this book and its sequels in class very successfully. This will be an audiobook you will listen to several times, and appreciate each time you do."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"When I read the book The Greatest Generation I was mesmorized.Each and every story is a vivid depiction of someone's life. Their trials and tribulations throughout the war are praised upon and greatly appreciated. I found the book hard to put down. I felt drawn into the people as they told their stories. Each one of them had humongous courage. I remember every story distinctly, every person sticks out in my mind.Reading The Greatest Generation gave me a better insight to what went on in the minds of the war heroes whose numbers are unfortunately dwindling. This book was a very important book to write. It compiles many different stories and points of view into one anthology of greatness. Even if you don't like reading about history, this book will have you hooked from the beginning. It captivates you every second you read.The Greatest Generation is a great compiliation of people's lives. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I am sure you will too!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is wonderous and once read will ultimately become one of the reader's favorite reads. Tom Brokaw incorporates history with life stories of a wide variety of people to turn out a fast paced page turner. The Greatest Generation has great content and is fit for all ages. The book revolves around those raised during the Depression and those who fought in WWII. Truely this book will inspire the reader just as it has inspired so many, for without this generation the world would be a different place and the American dream would be obstructed. This book is a must for any literate person, no excuses."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"then this book should be open and in your lap. mr. brokaw and company have done a magnificent service in resurrecting the passion of commitment and patriotism these american's have exuded for 70+ years. we may know these people as our brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, parents and grandparents but soon you will know them as the people who made difficult decisions and sacrifices for our freedom and future. this will give you a new understanding of why your family and friends who lived through this era are the way they are. in my opinion, this book should be required reading for every high school student in the country."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I really looked forward to this book, based on my respect for Tom Brokaw and what I had heard. Unfortunately, he makes his point with a sledgehammer, telling sapppy stories with the same theme over and over, spoon feeding you the point, in case you somehow missed it. Grandma and Grandpa were great, generous, self-sacrificing gods and goddesses, and here are a thousand treacly repetitive stories why. This book condescends to the reader, unfortunately, probably with all good intentions but annoying results. I wasn't able to finish this book, and that's rare for me."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"With true stories about simple American heroes, The Greatest Generation is worthy of comparison to the best books about the men and women who fought and won WWII, The Winds of War, The Stephen Ambrose books, and The Triumph &amp; the Glory come to mind, but perhaps the greatest praise for the greatest generation is THAT EVEN TOM BROKAW WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HONOR AND DECENCY WHEN HE SAW IT. There's hope for NBC News yet!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This was not the greatest generation. This was the last bigoted generation. Bigotry today exists in smaller and smaller pockets, hangovers from the generation Brokaw prostrates himself to. My older friend tells me that she likes working with younger men than her own generation because she gets treated like an equal instead of a subordinate. Says it all really - the greatest generation doesn't even like itself. Is Tom Brokaw out to make a buck with the old \`it were better in my time' malarkey, or is he stupid? Given that he is already very wealthy, and has never before struck me as an idiot, I'm going for the only other option - he wanted more limelight. By the way, the book was repetitive. If they were that great, why weren't there more examples to call on than the same schmaltz delivered time and again."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. Needless to say the exploits of this generation were outstanding, but most did only what they should have done. I'm inclined to think that the generation that produced Tom's &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; was the greatest generation. I was also disappointed in some of his celebrity selections. His were good stories, but I believe there are better stories out there."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"One needs nothing more than to read the chapter &quot;dedicated&quot; to Joe Foss to reveal Tom Brokaw as little more than just another dutiful, liberal, left wing, media wimp. How is it that one would clutter a chapter on a bonafide American hero with the stature of Medal of Honor recipient, Joe Foss, with an absolute out of context, and nonsense reference to Senator George McGovern? Brokaw refers to McGovern's heroic World War II action in which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross, and makes no real reference to the Medal of Honor exploits of the chapter's hero, Joe Foss. To characterize McGovern as a war hero and political icon with no discussion of Foss' heroic battlefield achievements, reveals Brokaw as one unfit to even begin to discuss such a man as Joe Foss. He clearly does not understand the difference between a MOH, and a DFC. If he does not understand that difference, he is equally unfit to write a book dedicated to the Greatist Generation. I used to respect the author until I read his book. Brokaw reveals himself in this chapter and others, as just another media liberal who cannot rise above his left wing tradition. He does not even have the integrity to put aside his liberal political agenda in tribute to a generation, that I can see now, he in no way could begin to represent. Brokaw even goes so far as to take a shot a President Nixon in this chapter. What does a swipe at Nixon have to do with Joe Foss? It was disgusting. The worst thing that a military man can say of an individual is that he is in any way &quot;unfit.&quot; Brokaw is unfit to speak of a generation of heroes, and certainly not one of the likes of Joe Foss in the same breath as George McGovern."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Anybody who wants to know what being an American is all about, read this."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It is not worth buying ! If this a must read for you go to our public library. You just might thank me!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"What were you doing when you were 17? Ask that question today and some might tell you ... 'Participating in aschool clubs' or 'Hanging out' ... a whole generation was fighting for our freedom ..Thank you .. Your sacrifices were great and we appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"After sharing the wonderful accounts of this self sacrificing generation so fairly, Tom Brokow has currently chosen to throw them all overboard. Everything they fought against is finding its way into our society today, under the blind eye of today's main stream media. Brokow's lack of journalistic integrity and bias has been completely exposed. His recent interview on the PBS Charlie Rose show has demonstrated, with Brokow's own words, he didn't do his journalistic duty and find out who Senator Obama is. Tom and Charlie Rose bemoaned the fact they know nothing about Obama. Isn't it interesting that he can research and produce such a good book about my father's generation, the Great Depression and WWII, but can't or won't do any research into the alliances, college years, internet fund raising sources and financial activities of a man seeking the highest office in our country. Tom really doesn't respect my father's generations' accomplishments because he has decided to tread all over them. Thank you so much Tom, for your journalistic incompetence."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Coming on the heels of the terrific movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; Brokaw's book is sadly repetitive. One would think that World War II was the greatest thing Humanity was capable of. There were alot of interesting anecdotes, but not much of a point; what did the &quot;greatest generation&quot; go on to produce? Smug baby boomers. Unfortunately, that's there legacy."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My father was a WWII veteran. His service days were seldom discussed. Faded photos of a strikingly handsome young man of German and Irish descent are among my few mementos from the days of his infantry training in Newfoundland and his tour of duty in Southern Italy. His older brother spoke often of New Caledonia, doubtless the only foreign adventure of a naive young adolescent who matured too quickly in the Great Depression. Dad's brother thirteen months his junior, was a medic somewhere in the European theater. He, unlike my father, enjoyed the company of fellow vets in his later years. His pleas to my father went unheeded; Daddy was not a joiner, for one thing. For another, it has always been a suspicion among my siblings and myself that the memories of war were far from pleasant for my father.He lived until three weeks before the birth of his first grandchild, my oldest daughter. At that time I was almost twenty-five, and in the quarter of a century I had spent being his daughter, he had been for me kind, loving, stubborn, opinionated -- a mildly prejudiced, yet honest, man who could spin a mesmerizing story, tell hilarious off-color jokes or rant about a perceived injustice, depending upon the swing of his mood. And, it was his moods we were taught to tiptoe around - there was often about him a resigned air of despondency and cynicism. There was the perception of a man who had tilted at windmills and lost, badly and often.After a tough bout with multiple hernia surgeries and emphysema sidelined him into an early retirement in his mid-forties, he reluctantly gave up his beloved,unfiltered Lucky Strikes. Until his death at sixty-two, he would often absentmindedly reach for a cigarette from his top pocket after a meal. At fleeting moments, his penetratingly beautiful blue eyes would gaze at something far away. &quot;What are you thinking of daddy,&quot; I wanted so to ask. I always hesitated; the asking seemed an unforgivable offense, a trespass onto the privacy of the place to which he had withdrawn. He viewed the world as a tough place, trying too hard was not his recommendation nor his example to his four children. You accept your lot in life, whatever it is, and you just hang in there until life is over. End of story. I failed to learn anything about motivation, ambition or perseverance from my father then. It was not until years after he was lost to me that I realized his iconoclastic independence could teach me volumes.There remains in my older brother's possession, an army trunk filled with the memorabilia of daddy's days in the Civilian Conservation Corps and infantry unit. Once, on a rare occasion when he opened it, daddy teasingly held up photographs of luscious Italian beauties he met during his stay overseas. I, fanatically romantic, tossed aside yellowed letters and his prized pictures of the Third Reich, staring in consternation at photos of buxom, blonde beauties lovingly pressing against the bodies of thin, young American servicemen. It was then I learned that not every Italian woman was of the Neapolitan, Sophia Loren breed. No, my father noted, his blonde hair and blue eyes were his ticket into many family meals from friendly Southern Italians eager to open their homes to a lonely, simpatico Americano.Upon his return home, his stoic, but very Irish Catholic mother admitted burning candles for her three older sons daily before her statue of the Blessed Virgin Mother. Her relief that he had not surprised her with an Italian daughter-in-law was soon stifled with this revelation: &quot;Mom,&quot; he told her, &quot;do you have any idea how many Italian mamas decimated the Italian candle supply, praying equally as hard that they would not get stuck with us as their new sons-in-law? Mary, good Jewish mother that she is, must be so confused from all these requests.&quot;Brokaw's The Greatest Generation is a compilation of many heartwarming and heart-wrenching tales of the Big One, both abroad and on the homefront. Far from a glorification of war, he instead gives us glimpses into one special generation of American men and women. Arriving in Normandy in the spring of 1984 to prepare a documentary for the 40th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion, Brokaw admits he was &quot;simply looking forward to what I thought would be an interesting assignment.&quot; Instead his epiphany prodded him to anthologize the stories he heard walking the beaches with American veterans who &quot;...faced great odds and a late start, but (they) did not protest. At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting, often hand to hand, in the most primitive conditions possible, across the bloodied landscape of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria. They fought their way up the necklace of South Pacific Islands few had ever heard of before and made them a fixed part of American history - islands with names like Iwo Jima, Guadacanal, Okinawa. They were in the air every day, in skies filled with terror, and they went to sea on hostile waters far removed from the shores of their homeland.&quot;These are tales of ordinary people, made extraordinary by events beyond their control, events that earned them an unrequested place in history. Here was a people who, fully realizing they lived in an imperfect democratic experiment, came to do combat with the absolute evil of two regimes seeking to destroy human rights and indulge in ethnic cleansing. Veterans, like Andy Rooney, then a young reporter for The Stars and Stripes who went to Buchenwald to witness firsthand the rumors of atrocities there. He later wrote: &quot;I was ashamed of myself for ever having considered refusing to serve in the Army. For the first time I knew that any peace is not better than any war.&quot;Brokaw's book is one you'll want to access often for all its poignancy, tragedy, triumph, humor, pride, sacrifice and unbelievable courage. The men, women and families who choose to share their reminisces are but a handful, yet their accumulated experiences will lend an understanding to why Brokaw felt compelled to offer us a collection like this. Further, you will close it knowing why Brokaw, like his readers, have no choice but to conclude: &quot;As I came to know many of them, and their stories, I became more convinced of my judgment on that day marking the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day. This is the greatest generation any society has produced. ###"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Wonderful stories about Americans who sacrificed for the good of the country.

Highly memorable."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"You would have to be dead to not be touched by the stories in the book, but I found Mr. Brokaw's writing style a bit dry. The writing ended up sucking the life out of the stories."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The term Greatest Generation might smack of journalistic hyperbole or nationalistic jingoism, but the more I read the works of Stephen E. Ambrose (D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, Band of Brothers) or watch any of the documentaries about World War II -- especially on this 60th Anniversary of the D-Day landings and other landmark battles of history's largest clash of arms -- that will air from Memorial Day till June 6, the more I am inclined to agree with Tom Brokaw's use of that term to describe the men and women who came of age in the 1930s and '40s and created modern America.Brokaw, one of America's best television journalists and anchor of NBC's Nightly News, not only coined the phrase &quot;the Greatest Generation&quot; when he wrote this amazingly fascinating and inspiring collection of personality profiles of men and women, some famous (Bob Dole, Julia Child, George H.W. Bush), some not-so-famous but prominent (Norman Mineta, Daniel Inouye), and some neither prominent nor famous yet vitally essential (Leonard Lomell, Jeanette Gagne Norton) who either saw combat, contributed to the war effort, or endured the hardships of being separated from loved ones without succumbing to fear or giving in to selfishness or self-pity.In the same concise yet utterly convincing style of his network news writing, Brokaw draws the reader into his chronicles of 50 men and women whose experiences encompass a wide spectrum of the American World War II experience. He captures, for instance, humorist Art Buchwald's seemingly unlikely stint as a Marine in the South Pacific, at first (and almost disastrously) loading ordnance onto Marine Corsair fighter-bombers, then more wisely reassigned to work on the squadron's newsletter and drive trucks. In five pages, Brokaw wonderfully gets the essence of Buchwald's satiric-yet-gentle personality, while at the same time revealing that the least-likely-to-be-a-Marine was given a parade by then-outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell.The Greatest Generation is full of vivid personality profiles like Buchwald's. Some, such as that of Len Lomell, highlight bravery in combat; others are like Jeanette Gagne Norton's, whose husband Camille Gagne was killed in Holland during Operation Market-Garden. The recollections Brokaw presents here are full of drama and laughter, of happiness, love, and sometimes shame, but there is no bitterness or self-pity. For these are the men and women that saved the world from tyranny...and made our country what it is today."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw pays tribute to a deserving generation in his book &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; However, he does so in a rather clumsy manner. Just try and read the book without constantly picturing Tom Brokaw reading it too you from his news desk. His prose is consistent with that of a news anchor, which unfortunately does not flow when read. At one point he makes some statement that this generation is &quot;the greatest generation anywhere ever.&quot; I mean come on, that is just absurd. My advice is to skip the sections where he writes about the generation in general (the intros, conclusion, etc.) and only read the biographical sections. These sections are the heart of the book. In my opinion, one gets more from the mouths of those who lived through it than one gets from Brokaw's ineffective attempts to glorify a whole generation. In addition, I was bothered by the book's very conservative tone. One of the most important effects of WWII was the ideas, art, and literature that came out of it. Brokaw gives no lip service to those who came out on the cutting edge of modern thought. Instead, he is intent to focus on the comparatively bland veterans who just say things like &quot;Kids these days dont have a sense of responsibility&quot;, &quot;It taught me how to focus&quot;, etc. He should have thrown in a portrait of Vonnegut, or Heller, or someone like that."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A credible and capable journalist as Brokaw is he should know better than to compare apples to oranges with his declaration that WWII was the 'greatest generation'. NO ONE, even a knowledgeable man like Tom (sic sic), can make a statement like that. Each generation in the world (and not just those individuals in the USA, Tom) has their own positives and negatives. As an X'er that served in the Army during the Gulf War, and now a capable employee working at a major telecommunications company in the private sector, I can assure you that today's armed forces are more than equal to the task of a (God forbid) third world war. This book disappointed me a great deal. I went into it hoping I'd get a window into this incredible period of time and the people involved. What I GOT was a lecture that reminded me of the tired old tales I've heard a million different times from grouchy old men I've met in my life. Building up or promoting one generation doesn't mean you have to tear down another (or ALL the others!). Mr. Brokaw should know this as a journalist and should've edited out the 'sour grapes' comments from the men and women interviewed. The WWII generation was great, no question at all, but the greatest? And the speculation that todays men and women couldn't have done the same in the same time is laughable. It's the same as saying that those men and women couldn't have achieved the technological feats that the our generation has. There's no way they could've built the Internet or the Stealth Bomber from scratch (a common thread/boast in this book), but I not arrogant enough to assume that they couldn't have if the roles were reversed. It's a shame this 'downspeak' runs throughout the memoirs of this book. It taints otherwise heroic, inspiring, and note-worthy accomplishments. X'ers, don't read this book without expecting some bullets shot in your direction. There's enough for all of those to earn are own combat badges."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw was inspired to write this narrative as he attended the 40th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion. He went as a reporter and came back as a man on a mission. His mission was to honor a generation of men & women who responded bravely to their personal calls to duty.This book was written, not so much by Mr. Brokaw, as it was by the men & women who lived during this time. As Captain Joe Foss, a Marine F-4 Wildcat fighter pilot, who participated in the fierce battle for Guadalcanal would say, \\"those of us who lived have to represent those of us who didn't make it\\". Mr. Foss is himself, the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor.THE GREATEST GENERATION bears witness to the young men & women who gave up their youth in order to sacrifice themselves & their own ambitions to the cause of a greater good. In the course of serving the effort to win WWII, their everyday acts of bravery & heroism changed the course of the society & the world. This is not to say, that everyone involved in the war effort acted honorably towards one another; Mr. Brokaw shines a light on little known acts of hatred & prejudice that continued on despite the premise that we were fighting a war against an enemy that had destructive racial policies of it's own in place. So, in some places & times, as always, the cream did not rise to the top, and the better nature of people did not appear to show blacks, the Japanese, Hispanics, American Indians & women the way to a new world unfettered by racism & crushing prejudice. They fought for the country they loved, nontheless. These men & women forged on in the only system that was known to them and in the process, made life better for all of us. They gave birth to ideas that would serve as instuments for change in society, some of which we would not see come to the fullness of fruition even in our own lifetimes.Mr. Brokaw invites you to get to know them and realize how the world we live in today came to be shaped by everyday, ordinary young people. They were children during the Great Depression and youths in their teens and twenties when they answered the call, in a wave of unparalled patriotism brought on by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the banded together and fought a battle to victory against an enemy bent on destroying the world as we know it. They were loved & revered by those in the countries they liberated. They were baptized by blood & fire, they were forged into steel, then they returned home, to their families and resumed their lives. They changed the world in their own indelible yet unassuming ways. Meet THE GREATEST GENERATION."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; tells the story of ordinary Americans coping with an extraordinary time. Their collective ability to overcome the difficulties presented by the Second World War and the subsequent challenges they faced after the war left an indelible impression on Brokaw. And it will do the same to you.The stories of all kinds of Americans are here: both overseas and on the home front, men and women, white and black (and Japanese) - showing the effort put forth by this generation was truly a &quot;group effort,&quot; and establishing them as a generation worthy of taking its place among the others in American history.As opposed to other reviewers, I don't get the impression that Brokaw was trying to discredit those that came either before or after this particular time in history. Rather, Brokaw makes the case that, because of the battle with Fascism the &quot;free world&quot; was facing at the time, the hardships endured and sacrifices made by these people held greater significance than perhaps ever before (or since). For if these people failed, and Fascism prevailed, what would be the state of the world today?It is not just the later US generations that should be thankful to them, but rather all peoples around the world who owe a debt of gratitude to these remarkable men and women. The tremendous fortitude that enabled them (along with all those around the globe engaged in the struggle) to withstand the destructive dictatorships bent on world domination is legendary and not to be forgotten.Ever."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a recent college graduate and a card carrying Gen-Xer, it is hard for me to grasp what went on in America before I was born. As long as I have been alive, America has seen the proliferation of the personal computer, the greatest economic boom in history, and the omnipresence of media. Things have been good to America over the past 25 years. There is no way I could have imagined the sacrifices of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; had I never read the book of the same title by Tom Brokaw.As a graduate of Florida State University, I am very grateful for Mr. Brokow's generous donation of some of his materials to our WWII museum. Before reading Mr. Brokaw's book, I took for granted all that I had been given in life. I never had to face the possibility of the draft, endure the separation from loved ones, and risk my life to defend the honor of my country. With Mr. Brokaw's interviews of the soldiers and their families contained in &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; I can have a greater appreciation for my life.Brokaw's meticulous research is apparent in his narrating of the stories of the people contained in the book. All of the members of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; are true testaments to strength and courage and are the reason for the great prosperity our country has seen over the past 25 years. Read this book and learn from the character traits of these heroes, apply them to your own life and our country will be exponentially better 25 years from now."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"to the men and women of this time period. We all hear the stories growing up, but never the details, and the depth of what these people did for us. How can we ever repay them, that's the only question.Mr. Brokaw's book is a very good read, not outstanding, but very good. I enjoyed the stories, and the learning about what these people of the Greatest Generation gave of themselves for our way of life. Sadly, I feel very un-patriotic by being a bit critical of this book, but feel the need to relate a few items.First, although all the stories are moving, inspiring and lead me to get really upset, I can't help but notice the repeatitive nature of the story telling. About half way through the book, it all started to sound the same, even though it was different. Just an observation.Secondly, I totally disagree with Mr. Browkaw's defense of the phrase &quot;Medal of Honor winners&quot;. He defends his position, nicely, but there is no way that this is correct. Having had the great fortune to have worked with and hosted Medal of Honor receipients at patriotic functions, I can guarantee that Mr. Brokaw is wrong in his titling. The Medal of Honor is not a &quot;prize&quot; won during some game or contest, it is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a soldier, who fears not for his life, but cares only of those he hopes to protect and aid. Enough of the soap box.I recommend that you read this book, it's very moving and will help build your partiotisim, of which none of us can get enough of right now. Thanks Tom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is well written and should be mandatory reading for Congress, the President, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff before they consider sending anyone off to war. Brokaw vividly describes how war (and WWII in particular) effects individuals. Those in combat as well as those who stay behind. Where this book falls short, however, is in Brokaw's theory that this was the Greatest Generation. This same book could have been written about the generation who fought the Civil War, WWI or any other war. Also, the individuals he writes about often disprove his own arguments. For example, several times during the early chapters Brokaw writes that this generation didn't believe in divorce. It just wasn't an option. Later in the book, however, he talks about one individual and &quot;his ex-wives.&quot; This isn't the only contradiction in the book. Brokaw's attempt to make this book prove something more detracts from what would otherwise be an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Look past the NBC's anchorman's image. Kudo to Brokaw inspite of the book's negatives. More authors should focus on the positive aspects of &quot;everyday people.&quot; Ordinary folks made America what it is; everyday people will decide its future. I like The Greatest Generation's stories because they centered on grass-root Americans. A theme Steinbeck knew well. Speaking only about America -- it is indeed a time and culture which desperately needs links with its past and grounding in that which is real. I recommend reading a less-known book entitled LIFE WITH NOAH to all who have an interest in personal narratives. In it you will find a vanished way of American life and a friendship that forged a solid trust between a young man and the Adirondack Mountains last hermit. The writing will soothe and rejuvenate anyone experiencing a meltdown toward American society. It embraces life's simple gifts. Basic human values are explored. The vast collection of vintage photographs adds to the book's appeal."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview,most of whom went into the service as officers,and later became politicians. Where are the uneducated,poverty stricken youths who went into the armed forces,fought and died for their country, and, those who survived,returned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted? The author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the service,making their service in our armed forces strictly voluntary; and always as officers,most-repeat-,most of whom never heard a shot fired,the exception proving the rule"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Without a doubt, Tom Brokaw's the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; is a wonderful compilation of the stories of the men and women who fought in World War II and continued that fight into the social sphere. It does well to bring you a representative sample of the &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; from the political elite to your next door neighbor who lives an ordinary life. It brings to life a generation that has so long taken a back seat to the attention-getters of the Baby Boomer generation. It deserves the recognition and Brokaw's book does it justice. Yet was it the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;? I still do not know, but what is for certain is that this book will not tell you nor will it make a competent argument for it. Perhaps from that standpoint it is good for social discourse, a catalyst for much deeper thought on the subject. Unfortunately, historically it is tragic. One could not think of a more fallacious argument than to make a statement, and then justify it with 30 examples, however touching and inspiring they might be, and then conclude that that generation is better than any generation ever produced by any society merely from those examples. What of the Generation of the American Revolution? Certainly they made sacrifices, certainly they had political and social contributions (I'm writing this because of them), and certainly they fought a &quot;tyranny&quot; of some kind. One could even argue that that tyranny was much closer to home and more threatening than the spread of fascism. Yet any sort of comparative analysis, which is necessary when claiming that anything is the greatest or best, never is made in Brokaw's book. So read it for its memories, read it for it's light shed on a generation so often left in umbrage, but do not read it if you are interested in an intelligent discussion of what makes a generation great, and why this one was so. After all, that would be really hard, and wouldn't sell as many books."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was born in 1958, and have two uncles in &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. They are both deceased now, but served in WWII, one in the Pacific, and one in Europe. I never talked to them about that time, but this book helped me to understand it much better. I have asked my mother to share with me what she remembers as a young teenager at that time. I listened to the book on tape, and was filled with emotion and pride for them, so much so that I stopped my car at the nearest pay phone to call my mother, long distance, and ask her about it. The most important point I think Tom Brokaw makes, is that these people thrived on responsibility, the more the better. This is what is missing in society today. Thank you Tom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was originally interested book after watching Mr. Brokaw's interview on &quot;Tim Russert&quot; a few weeks ago (he was actually talking about his 3rd book about the Greatest Generation). I will admit that I have been caught up in all the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; hoopla recently, but this book transcends that. The first 3/4 of the book had me engrossed--I think because it was about ordinary people who did extraordinary things. The last 1/4 didn't have my attention as much--again, I think it was because it was about &quot;famous&quot; people. Although their stories were interesting, they weren't as personal as the non-famous ones.This book has awakened in me the need to talk to my grandparents about the war--before it is too late. If that's the only lesson anyone takes away from this book, then I think that it has done its job."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is the book about the generation that went through the great depression and WWII, which for most of us is our parents and grandparents. This generation has gone too long underappreciated as useless old farts by the Boomers, Xers and the latest generation. We forget that they built modern America thorugh their sacrifices and just plain old determination. While one might quibble with Brokaw's claim of this generation being the greatest (how about the revolutionary war and civil war gens), they are unquestionably the greatest alive today. Brokaw chronicles in easy-to-read vivid vignettes the lives of an assortment of WWII vets from all walks of life. While one might yearn for a bit more detail on the transition from wartime sacrifice to peacetime production, its still a must read for putting the accomplishments of this great generation into perspective."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I love the generation described in this book. These are our parents(I'm a war baby, not a baby boomer) and they created an environment which has opended up a whole array of new opportunities for us and our children. My own father was not in the military but he got up at the crack of dawn each day to take a subway ride from Harlem to the New York Port Authority. From there he caught a bus out to Curtis Wright Corp in New Jersey where he assembled airplane engines. He was one of the first blacks to work there and probably only got the job because of the war effort. However, I take exception to the idea that there is something intrinsically unique about this or any other generation. The people Tom Brokaw described were confronted with a great challenge and rose to it. I don't think the younger generations around today would just cave in if confronted with the same kind of challenge. What that world war II generation illustrates is the greatness of the human spirit. Finally, I don't hink Mr Brokow intended to belittle the contriubtions of other nations to the war effort, hewas merely concentrating on those who were our parents nd grandparents in this country."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is appallingly written, brazenly self-promoting and transparently biased to the left. It is full of cloying rhetorical questions (&quot;They never shared their lunch with a starving Japanese child,&quot; supposedly characterizing younger Congressional Republicans -- how would Brokaw know who they'd shared lunch with, anyway?) and laughable self-contradictions (in a book that purportedly applauds the old-fashioned values, he criticizes Dole for being out of touch with the younger generation's self-absorption in his presidential campaign). Whenever he can work it in, he slings it to the Republicans, those meanies who care about no one but themselves. Critical thinkers will find this book superficial and opportunistic."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw couldn't resist sprinkling - and at times launching - his political views throughout a book that was touted to be a tale of \`the greatest generation'. Certainly, all who fought and died during World War II did so, in part, to protect Brokaw's Constitutional right to express his beliefs freely, even in a book (supposedly) about them. I was around during those war years, and remember all to well the stars in the windows, including the gold one right next door for a Navy Grumman TBF radioman, who had been like a big brother to me. From my perspective, Brokaw showed bad manners and poor taste in soap-boxing his own pellucid biases, and thereby did a disservice to all - including the less privileged not featured in his book Of course it could be that good manners and good judgment are just two more values that are dying off as part of the \`the greatest generation'. The one unadulterated aspect of the book is its' title, &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; - That is factual. (Anyone who wants to write a chronicle of history, particularly one covering the WW II era, should STUDY and use Doris Kearns Goodwin's , &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot; as a primer.)"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I have spent a lot of time over the past years reading about different aspects of World War Two, from the different battles to the equipment used, but this was the first time that I had a full book of individual stories about the average GI and the story he had to tell. There are many reviews here that detail the book; I just wanted to add that at first I thought this would be a dull book. Sure I had heard all the buzz about the book, but I thought that was more to do with the author then the actual book. I even had doubts that a newsreader could become an author. I am happy to report that I was wrong, first off Brokaw did not try to muddle around with the stories to get any glory for his writing style, he just told them like they were told to him. I think this is the reason the book is so powerful, it is like you are sitting at your Grandparents home and they are telling you stories. The stories are wonderful (as much as you can say that about war stories) and they really convey not just the battle, but all the emotion (good and bad) that the GI felt. This is a great book and a must for any WW 2 collection."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Entertaining book overall but was a little &quot;hokie&quot; in some parts. The author chose an interesting format by compiling a collection of individual stories about World War II. All the stories share a common theme of sacrifice, courage and duty. A very fast and easy read. Students of World War II will especially enjoy this work. RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw wrote this book after years of research and interviews, almost 15 years. This book represents their stories. It tells the story of America and the people who's lives were forever changed by Front-page-story events. It is the story of despair and success, triumph and defeat, women and minorities fighting for their causes, soldiers and Marines, and of ordinary people who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances. Many interesting people contributed to this perfectly written book. I would certainly recommend this book, as Tom Brokaw constructed a masterpiece. Just like being a US Marine, this book makes me proud to be an American. Semper Fi"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I too was very excited when I spied &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; on the shelf. Tom Brokaw always struck me as a dignified, articulate and down to earth man (on the book jacket he sports a $69 Casio watch). I still feel that way, but I don't think he's a great author or historian.The book is an easy read. I found myself uplifted from the stories of those who came from obscure backgrounds, stared with little, faced adversity and yet managed to rise to great achievement.About halfway through I got tired of the brass band blasting my head about how special this generation is. I got tired of hearing the oft repeated lines: &quot;...well I guess that's just the way I was brought up...&quot;, &quot;...it was special back then...&quot;, &quot;...I pulled myself up from my bootstraps...&quot;, &quot;...I guess this generation doesn't have those values anymore...&quot;, &quot;...we had the war to define us...&quot;. Enough. It becomes like a lawn mower with a stuck throttle.I don't want to take laurels from those folks in the &quot;greatest generation&quot; but this is too much. I read Andy Rooney's, &quot;My War&quot;. Andy is unpretnetuous and his book gives you a feel what it was like to live back then without being heavy handed or pretentuous. Rooney's chapter in Brokaw's book hits what bothers me about &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. The &quot;greatest generation&quot; had the fortune of a great depression to humble, and a world war to steel them. The war gave them the opportunity to see the world, and its horrors. It gave them a cruicible to rapidly mature. And because they happened to be born on the winning side, they got to enjoy the riches of the victory in America. Yes, they were special, only because that's they happened to be born during such an interesting time. Who is to say my children could not do the same? Other generations have made great marks (the folks who fought the civil war and then reconstructed America come to mind), but where is the brass band for them? Basically Rooney says today's generation is no worse compared to his. He is right.If you take &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; as a compilation of uplifting stories from everyday individuals it makes a nice book. But, that is not what's going on here. At the end of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; I can only hear &quot;Looky at us yuppies, twenty-somethings, whipper snappers, we're great and you're not!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This was the first book my wife gave me about the war. It started me thinking of all I went through when I was in the war. As an introduction to the generations who weren't there, I think this was super. For us who were there, I am glad to see it documented in such a manner. Thank you for writing this book!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Filled with humorous, sad, and inspirational stories about the people who came of age in the 30's and 40's and who are slowly fading away now into our memories. This book should be a must read in every high school government class."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It is rather disingenous for Tom Brokaw to suggest that he is addressing a neglected topic with his book. The men who fought in the Revolution, the Civil War, and WWII are already the most celebrated military heroes in American history.It is also disingenous to suggest that the soldiers who served in WWII were any better than those who fought in, say, the Civil War or WWI or Vietnam. Despite the gloss Brokaw puts on his account, war is an ugly, brutal, soul-destroying thing, not at all uplifting or romantic, except perhaps in terms of the camraderie among combat soldiers. All wars have their heroes and cowards, their brilliant victories and their demoralizing disasters.I once saw Tom Brokaw on a talkshow, promoting his book, and in response to a question from the host, he was forced to awkwardly and reluctantly suggest that the American GI in WWII was better than the American GI in Vietnam. He said this was due to &quot;bad training.&quot;Brokaw is obviously no military historian. I doubt that he could provide many specifics about those instances in WWII when badly-trained, badly-led U.S. units were mauled by veteran enemy troops (one thinks most readily of Kasserine Pass, New Guinea, and the behavior of certain American units at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge). I doubt also that Brokaw knows much about those instances in which well-trained, well-led U.S. units in Vietnam prevailed in the face of a tough and resolute foe like the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese (Ia Drang Valley, Operation Starlite, Howard's Hill, Hue City, Bloody Ridge, etc., etc., etc.).It is true that U.S. units in Vietnam became terribly demoralized and ineffective in the last years of the war, but that was less the result of some type of generational divide as it was to the political situation; when the U.S. began pulling out of Vietnam, those troops still on the ground saw no reason to be the last man killed in a war that the country was unable to win. There were, one might note, also plenty of demoralized and ineffective units in a &quot;good war&quot; like WWII.Tom Brokaw simply doesn't seem to realize that the average American GI has done a good job in all of our wars, from the Revolution to Somalia. That is not to say that those who won WWII do not deserve to be honored for their bravery and sacrifice---they obviously do---but it is to say that Brokaw should not by implication denigrate the bravery and sacrifice of men who fought in unpopular wars like Korea and Vietnam in order to celebrate his so-called Greatest Generation.It is true that this Greatest Generation was able to build an economy in this country in the post-war years that provided educational and career opportunities and a standard of living for its citizens that was unheard of in the history of the world. This Greatest Generation, however, was as unable as any other generation to mend the racial divide in America (one could argue that busing and affirmative action have only made the problem worse), and it provided dismal political leadership in Korea and Vietnam. One might also mention McCarthyism, voter fraud by JFK, and, last but not least, Nixon and Watergate.Brokaw's account is basically cheerleading, not history, and is so white-washed and sunny as to be unbearable. I've always wondered if Brokaw would have written this book if SAVING PRIVATE RYAN had not sparked such a surge in WWII nostalgia."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Colorless, poorly written collection of interviews with WWII vets held together by shaky thesis.The title refers of course to the Americans who fought WWII and prospered in post-war America. While taking nothing away from accomplishments, why are they the &quot;greatest generation?&quot; No generation of Americans has ever failed to answer the call to arms and perform in less than spectacular fashion. Are the Americans who fought the Germans and Japanese somehow superior to those who fought in WWI or Vietnam, or the Civil War? Did it take more courage to parachute into France than Vietnam?Let's not forget that the WWII generation also returned home at a time of unprecedented growth and oppurtunity. Not so for vets of other wars, especially vets of WWI and Vietnam.I suggest that anyone interested in books of this type try &quot;Citizen Soldiers,&quot; or &quot;D-day,&quot; by Stephen Ambrose, or any one of the scores of far superior books offering accounts of WWII vets."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw had as much to do with the writing of this book as King James I had in the writing of the King James Bible. This book is a classic case of writing by committee. Though the positive achievements of the World War Two generation are undeniable, given that they had a major hand in the defeat of Italy, Germany and Japan, the less positive achievements of the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; are not probed by Mr. Brokaw and company. The social welfare entitlements the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; voted themselves have been a great burden to future generations as the current high tax burdens can attest. Any attempt to lessen the burden of entitlements is usually crushed by the unusually selfish &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;. I can remember one of the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;, when informed by John Stoessel that he had put into Social Security three years worth of payments yet had received seventeen years worth of Social Security, ranting that he had earned it all and wouldn't put up with a reduction. This greedy, unfair little man is what the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; is also about, too. The hubris of this devoutly government-oriented generation was best magnified by the travesty and tragedy of Vietnam. The thought at the time was that the US government could do anything and certainly could defeat a communist insurgency in a land almost no American had ever heard of. Fifty-eight thousand Americans and a million Vietnamese were sacrificed on this high altar of &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; hubris. And don't forget that LBJ's Great Society was part of the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;'s hubris. It crashed much like the flaming Hindenberg and it's dire results remain with us still. This is a very flawed book that is certain to make millions for Mr. Brokaw and sooth the feelings of America's most overrated generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"While I know Brokaw is a newsman and journalist, too much of his linear style effects what are otherwise compelling stories of those who lived and fought for this country."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I couldn't even finish this book which says a lot because I hate not finishing what I've started. It's way to repetitive and one dimensional. The only part I really enjoyed of the book were the love stories. The rest were just the same thing over and over...guy joins the army, comes home and becomes a lawyer, politician, something of that sort. I have the utmost respect for that generation, but this book was lacking feeling..."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was inspired to read this book when my great uncle passed away at the age of 94. He was the type of person who exemplified the greatest generation by serving his country and then returning home to be shining light to all who knew him. In the first 100 pages of this book, the author Tom Brokaw, focuses on the stories of just such ordinary people and the stories are deeply meaningful. He tells us of the common people who put their lives on hold for the cause of freedom and were the ones who truly experienced the horrible realities of war. If the rest of the book had maintained this honest, reverent and plebian tone, it could have stood as a true testament to the greatest generation. Unfortunately, the last 3/4ths of this book does not. Instead, the author turns his attention to the elite class, to those that he most closely enjoys a collegial relationship with, directly attributable to his career in journalism and it's close ties to politics. I made it a point to notice how these elites often entered the war as officers, either because of their Ivy League education or privileged backgrounds. Reading these stories seemed to diminish the premise of the book. It was the ones like my great uncle who epitomized the greatest generation, not Arthur Schlesinger, Casper Weinburger and Andy Rooney."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book was an interesting colaboration of stories by Tom Brokaw. It takes place during World War 2 and touches on every subject for combat heroes overseas to heroes in America making supplies for those overseas. I really enjoyed this book even though some of the stories were a little slow and not action packed. Still they were writen with good insight to give you the feeling you actually know the person. There were many man and women who put their lives on the line for their country and they need to be remembered so that the youth of America will learn the lessons they are telling. Overall this was a good book with good explanations and descriptions even with the occasional story that I think should have been left out."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"In speaking with my Grandfather, and in my various trips to Archives II at College Park, I've come to have a better understanding of what &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; means.The stories within these pages not only reflect a time of war, but a time of morality, freedom and those who felt an obligation or calling to fight for those ideals. My Grandfather is one such man.Joseph A. Dean of the 1268 Combat Engineers may not have been in the thick of battle but his stories and life mirror those within these pages. I thank him and those that went to war along side him, because they took the terrible hand that was delt to them, and made it work. To those that have been offended by this work, I ask you to reflect on your life. The Generation spoke of in this book fought for your rights, and many gave up their lives so you could speak your mind. Isn't it time you use your mind for more than harsh words and sophomoric remarks?Thank you Mr. Brokaw, and thank you Pappa D.!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Terkel has been studying this generation for years,and has collected many of his stories in the aforementioned book.

They endured during the two greatest challenges this country has faced: The Great Depression, &amp; World War II. They didn't ask for it.

Tom Brokaw's book will help us to never forget them."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It may sound corny to some but the people described in this book represented the values of the majority in their time. It's only because of them and hundreds of thousands like them in the U.S and other countries, that Americans enjoy the riches and freedoms that we take for granted today. The book could have been large enough to fill up a good size library. However, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job of choosing a good cross-section of the country. I was impressed with his own insights to that time and got the feeling that his words were from the heart. As the son of a waist gunner on B-17's and POW who never spoke of the War until his last few years, I whole heartedly agree with the title of this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book has received a lot of attention and is selling well---but that's a testament to the power of the marketing machine that's been fired up behind it, not to the book itself. Search back articles from the Wall Street Journal if you want to read about how the marketing was done. You'll learn very little from reading the book itself, though."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is written in the same manner as the news is read on television, in little sound bites. There is not much &quot;meat&quot; in the brief stories included. Brokaw chose to include political correctness which made me wonder why he called it &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. He manages to tarnish that generation by judging historical events using today's values. Overall I thought the book rather boring."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a baby boomer of WWII, I enjoyed &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; very much. I even shared the book w/several Vets of WWII (men &amp; women), which they enjoyed it also. I would have shared it w/my father if he were alive today. I didn't realize the descrimination that went on; but I'm glad they 'stuck it out'."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was very excited to read this book, because I am very interested in the subject matter and was eager to read the stories of &quot;regular&quot; Americans who were involved in the war effort. Unfortunately, the treatment is so shallow that I didn't really learn anything I hadn't heard or read elsewhere. Brokaw's treatment of the stories are so glossed over and so short that they really don't convey a sense of what the people experienced. Particularly annoying was Brokaw's &quot;insights&quot; about fighting the war and the discrimination in Amarica. He continually repeats himself by pointing out the obvious conclusions that the reader should already have realized. Brokaw seems to think that he is the only one to realize what a sacrifice ordinary Americans made during the War and feels it necessary to point this out over and over and over again. If you want to read about ordinary experiences in WWII that are not glossed over, read Ambrose's D-Day or Citizen Soldiers."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"...especially if you know someone who was in WWII. I bought a copy for my father - a retired AF Colonel, who was in WWII. We had the distinct pleasure of meeting Tom Brokaw at the VFW in South Dakota in Nov. 1998 as he toured the country looking for vets whose stories he could share on his television special in Jan. 1999. If you could have seen the look in my father's eyes as he relived some of his best and worst memories. If only I could have had an autographed copy of the book. I will settle for a picture of my father and me as we talked with Tom about his days growing up in So Dakota and his love for the brave soldiers that worked so hard to maintain the freedoms for all of us. God Bless you all.....all of you who have ever been to battle. Only you can know it's horror. Our thanks is all we have to offer."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The greatest think about the greatest book about the people of the greatest generation and not simply the history of that generation is the admiration that Tom Brokaw carries for the people he writes about. He does not treat it as some sort of NBC project or assignment he was sent to do by producers. He talks about it as a person who is in admiration of the topic and is learning about these people with us. His learning process is our learning process. He wants to share it with us. The book clearly emphasizes Mr. Brokaw's journalistic intelligence and savvy, that when mixed, can only be described as ingenious."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"If there is one word which comes to mind as I read Brokaw's book it was the word &quot;character.&quot; What is lacking in our culture is character. It seems that character emerges from a culture which has experienced great hardship, deprivation, danger and the overcoming of great odds. Our generation (baby boomers) has had everything given to it. We expect it and feel that effort and challenge and hard work are unacceptable. As a result ours is a generation lacking &quot;character.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a touching book that touches the very core of what it is to be an American. It is something the people of younger generations should read to realize how good we have it and how the World War Two generation persevered and literally saved the world. This book is testimony to rugged individualism, morality, honor, and duty--and makes the reader realize how silly some of our &quot;beefs&quot; with world today really are. Like Stephen Ambrose, my hat is off to Tom Brokaw for putting together this superb collection about the Greatest Generation! Read it and tell someone from the World War Two how much you appreciate their sacrifice!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw does a wonderful job of highlighting the lives of the heroes he includes in the book. In an age where no one seems to be held responsible for their own actions, Brokaw shows the incredible commitment, bravery, and responsibility that the WWII soldiers (both men and women) showed during the war and in their lives after the war. The book is a valuable history lesson as well as a lesson for the future. You will want to make this book a permanent part of your library collection."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"At age 48 I often wondered how our country ever made it through the Great Depression and WWII to become such a great superpower. Many pundits and authors have offered various socilological and economic threories on this topic. Brokaw makes a simple but powerful statment - America is where it is today for one basic reason, our parents were tough, hard working and had a vision of the future they wanted for their children.I just wish my father was still alive today, so I could stop by his house, sit at the kithchen table and tell him that I now understand why he and mom sacrificed so much for us kids and harped on us constantly to get an education and succeed in life.Brokaw captures the energy and passsion of a generation that created the &quot;American Dream&quot; and we now face the task of preserving what they gave us for our children."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw -- anchor of the NBC Nightly News -- writes a great book! His reverence for &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; people born in the 1920's, is clear, compelling and powerful. With a strong base of historical insights and information, Brokaw builds a puissant argument: people born in the 1920's, who came to age during the depression, fought WWII in their twenties, came home and fostered the babie boomer generation and continued to become great and humble leaders (on whole, each in their own right) are members of the greatest generation that any society has ever produced. A great book for anyone interested in 1920+ history, stories of triumph (some of famous persons (eg. George Bush, Ben Bradlee, Andy Rooney) -- some not), and brillance."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw tells us of the everyday people who went to war and served their country. They return to build the United States as a superpower. This book captures the greatness of the generation and what we can learn from them. Duty, honor and hardwork has made this country great and makes me proud the accomplishments of my grandparents."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\" is a great book with many enthralling stories from World War II and it provides an excellent look at the generation that shaped the world as it is now. Kennedy was said to be the first president elected from this generation and George Bush was the last. Every president in between, with the exception of Jimmy Carter, were veterans of World War II and these presidents are considered some of the most influential of our time.Brokaw interviewed many affected by World War II and named them the \\"Greatest Generation.\\" Throughout the book, Brokaw gives examples of why the men and women of WWII are the Greatest Generation. Through all the trials that this generation had, they pulled together and made themselves stronger. The book covers the entire spectrum of the U.S. Population from the common everyday citizen to the rich and famous of today.The ordinary people he wrote about were just that, ordinary. The story of Thomas Broderick was very interesting. He was sitting in a foxhole trying to get a shot off, when he poked his head a little too far out. He was shot through temple and was blinded for the rest of his life. After extensive rehabilitation efforts, he went on to lead a normal life.Brokaw then went on to talk about those working on the home front, in factories and in scientific positions. He focuses on women working for the first time and the radical restructuring of the workplace that occurred afterward. Then Brokaw talked about three of the many heroes of the war. Two of the heroes had received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award available in the military. Bob Bush was a Navy corpsman and was at the battle of Okinawa. He went in to rescue a man down on a hill and kept plasma flowing into the injured soldier's body as numerous Japanese soldiers advanced on his position. He drew his revolver and fired until out of ammunition at which point he picked up a discarded carbine and managed to keep the enemy at bay until reinforcements arrived.Women were the focus of the next section of the book specifically women in uniform which was unheard of before the war. He described the experiences of many women in the WASPs (Women's Air Force Service Pilots), WACs (Women's Army Corps), and the Navy's WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service). He describes their trials with discrimination and the war in general. Though the war was a great experience for the U.S., it also holds much shame for the country. During the war, many people were discriminated against, women, blacks, and Japanese Americans. Most Japanese Americans were shipped off to the United States' equivalent of concentration camps where they received horrible treatment. At first they were not allowed to join the army then, after a petition was signed, Japanese Americans were allowed their own regiment and were placed in the worst combat situations. Of the Japanese Americans there were 8 Presidential Distinguished Unit Citations and 18,143 individual decorations including one Medal of Honor, 52 Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars and 28 Oak Leaf Clusters, 4,000 Bronze Stars and 1,200 Oak Leaf Clusters, and at least 9,486 Purple Hearts.Many famous people of our time were included in the book. George Bush, Andy Rooney, and Julia Child just to name a few. Many WWII veterans went into politics after they returned from the war. Several U.S. Senators and presidential advisers were interviewed for this book. In the end, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job persuading me that this was the \\"Greatest Generation\\".Tom Brokaw's eloquent language and excellent word choice augmented with clear and direct statements persuade the reader that these were the greatest generation that ever lived. He showed that through their morals and arduous struggles they made the greatest impact of any previous or subsequent generation. Brokaw has a way with words that most modern authors lack. He knows just how to word a phrase to make the greatest impact. Though many of the stories were gripping, others lacked the same effect. For the most part, I found the book fairly entertaining. This was such a great book that I think most of my friends and peers should read this book to gain a greater understanding of this spectacular generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"There is no doubting Tom Brokaw's sincerity and deep feelings of respect for the WWII generation. It comes through with comments such as the following:&gt; &quot;It is a generation of towering achievement and modest demeanor, a legacy of their formative years when they were participants in and witness to sacrifices of the highest order.&quot;&gt; &quot;It is a generation that, by and large, made no demands of homage from those who followed and prospered economically, politically, and culturally because of its sacrifices.&quot;&gt; &quot;There is a common theme of pride in all that they've accomplished for themselves, their families and their country, and so little clamor for attention, given all they've done.&quot;Agreed, endorsed, and fully appreciated by many of us. I'm no different with a father who ferried paratroops to Normandy in his C-47 &quot;vomit comet&quot; and made cargo hauls to Belgium after that, and a mother who worked in a naval ordinance factory in Glasgow, Scotland. Respect and admiration however is insufficient to get us through 50 fairly repetitive stories.I agree with Mr Brokaw when he says they were proud but &quot;they rarely discussed their experiences, even with each other&quot;; give him credit for getting so many stories out. The reality remains though that the war stories and experiences of our parent's generation may be of great interest to family, but as general readers, we will learn more and are better served by reading a collection of war letters or essays by good historians."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I will be the first to admit that Tom Brokaw has a place in my heart and in that of most of America. Unfortunately however, his book does not. Though it offers a much deserved tribute to a great generation- and perhaps a much more important lesson to the youth of today- it was at many points a tedious and dull read.Conceptually it was interesting. Breaking it down into life synopsis' of those who were there was brilliant. However, they often read like a bad book report. &quot;Here are the facts of this peron's life. Done.&quot; James Bradley's 'Flags of our Fathers' will leave you feeling much more obliged to the Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A very moving and informative book. A friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed. After reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in WWII. This book helped me bring me closer to my father.This book is full of stories of WWII vets, what happened to them, and how it changed there life, and how they succeeded."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Well written, very informative, and very easy to get an up close and real personal feeling for the men and women warriors of WWII and the sacrifices they made to guarantee freedom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation is a wonderful collection of stories from men and women who served during the WWII, both on the front and at home. They come from all walks of life, big cites and small towns, black and white, rich and poor. With thousands of veterans pasting away everday, this book has given the men and women credit for preserving democracy and setforth the American morals and values. Many young men and women lost their lives for freedom I enjoy today, it's a shame some of the reviewers below criticize this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My father was a World War II veteran so I somewhat understood the hardships and sacrifices that his generation had to endure, though he made every effort to shield me from the terrible atrocities that occurred. Even so, I learned a lot by reading this book. I learned how simple people, both men and women of all races,creeds and colors were able to band together when our country needed it the most. Will this ever happen again? Maybe not in our lifetime, but it may happen in the future. After you are done reading this book, save it for your children to read. It will serve as a valuable history lesson to them and I would hope it could teach them something about patriotism, selfless sacrifice, and gratitude to all the people who have served in every war in order to preserve our freedom and the American way of life."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Every American should read this book, it tells what duty, loyalty, love, honor, service and country are all about. Men and women died &amp; suffered to give Americans what they have today, its time to salute the flag again, not burn it. Be thankful for what we have and PROTECT IT, without young men &amp; women &amp; their courage that this book depicts, it could all be so easily lost."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw makes a good point, but it's delivered, in spots, rather tediously. There are better books out there about World War II, by professional historians, and by World War II participants (try BAT BOMB for a TOTALLY unique memoir of World War II. World War II buffs who don't know BAT BOMB, are like biblical scholars who don't know about Noah's Ark. And that is only a slight exaggeration.)"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a 19 year old college student I set out to understand the generation and some of the times my grandparents speak of today. This book gave insight to a period that was filed with great pride fo the United States of America. I now better understand the complex times of World War II and wish that all students my age had a chance to read this book. The level of respect that I have for those that lived during these complex times has risen to an unparalled high. Now, I wish that someone could write about my patents generation in such easy an easy to read journel so that I can understand the tenstion and complications that seperated this country to such and extent."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I had high hopes for this very worthwhile topic. Reads like Mr. Brokaw is presenting a report on the late news. I expected a more developed presentation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Americans reviewed EXTREMELY worthy--Just that there was no depth--more like a sound byte. And most of the stories came from American soldiers from the Midwest who were fighting in Europe. Hey,there were southerners, and there also was a PACIFIC War. Tom whom I adore and admire can do better than this!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was only 10 at the time of Pearl Harbor but had a brother who served in the Navy - I have read a lot about WWII but I really appreciated the way Tom Brokaw pointed out the results of the depression having such an effect on these people also. I was born during the depression but grew up in the after-effects that my parents carried with them to the end of their lives. It was a very precarious time. Thank you Mr Brokaw for putting all of this in such a readable book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw has written a decent book applauding the WWII generation for their undeniable achievements, integrity, and character (although this has been going on literally non-stop practically since the day the Big War ended, despite the preposterous claim of one of Amazon's reviewers that &quot;it's about time&quot; this generation was appreciated). But &quot;greatest generation?&quot; Compared to whom? Greater than the giants at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century who fought for, defined, and created this country? Greater than the Civil War generation that endured over 600,000 deaths in order to ensure that the nation would continue and that slavery would be ended? Greater than the generation of Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Marshall, MacArthur, and Nimitz who led Brokaw's &quot;greatest generation&quot; to victory in WWII?And as for the much-maligned Baby Boom generation: if the Boomers are such relative slackers, what does that tell you about the parenting skills of their parents, who were, after all, the very same members of Brokaw's &quot;greatest generation.&quot; And, of course, that &quot;greatest generation&quot; includes the same mental giants who sent the Boomers to Southeast Asia for so long.A far, far better history of the WWII generation is Steve Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers.&quot; Ambrose captures the same undeniable virtues, but with vastly more perspective and an absence of hype."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I doubt that Mr. Brokaw will see this review.I bought the book but have not read it because I cannot get past the title.I am 85.I was a 20 year old, 128# kid out of North Dakota when I joined the Air Corps, the United States Army Air Force in 1942 and after an excellent training I went over to the Mediterrean and flew 94 missions in three different airplanes. I was one of 17 that came back of the 45 that went over.I do NOT agree that we were \\"The Greatest Generation\\". We were an \\"Ordinary Generation\\" faced with an \\"Extraordinary Problem\\". Yes, we rose to it.But the implication I get from his title is that the present generation would not and I repudiate that.

Instead of the \\"Big Movers\\" picture, this movement looks into the actual \\"little people\\" who make up the bulk of those involved in history giving one an idea of life in such times....However, this book does not live up to that ideal. Far from it, the short stories are just that, too short tales of hard times overcome and their participation in the War. Much is colored by Brokaw's political bias (glowing descriptions of his progressive heroes,a large percentage of those portrayed) and poor history (the old saw about FDR saving the nation rather then his actual fault at causing most of the Depression's problems...)There are likely better books out there on the subject, take the time and look as this will likely disappoint anyone truly wanting to learn about these times and the people involved"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"We have become accustomed to Brokaw telling us stories about heros, just in a different medium. In &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, he details why people of the WWII generation were considered the Greatest Generation. These are people who survived the hardships of the depression, fought with honor for our country, and then returned home to leave productive lives while dissementating values to future generations.What touched me the most about this book, was the patriotism the people profiled in the book demonstrated. Here were people, many of them volunteers, fighting for their country and against despotism. It gave me a deep appreciation of how great our country is, and how special the people who serve in our armed forces are."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw has performed commendably here, and his attempt to recognize the efforts of an entire generation is in its way ennobling, but it falls short in some ways. With the exception of a few long pieces the sketches are too sketchy and appear as if Brokaw were attempting to jump on a popular band wagon set in motion by efforts like Spielberg's &quot;Private Ryan,&quot; which he refers to in the work. It may not be possible to credit a generation for the greatness of an era, whatever that means. He makes it appear as though the major accomplishments of the era occurred as a result of the entire generation's unified efforts. It ain't necessarily so, Tom. Brokaw's weakness may be one endemic in his own profession; that is the weakness of the sound bite and the tendency to treat complex issues superficially. In other words the book suffers from the weaknesses inherent in the &quot;infotainment&quot; industry. Though it is no doubt sincere, it is not history. The treatment of men like Bush and Inouye and Dole is good, however. It is flattering to be placed in &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; His fine sketch of Andy Rooney perhaps gives us a clue to the weakness of the work as a whole. But better to have it than not to have it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am a veteran of WWII and was very disappointed in this book. It is totally devoid of emotion. Brokaw generates no real sympathy for his characters and the result is much like reading a dull history book filled with statistics. With the subject matter available he should have been able to bring many tears to the eyes of the reader. I suggest Brokaw read Flags of Our Fathers to discover what real writing is all about."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book will not go down in history as classic literature. However, the stories it relates are important for those of my generation (I was born in 1967) who really have no comprehension of what our fathers, uncles, and grandfathers (yes, and grandmothers too) were willing to give in order that we may continue to enjoy the freedoms that we have living in the United States.It brought a lump to my throat, and a great desire to say thanks -- to the millions of men and women I will never meet, but gave of themselves more deeply than can be imagined."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a World War Two buff, I was looking forward to this book. A strong case can be made that the men and women who grew up during the Depression and fought or helped with the war effort during World War 11 are The Greatest Generation in American History. The same point could be made for the European, Russian and Asian young adults of that era who not only fought in the war, but had to suffer the unimaginable horrors of invasion and occupation. So, the premise of the book is a good idea and I have no doubt about Tom Brokaw's sincerity in writing it (with the help of a team of researchers.) Good intentions don't yield good research, good thinking and good writing, however. The book lacks substance, and depth. Be prepared to wade through chapter after chapter of Readers Digest-like writing that gushes with sappy salutes and honey-dipped hyperbole. This isn't meant to at all demean the courage or accomplishments of the men and women who are the subjects of &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; It's just that the book would have been much better had more effort been put into the depth and detail of their stories, and less effort into Flag-waving rhetoric."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Not many books will change my perspective of the society. When I first pick up The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw, I was skeptical. However, I am proven wrong. I would definitely recommend this book to almost anyone (from age 0-99+) because of two reasons; one reason is one will learn a lot more about World War II from a perspective other than the textbook, and secondly is because one will have a lot more respect for the elder generation after reading this book. Tom Brokaw did a great job of keeping his readers' interest. But be warned, there is a few section in the book where the reading does seem very long. Overall I believe this book is well worth the time and effort.As I mentioned above, The Greatest Generation change my view on the war in two ways. Prior to reading this book, I look at all the soldiers from World War II as a whole instead of individuals. This book made me realized that every one of the soldiers have their own unique stories and personalities. After reading these stories, I feel like I know them more personally. I was deeply touched by the accomplishments of Daniel Inouye and the 442nd regimental Combat Team. I was deeply saddened by the treatment of others to minorities such as Colonel Mary Hallaren, Martha Settle Putney, and Nao Takasugi. I was again proud when Martha, Daniel, and Mary Hallaren prove their society wrong by conquering numerous obstacles while combating discrimination. By knowing their stories make me respect these people much more than I originally do. No longer with their moments pass because of time, their legacies, as Brokaw puts it, will \\"live in our heart forever.\\" These stories certainly are not something that I would find in a textbook.Despite its size, The Greatest Generation was a very fast read because it is fill with wonderful pictures and a smooth writing style. Tom Brokaw grabbed my attention during the first few stories because the stories are fresh and straightforward. I especially enjoy the surprises, and the strong human spirit in Charles O. Van Gorder's story with the human POW and Wesley Ko's story of determination to pay off his huge debt, these spirits are something that I no longer sense exist in today's society. However, The Greatest Generation does have its flaws. After reading so many chapters, I felt Brokaw follow the same format in ever story over and over again, making his writing style very tedious after a while. The chapter, Love Marriage and Commitment, was especially painful for me because I did not care a lot for the lovers, but it was still interesting. The last few stories was slow, however in the last section, The Arena, Brokaw picked up his pace again and weave together and present to me different sides of the politicians I knew, Bob Dole and Mark Hatfields. The Greatest Generation overall left a very good impression on me.The Greatest Generation is not the typical book I would read on my leisure since I am not a fan of non-fiction novels. I do not regret not reading it because it is very interesting. However, The Greatest Generation did leave a sour taste in my mouth because I wanted to know more about the characters and some of the stories are too short. Overall, I believe the The Greatest Generation is a book every student who is studying American History or American Government should read because it will help one understand the situation more. Reading this book is the closest one can get living in during World War II. I will give it an A-."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I looked forward with great anticipation to read this book. What I read instead was very disappointing, particularly from an author who has been a &quot;talking head&quot; in living rooms on NBC News for so many years. Indeed, the generation of which Brokaw wrote is great; &quot;the greatest&quot; perhaps. But I expected from the title a lot more than a loosely assembled annotation of a handful of people's lives. Some of those chosen were interesting, others were facinating, but WHY did Brokaw select the ones he did and not others??? Two issues annoyed me to no end, however. First, was the repetitious nature of the point Brokaw tried to make. After a few &quot;biographies&quot; it was easy to figure out that these people sacrificed and succeeded! I didn't need two dozen more to get the message! Second, military awards are NOT &quot;won&quot;!!! It is NOT a contest with the Medal of Honor, for example, being &quot;the prize&quot; for first place! I have a couple of Silver Stars and as many Purple Hearts which were AWARDED for actions. Believe me, I never would have entered &quot;the race&quot; if those were &quot;the prizes&quot; for &quot;winning&quot;. Please report the facts correctly Mr. Brokaw, using the correct vocabulary!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The American experience today seems, all too often, full of divisiveness and distrust. I've heard my elders complain that today's youth seem too self-absorbed and have it too soft. Hard work, sacrifice and personal responsibility seem to be forgotten values. Younger Americans wonder why their grandparents are so critical. If all members of my generation sat down and read Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, I wonder how much cross-generational strife would be cleared up in the process.The World War II generation was probably the greatest generation America has yet produced. They journeyed across the seas to defeat Germany and Japan. But the work they did in the war is only half of the story. When these veterans returned home they went to college on the GI Bill (a government program of such far-reaching success that not even the most ardent anti-government conservative can dispute that government does right), and rebuilt a Depression-ravaged America. They raised a new generation of Americans, and fought what President John F. Kennedy called &quot;the long twilight struggle&quot; between capitalism &amp; freedom, and communism &amp; repression that was the cold war.Anyone who reads Brokaw's book will come away with a profound sense of admiration for the sacrifices and hard work their elders made to fight the evil that threatened the free world over the last fifty years. &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; reads almost as a companion to &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;, Stephen Ambrose's first-rate look at the soldiers who went off to fight World War II. It is doubtful that anyone who reads either book will walk away disappointed."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Perhaps this book should be a text book in schools. There are many books on WWII and the times in the 1940s; but Tom's book gives a broader view of the people, the times, and the war. Since the founding fathers and the Civil war...there is no greater time to study our culture in America than these years and this generation.You get to read much of the information straight from the people themselves...and not just a glowing rendition of a romantic season in our history. The good, the bad, the pain, the rawness, the strength, the honor and dishonor, the saving of America and Europe by a great people. This is a well written REAL American account of a too much forgotten time in our history."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation doesn't recreate the overwhelming experience of WWII as well as War of the Rats or The Triumph &amp; the Glory, or other recent best-selling novels set during WWII, but it is pretty good at what it does--which is recounting in a straight forward fashion some of what that generation endured to win a war that had to be won."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book will teach you what Character and Honesty really are. You will see principles that many men were able to instill in their sons, just by living their lives and serving their country in time of war. Some of them parented their sons via letters, and never returned to see them as adults. However,those adults became men of integrity, because of the influence of their Dads' words and examples. It shows the principles of love and hard work to accomplish your goals, and trust in God to lead and direct your paths. It teaches us how to triumph against all odds, with pride and honor, and love our neighbor more than ourselves.I am proud to be an American of that generation. What has happened to our beloved country? Why have we allowed ungodly philosophies to creep into our children's minds via their textbooks, and pass ungodly laws that are a slap in the face and insults to God and our forefathers?May God give us back our heritage.Pearl Black"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's book has interesting information about individuals who came of age to fight in World War Two. But his premise that they are &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is wrong. If he had more knowledge of American History he would realize that EVERY generation, at least from the Revolution through World War Two, and, particularly, those that fought in the Civil War and in World War One, shared all of the characteristics that he attributes to the World War Two generation. This shouldn't detract from the stories he presents but a more accurate analysis would define how the generations that followed World War Two have changed from the preceding generations. That, it seems to me, is the point he is really trying to make."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Common men, doing uncommon things.This theme is sprinkled throughout Tom Brokaw's book &quot;The greatest generation&quot;. After reading it I realized why. Its twenty something Joe Sixpack at his best. The people portrayed in this collection of partial biographies show what the human spirit is capable of when faced with an overwhelming task. These men and women sacrificed for a common cause, the country was truly united.They display as much patriotism,unselfishness, and faith in God today as during World War II, if not more.The book is not only on the war and its hero's, there are stories of the struggle of women on the homefront taking jobs left vacant by men going to war. Also, the stories of African American soldiers fighting a battle on two fronts, one against Hitler the other against a racist military, are particularly compelling. Foot soldiers, medical troops, flying aces its all here in an extremely readable text. The stories are separated out so it can be picked up and read off and on at ones leisure. The likelyhood of putting it down too often is remote. As a twenty two-year-old college student, I am keenly interested in what my grandfather, a WWII veteran, might have been involved in. My grandfather, like most veterans in the book, does not furnish his past war experiences freely. I can read this book and discover what he and others of his generation, the &quot;greatest generation&quot;, endured."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am 33 yrs old and I agree that this was the greatest generation. I think that the stories told in this book are very important. The sacrifice made was a great and unselfish one. Thank You for a great book Mr.Brokaw."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"So Tom Brokaw, Famous Television Celebrity, decided to write a book in praise of his parents and parents-in-law but decided to throw in dribs and drabs of other stuff as filler. The tragedy is that some of the subjects of his meandering and shallow skim through the WWII generation are probably worthy of an in-depth study by a fine writer--which Brokaw shows no indication of being.There were several times I cried out in anguished frustration at the trite and wooden phrases which Brokaw scatters throughout the book. What drove me even crazier (thank you, Harry Shearer) was imagining Brokaw saying them aloud with his slurred &quot;L&quot;s and salting in &quot;Tonight...&quot; after every fifth word. An egegious example of lameness from the book, page 27-28: &quot;...Van Gorder and his fellow doctors had set up an operating facility, a precursor to the MASH units, the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals that saved so many lives and, later on television, gave us so much intelligent entertainment.&quot; AAARGGHHH!!!I read this book because my WWII-era Mom recommended it. Sorry, Mom, there are a lot of great books about your era but this ain't one of them."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"&quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; has an admirable goal, but falls short due to the author's heavy-handed attempts to hammer his point in.Tom Brokaw correctly recognizes the World War II era generation as one deserving of our gratitude and praise, and his approach to this subject is commendable. Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary. However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves. He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation. If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's &quot;The Good War.&quot; Terkel demonstrates the incredible sacrifice and dedication of the WWII generation by picking a gamut of participants and lets their stories convince us that this was indeed a generation of heroes."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw tells the story of forty-seven men and women who grew up during the depression of the 1930's, answered their country's call to war during the early 1940's and then used their post-depression, post-war drive and ambition to build a booming economy in the United States. Based on the personal sacrifices and successes of these forty-seven people, Mr. Brokaw concludes the whole generation of the 1930's and 1940's sacrificed and accomplished more in terms of victory at war and economic prosperity than any previous or current generation. Mr. Brokaw's single-minded and unrestricted praise for the &quot;greatest generation&quot; created a growing resentment as I read the book. He ignores the scoundrels infesting the &quot;greatest generation&quot; as well as the sacrifices and accomplishments of previous and subsequent generations. Studs Terkel, in his book &quot;The Good War,&quot; presents a far more balanced insight in the 1930's/1940's generation. Mr. Terkel identifies and talked to the heros as well as the scoundrels and slime balls who saw World War II as a money making machine and an opportunity for a continuous party away from the responsibility of home. Remember the English concept of the &quot;greatest generation&quot; was over-paid, over-sexed and over-here.As biographical &quot;snipets&quot;, the stories told by Mr. Brokaw were interesting. As for his thesis putting forward this group as the &quot;greatest generation&quot;, it is narrow and short sighted. Ask the generations who had to fight the Cival War, WWI, Korea and Vietnam about sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The book I purchased was a Christmas Gift so of course, I expected it to be in great condition to present to someone else and was very satisfied that it was in excellent condition when received.

Books are received in great condition, whether new or used, and very quickly! I will make Amazon my choice for oedering books from now on! Thanks again, Amazon!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I haven't personally read this book, but when first published, it received some great reviews. I have bought it for my Dad in the UK; he has read so many books on WWII, but always from the English prospective. I thought he would find it interesting to read about the war from an American point of view."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A little bit of fluff. Superficial. Shallow"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Redunencies throughout, scant attention to fact, e.g., no mention that WAAC (Women's Auxilliary Army Corps) preceded WAC; no mention of Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby, the first commander. And was the woman mentioned Wonda or Wanda? I left my copy elsewhere, hence I can't pinpoint chapter."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I just finished reading &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; and I will honestly say that it is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Rarely have I been so put-off by a book. I take nothing away from the experience and hardhships of the generation of Americans who suffered the depression and WWII. That surely is a 5-Star story and my parents lived it. But this book is not that story. Instead I find cliche's and stereotypes. For sure, the last 50 years of American history has been one of accomplishment and success. But it is easy to forget that this was largely because the rest of the industrial world was in rubble after the War, and America had a special opportunity to excel and grow. - - I feel alarm bells when any group of people are described as special or superior. This type of thinking has resulted in too much suffering in our world. I suspect the reality is that Brokaw is laying the groundwork for a political career. Is 'The Greatest Generation' the modern 'Profiles in Courage?.'"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Unfortunately, I decided to start reading first the Famous People section and The Arena section. Mr. Brokaw can barely speak kindly of Republicans! George Bush is described as someone who is inarticulate about his war experiences. Much more was written about Chesterfield Smith who started the independent counsel to investigate Nixon. Of course now, the independent counsel &quot;has created a incentive for zealortry.&quot; Mark Hatfield is spoken of glowingly, but it is clear at the end of his story it was because he is not part of the &quot;newer Republican senators, with their strict conservative dogmas.&quot; Bob Dole is depicted as someone rather harsh, but since he is quoted with a joke against Nixon, he gets good coverage. Caspar Weinberger is linked with Iran-contra, but the country was &quot;already anticpating the arrival of a new, young president, Bill Clinton.&quot; Liberals are intellectuals, and the segration and the hatred for African Americans in the South is depicted as a religious conservative way, not the entire South's way. He could only quote hatred from an Espicopalian minister's wife. Nothing bad about Kennedy or Johnson years, only Nixon, Reagan, and Bush years. This book should come with a warning label, that although the media is supposed to give us unbiased reporting, Mr. Brokaw's bias against anyone who thinks other than liberal Democrat is to be ridiculed or vilified. I'm very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw minimizes every other generation of people in this century and thousands before...I am a lover of history and consider myself well read in many areas of world and US history. There have been many great generations of people and many great people who have led generations. Fighting a war is nothing new in this world. Thousands upon thousands before this generation have suffered in wars; it is only now, because of our vast system of media, that we have first-hand accounts of war and of communities ravaged by war. Every generation has its' burdens, peculiarities, and identities. I am a baby boomer..born post-war..and I grew up in a lower middle class home, had to work after school and on weekends, never owned a car till I was in my thirties, earned my way through college and graduate school, paid back every loan with high interest rates, have struggled to make a living and deal daily with the myriad of stresses that cloud everyday life. My father was in the Navy in WWII in the Pacific arena and I knew about the war, its' atrocities and the horror long before 'Saving Private Ryan', Steven Ambrose and Mr. Brokaw hit the scene. I have all the compassion in the world for the men who fought in that war and every other one, but if Mr. Brokaw and others think that my generation hasn't faced death, despair, fear, illness and poverty, he and they are not truly connected to the world in which they live now. I suspect in another 20 years, some wealthy boomer will write a similar book......"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"America how it should be. All liberal idiots should be required to read this to understand patriotism."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the &quot;greatest generation&quot;, killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"What is so special about this book? I am a baby boomer that has always respected the sacrifices that the WWII generation had to endure both oversees and at home. Do I need Tom Brokaw to reinforce this? Please! I stopped about half way through; to me it was 200 pages of senior citizen complaints about the younger generations."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"and now that I've read it I still think so. He's preachy and full of himself. Stick with Ambrose for the real thing."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I purchased this CD for a college assignment on the war generation. I picked a perfect book. Tom Brokaw truly captures an entire generation with detailed accounts of their heroic challenges they faced. I believe that the only downfall to this book is Tom Brokaw's voice. As nice as it sound on TV doing the news, it seems to be a bit monotone. It started to drive me nuts several times while listening. I guess that's why I chose to purchase the book on CD so I could just stop it at any time and then pick it back up an hour or two later. Overall, it is well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My Uncles were B-17 pilots in the War. Both heroes to their families. This book is a wonderful way to gain an understanding of the sacrifice each gave in their own way. I only wish it was longer! God bless the families of those who gave their lives for our freedom!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw has written a decent book about a generation of Americans worthy of accolades. But &quot;the Greatest Generation?&quot; What century? What planet? In the 18th century, this lucky country had Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, and all the rest of what we now (appropriately) reverently call the &quot;Founding Fathers.&quot; In the 19th century, over 600,000 Americans died putting an end to slavery and the fundamental schism within our country. And in the 20th century, we had the generation of leaders, including FDR and Ike and MacArthur and George Marshall, who led Brokaw's so-called &quot;greatest generation&quot; to what is, without question, the extraordinary accomplishment of defeating facism.This is not meant to denigrate WWII vets. On the contrary, they were great. But they followed in the footsteps of at least equally great men, and (one may hope) they will, in turn, be followed by great men.And, by the way, if this generation born in the 1920s was so great, how did they end up raising this &quot;boomer&quot; generation that is so regularly chastised? The boomers have got faults, as we've been reminded yet again at the very top of government, but didn't their folks -- the so-called &quot;greatest generation&quot; -- have something to do with raising them?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The stories of the people depicted in the book are interesting. Ranging from really interesting to somewhat interesting. These were people that made a difference and deserve our respect. However the book is poorly put together. It seems as if I am watching a TV show on paper. A poor end result. Would not recommend."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I agree with Mr. Brokaw on many points and he is correct in saying that this generation brought about change This generation passed innovative legislation. I don't agree that it's the greatest generation perhaps compared to recent generations; lest we forget the generation that fought the war of Independence or the Civil War. If we forget history we are doomed."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Having Grandparents who grew up within this generation of people, I thought I had a good perspective of their lives. Roaring Twenties, then the Depression, then the war and Ration Stamps and then the prosperity to follow the war. Inside each chapter I could find similarities as well as contrasts to my grandparents' lives.This book is so easy to read and each chapter shows an angle that I had not thought about before. African-American, Native-American, rich, poor, male, female... the different perspectives make this book complete. Tom Brokaw did an excellent job interviewing so many different people.I feel that this book should be required reading for high-schoolers in U.S. History classes. I know it gave me a renewed appreciation for all that The Greatest Generation did to make my world a better place."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw knows better than his &quot;admiring&quot; comments about U.S veterans. he is giving too much credit to American WWII veterans. Other than raising his &quot;good old american image&quot;, I see no point in praising a nation that only profitted from WWII. Brokaw should spend his time on other journalistic adventures, and stop being a hedonist."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It amazes me that this book remained atop the best seller list for so long. There was absolutely nothing in this book which has not been covered, in a far more descriptive style, by a host of authors. This book did not have another authors help, and by god it needed it!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"\\"I am the Greatest!\\"Brilliantly, the book was written showing extreme sacrifices and valor of one of the greatest generations to live. The book showed how they survived economic and military attack. The book showed they built the world into what it is. Is that a blind construction? What about the world the way it is?The question, then, is about The Blind Generation. Were the trials of the 1930s and 1940s a time of blindness? Were people's eyes shut to destruction? Was the bomb the symbol of the generation? One could wonder if that is the way to live or were the protests against war of the 1960s the right way to live? It could be that neither or both generations were blind. Which shall it be? Perhaps the 1960s generation is blind and war is the right way to live, then perhaps not.Eric J. Lindblom PhD"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I have always found it insulting when the \\"WWII generation\\" is referred to as the \\"greatest generation\\" when in fact thay were nothing more than ordinary men and women that went through difficult times and rose to the occasion. That's it. How are they any different than the countless Americans who have done exactly the same thing throughout American history?Anyone who thinks that any other American generation wouldn't have or couldn't have risen to the same challenges is too stupid to understand the real meaning of the American Spirit. Brokaw is just one of these stupid morons who couldn't possibly begin to understand this truth about Americans.For those of you that lived through those times, good for you, you did a fine job for yourselves. You basically ran the economy into the ground, you spread socialism throughout the economy and gave govt. control over our lives, then you handed the Soviets eastern Europe and handed China over to the communists, and locked up innocent Americans into concentration camps just because they were Japanese-Americans or Italian-Americans. You must be very proud of yourselves.You elected Roosevelt to four terms even though the guy flooded the govt. with communists, wrecked the economy with socialistic programs, and kept information about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor away from the commanders at Pearl Harbor thus leading to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of American soldiers and sailors. Then, Roosevelt orders the incarceration of thousands of Americans simply because of their ancestry!! This is an outrage for which Roosevelt and his fans have never apologized. ...But it doesn't end there. Now, you are the same people who have strangled social security and have squeezed every cent out of it refusing to allow a restructuring of it so that it can be saved for future generations. Quite a legacy you leave behind.Yeah, quite a generation. Because of you and your \\"great generation\\" we have to deal with 50 years of a Cold War debt and greater govt. control of our lives. Thanks, but no thanks.You want to see great Americans? Take a look at our Founding Fathers who gave everything they had to establish this nation. Or, take a look at the Fireman who went into the World Trade Towers knowing is was a suicide mission. Being an American is not about a generation but rather it's an ideal, a spirit, a dream, and a way of life. Any American who possesses those virtues is part of the \\"Greatest Generation.\\" And those virtues are not relegated to some short time period in American history. They are timeless.This is what Brokaw and others of this myth fail to understand."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Although the subject matter is excellent, as are the stories, the editing is very poor. Editing in such a way as the tape ends in the middle of a story is uncalled for in this day and age.Brokaw needs to understand words beginning with an x are sounded as if starting with a z. Thus, Xavier University is pronounced as &quot;Zavier&quot; and not &quot;Exavier.&quot; For a professional, this is simply unacceptable."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I cannot say that I have ever exprenced war. Yet what we as a younger generation have faced is very clearly a far cry from peace. This terrorisom against us as a country makes us just as good as those that contributed to the war efforts of WWII. I am taken aback as Brokaw decided that in his godly manor that his father, and his fathers friends were the numro uno. Every generation has its fair share of heros it is horrible to pinpoint one generation to this and cover up what really needed to be said, that we lost thousands of men and women to a cause that needed to be fought. But recent events change the outlook of WWII, September 11 has shown the world that we as a country not a generation are the greatest, WE as a country not singled out retired folks who did do a great job, but in the book it failed to show the real deal it glossed over too much."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is sooo one-sided ! Brokaw is just trying to cash in on that generation's need to pat itself on the back for a job NOT well done. This book should have also told of the people (most of them) who made this country a living HELL for Blacks,Gays,Immigrants, Jews, etc. Mr. Brokaw forgets that Blacks went war and died for this country at a time when this country thought of them as less than human, and in no way were they treated like humans. Yet they fought and died for an American dream they weren't even a part of. Think about that for a moment. I am appalled at Brokaw's one-sided view of the WWII Generation. These people were bigots, racists, mysogenists, homophobes, they were narrow-minded, and religious fanatics/zealots! If these people were the greatest generation, we can all just give up now ! He says in this book that they did not question anything, that it was a matter of loyalty to their country. Well to this I say, its because they were such a brainwashed, non-thinking generation, that they did whatever they were told just like a bunch of sheep being led to slaughter. They looked-down on individualism, and civil rights for ALL Americans. One reader stated that Brokaw is writing about a time when America was united. My response to that is, TOO BAD THEY WERE UNITED IN HATRED,and RELIGIOUS FANATICISM ! Thank God their time is up and the racism and bigotry that they cherished so is now dying.

When I bought The Greatest Generation I was looking forward to reading some priceless primary material. I was very disappointed. The men and women who lived through WWII do have unique qualities that are not seen in other generations, but does that mean they are the greatest? I think not. They made mistakes like every other generation. There was divorce, spousal abuse, fatherless children, STD's, double standards. I respect the men and women who fought this war on the home front and the war front a great deal, but are they truly the greatest? No generation was truly great, many were just very unique. As Americans we should honor that uniqueness, but we should not forget that each generation has made their share of mistakes."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"AP story below:Brokaw Backs American Flag Ban&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchorman Tom Brokaw, who's made a bundle off patriotic Americans who flocked to buy his World War II book, &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; said Monday that he doesn't like it when journalists wear American flag pins and ribbons on TV.&quot;I don't think a journalist ought to be wearing a flag, because it does seem to be, to me at least, a sign of solidarity toward whatever the government is doing, and that is not our role,&quot; he told Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism.According to Northwestern's school newspaper, Brokaw explained, &quot;I'm a patriot, and I think being a patriot means [to] love your country but think you can always improve it. And part of my role as a journalist is to ask questions and to examine the issues that will lead to some improvement of the country.&quot;Two weeks ago, Brokaw's NBC News colleague Tim Russert wore a flag pin during a widely seen interview with Vice President Dick Cheney. &quot;I may be a journalist, but I'm an American first,&quot; Russert said afterwards.Brokaw gave a thumbs-up to the flag ban when he was asked about reports that ABC News prohibits its on-air reporters from wearing flag paraphernalia, according to USA Today."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It's very ironic that the supposed greatest generation were not able to instill their sterling qualities in their own children - the much maligned baby boomers.

I saw Brokaw on the talk shows and had high hopes for The Greatest Generation. But the author's dry, uninspired writing style made reading more chore than pleasure. I soon found myself skimming.

The stories are compelling and diverse, However, Mr Brokaw's writing style is an abomination, His prose is dry. He does not trust the reader to be able to draw the significance or irony of the events descibed, rather he is compelled to tell the reader: &quot;This is significant. This is ironic.&quot; He holds the readers hand rather than setting them free to think about the lives and to appreciate their beauty. I think only bright pink highlighting of the sentences would have been more annoying. All and all, a great topic, great lives but an overbearing and boring presentation. Apparently, Mr. Brokaw is not content to be a reporter but feels it is necessary to be remedial reading instructor as well"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw has made the talk show rounds touting this book. He tells several excellent stories taken from the book. Turns out those were the BEST of the bunch. The rest are fairly boring. He spends too much time lecturing about the political incorrectness of the times. C'mon Tom, save the sermons and give us more heartwarming stories like the one on Art Buchwald."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation is pretty good, considering. I mean what can one really expect by way of literature from over paid, telegenic, media stars? I enjoyed the references to Howard Stern. Too bad Brokaw didn't give Stern his own chapter. The book reminded me of Getting To Howard: The Odyssey of an Obsessed Howard Stern Fan. Now that's a great book. Sort of like Tolstoy meets Dr. Seuss."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw has done a valuable service for those of us who did not actually live through those years of depression and war. The stories he was able to collect are a series of brilliant recollections by men and women who lived and worked in those tryng times. Reading them is valuable to any present day American, because doing so helps us to understand who we are, and why we are the way we are.Unfortunately, Mr. Brokaw's historical understanding is limited, despite his accomplishments in other fields, and his editorial comments should be accepted with caution."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's book is an evaluation of those he interviewed, much like the news he reports each night - detailed and personal. For those Marines who want a look at the same information, but just about the enlisted man of the Corps during that period, a comparable book is &quot;Gyrene&quot; written by Wilbur Jones, and published by White Mane Press."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It is not to take anything away from the incredible deeds of the WWII generation to say that had this book been written by anyone other than Brokaw it would not have been so welcomed.

Surely, these people deserve something better thought out than a group of short stories."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I found the idea of the book very interesting. Some of the chapters were very well written. For the most part however, it put me to sleep quite often. It wasn't the book I thought it would be.

I'm anxiously awaiting his review of the book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Although less journalistic and more tributary in nature, this book hearkens back to a time that people of my generation still yearn for; a diffuse monochrome tapestry of what was once an ideal and simpler time. Or was it? Certainly there was greater emphasis placed on drawing distinctions between right and wrong, good and evil; but it seems that my memory, not unlike this book, perhaps, suffers a bit from reflective glossing. It's unlikely that any soldier sprawled out face-first on a French beachhead was reminiscing fondly about how good his life had been to that point. But certainly the demarcation lines were more clearly illustrated...Hitler was a malevolent sociopath and Churchill, a divine leader. I just wished this book had fleshed-out more of those gray areas. In fact, I recently had the opportunity to read a story about our most recent war, the war on drugs, and was captured by the multiple hues of gray that speckled the author's canvas. The book, \\"C.I.A.: Cocaine In America,\\" was one of the most engrossing and moving stories it has been my displeasure to read. That's right, the zeitgeist of this tortuous tale of ambiguous ethics and diffuse government operations is such that it captures best what is so different about society today versus fifty years ago. I used the word displeasure not as a means of demonstrating my disdain for this book, but rather my discomfort for how modern-day heroes are treated both by our government and by the media as compared to that \\"Greatest Generation.\\" Read both of these books back-to-back and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"One short story follows another.

I see those older than me(I am 26), as a group of people yelling &quot;Not my fault!&quot; The baby boomers in my opinion never grew from being just that, babies. This book details the lives of people who to take responsibility for their actions. Living the American dream was worth fighting for, and was never achieved by suing someone. The only group I know I can trust as a whole(with a few exceptions) are those from the generation presented in this book. It is only for this group that America is the great nation that it is today."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Growing up in the 1960's, I was aware of the relatively short chronological separation from the war. This book puts into perspective the distinct character and moral values of an entire generation faced with an unbelievably daunting task. Their attitudes, and their desire to resume their lives without looking back, explains in part the next generation's inability to share their parents' experiences and to learn from them. This may explain why WWII always seemed longer ago than it actually was.As the child of a 'Depression Baby' I was reminded often of the need for thrift, the need for a secure job, and the need to plan for a 'rainy day'. While these guideposts are certainly valued, they can seem trite if one has never know real need and deprivation. This book allows us to share the experience and emotion of the WWII generation in a way that has not been possible before.It is perhaps especially effective in its message as baby-boomers assess their own lives at middle-age. One cannot help but wonder how we would measure up under the same challenges. Would we fare as well without having first endured the Depression? Even if the need was clear, would we sacrifice for the common good?Reading this book allows anyone knowing a person from that generation, particularly a combat veteran, to have a greater understanding of that person's outlook on life. It allows us to understand these people in a new way, no matter how well we already believed that we knew them.Thank you Mr. Brokaw."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I listened to Imus for two weeks, and had to have this book. The I-Man should stick to politics and sports; book reviews are not his strength. I really liked the concept, and couldn't wait to read the book, particularly after having seen recent video interviews of WW II veterans, and Saving Private Ryan. About 25% into it, I had to take a break. There is nothing exciting or revealing here - just the very basic facts, folks - and that doesn't make for five stars. It really is too bad, because the premise was good, that is, telling the stories of the greatest generation. But it's all surface; there's no depth, and, therefore, no interest in the people whose stories are being told. Sorry Tom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a student of World War Two, and the son and nephew of servicemen in that conflict,I eagerly awaited this book.What I got was the same shallow, one-dimensional and incomplete story that Brokaw(and the others)present day after day on the News.In his book, Brokaw focuses unfairly on only a small segment of this wonderful generation--those that have made it big financially and by reputation.I quickly found the book to contain a rather elitist cast that did not resonate with me.And, as is the style these days, Brokaw focused only on &quot;Ike's Boys&quot; which is the same complaint I have with Stephen Ambrose:that many Americans volunteered for the military and were drafted during the Depression to ease the pain of family hardships, and wound up suffering and dying in places like Pearl Harbor, Bataan, Corregidor and Iwo Jima. Why did he choose to ignore these brave and selfless young Americans? They endured even more ghastly torment!Also, if you look at the demographics, many people came from cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco--yet the author chose to ignore the sacrifice these people made as well.I found the chapter heading narratives to be very superficial and almost repetitious.There are much better writers like Toland, Manchester,Weinstein or Halberstam who would do justice to the topic.I am sorry to say that this book does not do justice to what indeed has been &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw and I are about 5 years apart - he remembers the war times, I don't. What I do remember is the commitment and dedication to church, family and work that set the example by which I live today. Brokaw doesn't write like a journalist in this book, he writes as an observer and a participant, as well as the gatherer of the stories, some of which are familiar, some are new and surprising; all are welcome."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's book provides us with a reminder of how important the World War II generation is to our history. His glimpses into the lives of WWII vets and Americans on the homefront offer a touching insite into the era and a patriotic sentiment that seems lacking today. Well worth the time to read and remember the price many of our grandparents and parents paid to preserve democracy and freedom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I have read Tom's book which I believe is the best, and most inspiring book I've ever taken the time to read. Any of the people who might have said that this book is shallow and lousy must be shallow and lousy themselves. I believe we as a nation HAVE forgotten in a large way the WWII vets who gave their lives and risked their lives so that the generations after them could live in a comfortable country, full of opportunity. They experienced the worst conditions this country had ever seen, and complained the least of any generation there has been. I am inspired and grateful for their sacrifice and modesty. I SUGGEST THAT EVERYONE THAT MAY HAVE THE CHANCE TO READ THIS BOOK, SINCERELY READ IT!! IT IS VERY, VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw has complosed short biographies of men and women who served in various ways in WWII, ways for which they should be honored. Their contributions in the war were given short shrift and no story is given the depth deserved. The book does serve a purpose, however, by reminding us that we are still living among heroes."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"So I purchased this book for my about to be 80-year old father, who did his tour of duty in Normandy, and elsewhere. It's this veteran's opinion that will count -- but I kept wishing that the book had been written and had the voice of Walter Cronkite whose chronicles of WWII were an indelible memory and part of my childhood. I bet even Tom Brokaw would nod &quot;yes&quot; in agreement to that...."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As my father noted, (he's a WW II veteran of the Third Division who was in Africa, Italy and France), no mention was made in the book of the Third Division, which had more casualties, saw more combat and won more Congressional Medals of Honor than the Big Red. This is a glaring omission, which Mr. Brokaw should correct in the next edition. Please forward this critique to Mr. Brokaw. Many thanks."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I read this book and finally began to understand all the things that my dad would never talk about concerning the war. The stories are well written and thought provoking. The very fact that these people came home and did their best to be good citizens and make good lives without complaining speaks volumes about that generation. Now we saw soldiers crying about having to leave their families during Desert Storm. Do we think it was any easier for the generation during WWII? This book shows us how &quot;me centered&quot; we are. Another thing, now soldiers came back from the Viet Nam or Desert Storm wars and blame everything on their military experience. The WWII generation sucked it up and went on with their lives. They got over it. Makes me sort of ashamed of the way my generation deals with life experiences."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Just in time, you might say, Tom Brokaw has produced the perfect bathroom reader for the older generation. A collection of short takes on individual lives that started out in WWII and went well from there, one can sit and read until drowned in sugar. The message is clear: this is the generation that fought the war, came home heroes, set up shop and became successful at everything. Available in large print and on cassette, it is targeted for the generation that, having putatively done it all, now want to sit and admire themselves.I would like to offer a modest corrective: this is the generation that brought us fallout shelters, fast food, theme parks, the Vietnam war--just a little one for the kids?--and the edsel. Furthermore, as the saying goes, they don't get it: They don't get it about ecology; they don't get it about population control; they don't get it about gays in the military; they don't get it about the importance of innercity kids, they don't get bluejeans, t-shirts, or the Rolling Stones. I am glad these people had good lives, of course, but I came a little later (1945) and I live in a different world from them. I can't wait for the day when I am no longer expected to vote for a WWII hero for President. We don't have to worry about Brokaw's book: it will reach its constuentcy and they will keep it handy. If they wanted to sell it to me, it would be on a CD."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw (and a squadron of 'helpers') produced a bombastic, windy book that is a disservice to the superb stories that he is trying to tell.The book is at its best when Brokaw lets the individuals tell their own stories, with a minimum of his commentary intruding. The peoples' stories are poignant, vivid, and worth reading.The problem is, you have to wade through Brokaw's creaking prose to get to the good stuff. Hackneyed phrases loaded with superfluous adjectives may sound OK when read in Tom's distinctive voice - but they do not read well.So - kudos to Tom on getting people to tell the stories. Rotten job of trying to package them."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"would be one way to describe Tom Browkaw's collection of stories about the lives of a generation that have been underappreciated. Another way to characterize his book, however, would be to say that after reading it, we should all have a better understanding of why Memorial Day is a holiday. The lives that Brokaw chronicles for us are a microcosm of a generation that shaped the world in the 20th century. As someone who had a very limited understanding of WWII, I now feel that I have more knowledge of the sacrifices countless men and women made. The book was especially useful for giving parents some diverse examples human responses to adversity. Browkaw did an excellent job at making the spector of war become more personal for us all."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was really reluctant to read this book, I thought it was going to just focus on WWII and be all about the war. I was so wrong. While it did give me a much more powerful understanding of this time in history, I was also inspired by the stories of men and women who have made really significant contributions to our society."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"For gripping stories of WWII, read &quot;D-Day,&quot; by Stephen Ambrose. These &quot;up close and personal&quot; stories grew monotonous. Most significantly, Brokaw gave short shrift to the sins of this &quot;greatest&quot; of generations. While I appreciated the discussion of our nation's treatment of Japanese-Americans during the war, full treatment of this generation's rampant racism, sexism and post-WWII national arrogance was missing."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am very blessed. I still have parents and many aunts and uncles who are alive and healthy and well into their eighties. This is the generation Tom Brokaw writes about. It is also a generation that does not like to talk about the past. Mr. Brokaw has given us a gift by sharing these stories. I question; however, his question: Are their children, our generation, worthy as their beneficiaries? &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; had a common goal to rally around, and many shared customs and values. They also had a &quot;burning platform&quot; to fight for. Our generation has made much more progress to benefit society, created vast improvements in knowledge, technology and peace without the burning platform. Both generations are to be praised, for they both succeeded beyond all odds in very different ways. I ask Mr. Brokaw's question for our children and hope that the answer is the same. There is reason to hope, for the &quot;stalls&quot; that impede progress and do not build character are being challenged more each day. A inspiring book I just read, &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot;, describes these stalls and a process to move beyond the stalls to achieve 20 times the benefits, do so 20 times as fast, or at 1/20th the cost. Here are a few of the stalls we face: The Communications Stall (our messages are not understood), The Disbelief Stall (We can't do it), The Tradition Stall (We've always done it this way), The Bureaucratic Stall (too many unproductive policies and procedures), The Misconception Stall (based on poor assumptions) and The Unattractiveness Stall (Not wanting to wade in murky waters). Surely, this generation has challenges to face, vast opportunities, and &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; who gave us the role model to follow."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's left wing views and hero worship of high level Democrats is as obvious here as they are on the NBC news. Full of promise? Yes. Dull? Yes. Much thought for the 'common man' that fought WWII? No. If you were not a politician, a bigwig of some kind, or from South Dakota, forget it. My father was a WWII veteran and a POW. He came back to work a regular job and raise a regular family. Neither him nor his &quot;twin' showed up here. If the talking head had really done some true research instead of glorifying all of his buddies, it could have been an very good book. The only point he made, to ad nauseum, was that it was a generation of hard-working, religious, and family-oriented people. His atttempt to try to judge their actions by todays overly politically correct standards did all of them a real disservice. We did not have Butterball Kennedy to tell them how to act back them. If he asked any of them what they thought of his buddy Slick Willie, he sure did not let us in on their answers. One can only wonder why. After all, what would you expect those common folk to think of a draft dodging, womanizing, pathological liar. Brokaw's next book should be &quot;the Greatest American ever&quot; about his boy Clinton. No, really he needs to go back to being a talking head and stay there."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"'the greatest generation'? well, one might agree, if one discounts the segregation, racism, sexual repression, disrespect of women, narrow-mindedness, anti-communist hysteria, and all the negatives of which the farmboy beltway elitist slick newsreading frontman of General Electric's flagship was all too aware before his ghostwriter put finger to word processor.mr. brokaw's apologies, and the copublication of a LARGE PRINT version for the elderly make nbc's cynical and commercial intentions all too clear. not since a ghostwriter penned jessica savitch's 'newswoman' has a more cynical tome been unleashed by the nbc newsguards.mr brokaw is most obviously cashing in on the success of spielberg's &quot;private ryan&quot;... the fact that he has no military service record and as nbc's chief newsreader made no protest of president reagan's tribute at bitburg make his intentions all too clear.besides, the five hundred pages of this book are a long rehash of the same story, similar to dan rather's writer penning an op-ed in the times under gunga dan's byline.does anyone believe this man actually researched and wrote this book?this is a scandal! and a boring one to boot! this is one of the saddest successes of the millennial festival.perhaps it would have made a yawnable one page readers digest story.additionally... one would caution buyers of the audioversion of this book, since the author cannot pronounce his &quot;l's&quot; or &quot;r's."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"'the greatest generation'? well, one might agree, if one discounts the segregation, racism, sexual repression, disrespect of women, narrow-mindedness, anti-communist hysteria, and all the negatives of which the farmboy beltway elitist slick newsreading frontman of General Electric's flagship was all too aware before his ghostwriter put finger to word processor.mr. brokaw's apologies, and the copublication of a LARGE PRINT version for the elderly make nbc's cynical and commercial intentions all too clear. not since a ghostwriter penned jessica savitch's 'newswoman' has a more cynical tome been unleashed by the nbc newsguards.mr brokaw is most obviously cashing in on the success of spielberg's &quot;private ryan&quot;... the fact that he has no military service record and as nbc's chief newsreader made no protest of president reagan's tribute at bitburg make his intentions all too clear.besides, the five hundred pages of this book are a long rehash of the same story, similar to dan rather's writer penning an op-ed in the times under gunga dan's byline.does anyone believe this man actually researched and wrote this book?this is a scandal! and a boring one to boot! this is one of the saddest successes of the millennial festival.perhaps it would have made a yawnable one page readers digest story.additionally... one would caution buyers of the audioversion of this book, since the author cannot pronounce his &quot;l's&quot; or &quot;r's."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"...from a media master. It should surprise no one that Brokaw venerates the generation that came of age during WWII. Holywood and all the good guys have been beating this drum for decades, now.As has been said by another reviewer, Mr. Brokaw interjects too much of himself in his stealth attack on every other American generation.The reader should remember that the WWII generation gave us Korea, Viet Nam, and made a haven for international communism by building up the Soviet Union and turning over to them all of Eastern Europe.Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; also ushered in the decline of American liberties for the present peculiar brand of socialism that today is the law of the land &quot;across the fruited plain.&quot;Having returned conquering heroes, Brokaw's fondly remembered generation would later turn their backs on another generation of veterans whose GI Bill was only a dim shadow of the GI Bill made available to those who served during WWII. Brokaw's good guys would even deny Viet Nam veterans membership access to the VFW until 1973,after more than 40,000 had died in Viet Nam.America's Greatest Generation? You left a few things out, Tom.

Disappointment followed. The title, on reflection, is hyperbolic: was this really the greatest generation in all history, or even American history? Greater than the Civil War or Founding Fathers' generations? The stories are well-written, and interesting. The whole is not as great as the sum of the parts, however. I came away with the impression that this was another 'last good war' book, and thus it covering old ground. -Lloyd A. Conway"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw, one of the New Left Elite of the Baby Boomer generation that did its level best, when its own &quot;call to arms&quot; came, to avoid any variety of military service, now finds it convenient to wrap himself in the glory of a very different generation, which never paused to count the cost to itself of service to its country.In a very few pages after the opening, Brokaw takes his first opportunity to deliver his first cheap shots at today's Republican Party; he doesn't miss a single chance thereafter.A paradox: Brokaw lauds the generation that won the war against fascism, yet he and his own generation, to include our own noble Commander-in-Chief, are precisely the ones who rebelled against the concepts of &quot;duty, honor and country&quot; their parents held so dear.This is a shallow work, and superficially written. Worse, it is a shameless pandering to the sentiments of a nation which has come only lately, through the excellent works of hard-working historians such as Steven Ambrose, and cinematography of the caliber of &quot;Private Ryan&quot;, to recognize the sacrifices of the men and women who gave their all, so that the self-absorbed yuppies of Brokaw's generation could take it all for granted.Do I know what I'm talking about? I hold two Silver Stars and two Purple Hearts; my father was an American OSS agent in Northern Europe; that generation was my guiding beacon. It's a shame that a hypocrite like Brokaw has sullied their aura by trying to ride the breaking crest of their now-diminishing wave.Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw does a commendable job of describing how the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; earned its name. For those who are interested in which generation is likely to be the next great one, I highly recommend a new book titled &quot;Millennials Rising&quot; by generational authors Neil Howe and Bill Strauss. They believe that in the cycle of generations, today's youngsters--the Millennials (born 1982 to the present)--will replace the G.I. generation as the next great generation. The Millennials are already reversing many of the negative social trends associated with the last generation of young adults, i.e. the Generation Xers."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a truly captivating book.

It should be required reading in classrooms all across this country.

Growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, you see a lot of waste and disregard for human beings. My generation has never been in a major war or anything close to resembling that of the Depression. We have all grown up in the &quot;Me&quot; generation and have had the pleasure of unbelieveable growth in our economy. At the same time we have regressed back to the days of the pre-1960s with &quot;Political Correctness&quot; - it has divided us more into groups instead of bringing us together as &quot;Americans&quot;.Today, we do not understand the meaning of suffering. If we get into trouble we go to the Gov't (Welfare, bankruptcy, unemployment insurance, etc.) No one takes responsiblity for their own actions, there is always an excuse. People seem to give up today and not fight - an example of that is shown by the high number of divorces. It is easier to give up. If we allow ourselves to stay in this downward spiral, we will end up like Russia. We are already starting to slip - China espionage.We need to take the ideals of this generation and develop our children to have the same morals, ethics, integrity or however you want to state it, as &quot;most&quot; of these people in this book. If we don't we will continue to regress as a society.This book taught me that we should not feel sorry for ourselves, we have to work hard and make things happen, and we have to help those who cannot help themselves.

I lived through the &quot;Blitz&quot; and had acquaintances killed and bombed out of their homes.

Whether the author doesn't know that the Nikkei (their spelling) is a stock exchange in Tokyo or his proofreaders didn't know that or whether they just didn't pay attention, or they just didn't care, is what makes it inexcusable. Then when they did try to correct it to Nisei later in the chapter, they still misspelled it. Do they know the term at all! Some readers may be able to accept such errors, but I'm not that tolerant. I'm not of Japanese descent but I consider that carelessness (or lack of knowledge, which is worse) rather insulting. Those incidents were overall detractors from what could have been a great story.

Mihailovich's Chetniks rescued over 500 American airmen downed over occupied Yugoslavia, the single largest rescue of American troops from behind enemy lines in our nation's history. Gen. Mihailovich received the Legion of Merit Award for this rescue. The award was recommended by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and approved by an Act of Congress on July 20, 1942, (sec. III, Bul. 40 WD, 1942) and Executive Order 9260, 29 October, 1942 (sec. I, Bul. 54, WD, 1942). It was presented posthumously to Mihailovich by President Harry S. Truman on March 29, 1948. The State Department kept that award secret for over 20 years and to this very day they still maintain possession of the medal refusing to pass it on to Mihailovich's heirs. Hundreds of Serbs lost their lives to save these American troops, one of those downed airmen was Maj. Richard L. Felman, a Jew from Tucson Arizona who told this writer, \\"How can we expect the government to level with the American&quot;~ people about the MIAs in Vietnam when they are still covering up the truth about the MIAs in WWII?\\" Serbs the recognition they deserve. Hundreds of Serbs gave their lives saving these American airmen. Major. Felmen told me of his own rescue in which an entire village of some 200 Serbian women and children were killed because they refused to reveal his hiding place with Mihailovic's Chetnik forces. He watched with binoculars from the opposite hill as German troops slaughtered these Serbian victims. He begged Mihailovich to give him up to the Germans but Mihailovich refused saying, \\"You are too&quot;~ important to the forces of peace and freedom.\\"&quot;~ It is quite clear that he believes the name \\"Serb\\" is synonymous with the word \\"Jap\\" in WWII.

How about comparing to the exponentially greater generation that had to manage though the American Revolution and a new constitutional government? Of course there are many other examples. The American WWII generation are no more great then any other. They are being well compensated for their sacrifices in the form of free money courtesy of the working person. We workers are forced to pay insane amounts into the ponzi schemes called Social Security and Medicare for which we will never see a dime or a minute of service.

This \\"Greatest Generation\\" lived with less and had lesser expectations, yet somehow seemed more unified and civil, and went on to build and enjoy the post-war boom that followed.

Some people debate whether calling them the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; is fair, one of them is Andy Rooney - I think his chapter in Brokaw's book is one of the best.It's also neat to see the &quot;than and now&quot; photos of the subjects."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw supports his thesis that the WWII generation was the greatest, by providing a great many mini-biographies. Taken as a whole it is an impressive set of accomplishments and stories and gives insight into the values and motivations for what this generation the &quot;greatest&quot;. But I found myself wanting more than just a few pages on each of these folks."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The book is favorably received by the children of the subject generation. Perhaps more should be told of the elderly mothers and fathers of WWII generation who made physically demanding sacrifices. Despite losing close family members, they took in married daughters and their children, rented rooms to soldiers (and their wives), worked long beyond middle age, and graciously gave up comforts due them to encourage and make the chaotic existence tolerable for the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I gave this book to my 81 year-old father, expecting him to enjoy the attention paid to his generation. His remarks, after he had read the book, included an observation that Mr. Brokaw highlighted only a small fraction of his generation. He wanted to know what happened to those that didn't make it, who went broke, who were fired right before retirement, who created the pollution nighmare, whose business practices of greed and avarice forced out legitimate competition, whose health was neglected by a system that provides healing primarily to those who can pay. He was curious about those who became incurably mentally ill, who fought in the war only to be haunted by &quot;shell shock&quot; for the rest of their lives, who were inarticulate, uneducated, simple people, betrayed by their ruthless politicians. In essence, Dad discovered that, by highlighting only the over-achievers, the cream of the crop, this book creates a mythical people with whom he had little familiarity. Perhaps by dint of his milieu in TV journalism, which notoriously overlooks subleties of all kinds, Mr. Brokaw is unable to realistically portray this group of people, who are, and were, as diverse as any other group in our nation. Noticing that Brokaw leaves little room for other generations to excel, Dad also wondered why other generations are not as great. Perhaps this book should be classified as fiction, or even mythology."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw is not a gifted writer. He wrote this book in the same dry and simple style as he uses with his TV audience. The book is completely stripped of romance and soul for the sake of the lowest common denominator. I have met many WW2 veterans who tell stories woven with romance and heartbreak that bring tears to your eyes. This is not represented in any of the 4 page biographies of these common place heroes. Pure non-fiction at its most uninspiring."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I had seen Mr. Brokaw with Tim Russert, talking of the book. I started crying. I knew &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; was a &quot;must read&quot;. It took forever to read the first 40 pages ( couldnt see thru the tears )I am a 49year old USMC Nam veteran. I thought I &quot;had gotten&quot; it.After reading &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, I now know I wasn't even close to &quot;getting&quot; it! My dad spent 18 months in Northern Italy. Whenever I asked, he would kinda smile and talk about the troop ship trip home! He then would tell me his brother had more time overseas than he had in the service, go talk to him! My uncle served 40+ months in the Pacific &amp; Aleutian Islands. 40 months overseas and my uncle would talk about a Fillipino he had befriended. My grandfather, who rode with Pershing and served in WW1 wouldnt/couldnt talk about it either!I now understand a little bit better! Mabe I am starting to &quot;get it&quot;. Tom Brokaw graphically relates uncommon valor &amp; values by common people! Americans who stood/stand up and took/take responsiblity by the horns. My gosh, where are todays heroes that do this ? This really isint a book about war, but an insight into the lives and the perseverance of a generation of Americans !What saddens me is that America will probablly never have another WWII era American as President. What saddens me even further, after reading this book, is the night and day difference between then and now. I do feel some kinship with the WWII generation, because this country don't owe me a thing ! I owe it everything! I owe them everything!My daughter recently put on a Christmas show at a Veterans hospital. She related that a WWII Medal of Honor winner was introduced, and the vets went nuts, saluting, cheering ! My daughter didn't quite understand. I had just finished &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;..I explained the vets reaction to the Medal Of Honor winner to her. My daughter now wants to read this book! You know what ? She'll &quot;get it&quot; too!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I don't read very many \\"True Life\\" books, and I don't watch The Nightly News with Tom Brokaw, but I read this book on the advice of my father and really enjoyed it. It reiterated again and again how truly fortunate we are today in large part due to the sacrifices and work ethic of this generation. At first I thought the stories would only be about the ones who came back but then was brought to tears with the first story about one of the many that did not come back and the impact on his widow. Tom Brokaw spares nothing; he talks about the horrible prejudice and inequality that occurred with the black troops and women.The book becomes somewhat disconnected when Tom Brokaw moves from \\"ordinary people\\" stories to celebrities. It is disjointed when in the middle of a story he starts using \\"I\\" and interjecting personal stories from his own history. But, in the entirety, an excellent book that you will want your teenagers to read to appreciate their grandparents' sacrifices.If you enjoyed this book, try Sing Me A Bawdy Song by Noema Ayers, it is one family's story around this time told in much greater depth."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I found the words to be very touching, giving the horrors of war an emotional touch. I was very impressed by this book and had a hard time putting the book down."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"If there were no constraints of time or volume, all the people of that Great Generation could have been biographed, Thanks to Mr, Brokaw for ehat he was able to gather and publish. To the thousands not mentioned, including my Father and Mother, and their siblings who were so willing to set aside their lives, I am grateful."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Long ago I learned that disappointment is often related to expectations. So it was withTom Brokaw's book,The Greatest Generation.There was never a problem in putting the book down in as much as &quot;The Book&quot; is a series of news bites each lasting from 30seconds to 5 minutes, with little depth,as most news bites are.I have no doubt that Mr. Brokaw was emotionaly moved when he went abroad to the 40th anniversary of WWII D-Day in 1984. His well meaning tribute to the vetrans of WWII,chronical a number of men and women with whom he had contact over some 15 years as a news analyst. Each vignette describes their war record,how they dealt with the immediate post war period and their accomplishments afterward. The men and women frequently attribute their success to self reliance and leadership skills they learned in the service.Societal changes related to Blacks and Women are woven through his &quot;portraits&quot;.The WWII vetrans later in life were certainly the generation that helped foster the changes and deserve credit. In general the book does begin to raise one's consciousness and honors the men and women who served in WWII."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It helps to read the experiences of those who served when my Dad did. He would never talk about it even tho he lived, and well, until 1984. He left his squadron booklet behind and the glory bars and medals but no stories as we're beginning to hear now. Our area in Southern MD had a recreation of the Guadalcanal landing last summer and it was helpful --- it made the few b&amp;w snapshots we have more understandable."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"When I first began reading this book, I couldn't put it down. However, the further I got into the book the chapters became less detailed and less well written. It seemed as though the author hurried through the last half of the book. Also in the latter chapters of the book, very little information is provided on the wartime experiences and much more is given on the postwar experiences. Although I would still recommend this book, the author would've had to provide more detail to convince me that this was the &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Being a WWII buff, when I heard about this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. However, shortly after reading the first few stories, I was deeply disappointed. I have utterly lost all respect for Mr. Brocaw's journalistic ability. The book is simplistic (written at about an 8th grade level), repetitive and boring. It feels more like an article from People Magazine than any sort of historical record or work of literature. Devoid of facts and details, it contains very little of anything else.The generation he is writing about deserves a better tribute than this. I suppose it is to be expected that a member of the info-tainment industry would write something with such little substance. I used to be a loyal viewer of NBC News, I think I'll switch that loyalty to Jim Lehrer and PBS."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw compiles and organizes amazing stories of valor, lose, hardships, and heroism which characterized the World War II veteranship. As a 21 year old U.S. Marine I draw pride from these accounts while pouring tears of sorrowful thanks for all those heroic boys and girls that answered the call of duty. &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is to me an inspiration to keep going and contribute by my service a smite of what has been contributed by those who came before me. Tom Brokaw put forth a must read for anyone whom conciders himself an American patriot."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I think this book is excellent. I am learning things that I never knew before. Like there were women pilots for the service during WWII, but here at home. I learned alot about discriminatory practices towards women that were acceptable at the time. My only regret, is that so many of the veterans are dying off or mentally unable to talk about their experiences. I work in a nursing home and the one veteran who is mentally fit, told me, &quot;It was too horrible to think about. I don't like to talk about it.&quot; The other vets have Alzheimers, or physical conditions that prohibit them from talking. But these men have so much to teach us about patriotism, and loyalty and honor. And I don't know if the young men and women of today have those traits...so many seem self centered and &quot;me&quot; only. I think it is a great book and recommend it to anyone who wants to know about the men who fought for our country during WWII."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book has about as much depth as a 30 second news story on the six o'clock news with even less fact. Obviously written to sell, not to illuminate the people it pretends to reveal. Come on, is this all that can be said about &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;? Any PBS program dealing with WWII is infinitely superior and informative."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw does an excellent job of interviewing and capturing the impact of WWII on the lives of these heroes and heroines. The war experience was the common bond that elevated this generation to strive for greatness not only for their own lives but for the entire nation. Brokaw, drawing from his vast experience and skills as a newscaster, is able to extract stories of great bravery and self responsibility from each of the individuals interviewed. He brings out the sense of loyalty, duty, honor, respect and self worth, not found in today's generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My father died on board ship in 1945 and was buried at sea, I was only 2 yrs old. This book makes me sad to think of all the lessons he could have taught me. If you read this book make sure you have a box of tissues close by for the tears you will shed both of sadness and joy. It truly was are greatest generation"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The events in this book took place during my high school years. Our only information about this time was thru the media, i.e., radio, newpaper, and movie newsreels. To read about the actual experiences of these people was eye opening and added to my understanding of that war much as the movie SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did to make more relevant. My 6th grade teacher daughter said they both should be required reading/viewing for that age group."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is fantastic. I am 34 years old, reading this book brought back memories of all of the comments my granparents made about this time in America. This book should be required reading for High-school juniors and seniors who feel that after a community project or two (undoubtedly for school credit) feel they are &quot;owed&quot; something. Thank you, Mr. Browkaw, for letting me read about what I didnt have the sense to listen for (from my Grandparents). Mark K."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Although some of the chapters were redundant, The Greatest Generation is a great lesson in history and should be required reading in every high school and college throughout this nation. Then maybe...just maybe we Baby-boomers, and Generation X'ers and Angsters and Ganstas and the self-righteous, and selfish, and self-indulgent, and self-pitying might return to a value system based on responsibility, work, selflessness, fairness, commitment, honesty, and loyalty."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The day I bought this book I couldn't wait to start reading it. But I soon realized it was just another Politically correct book from one of TV's talking heads. Almost every life story in the book was about how they made it through the war and into the Democratic party to make the world a better place, with a few token stories about some other people who happened to be republicans and thus thier stories were glossed over. My question is, What does politics have to do with these storise? A disappointing book over all."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Since World War Two, we have all traveled our separate paths, and all of us have had many blissful and sad times, but somehow one thing has always remained in my memory, that never before nor since has there been a time when we were as together as we were then, as certain of what we wanted and who we were. For many of us it is one of the most intense and personal memories of our lives. It was certainly the end of our age of innocence. However having said that, I can honestly say that calling us the Greatest Generation is quite pretentious. Let us remember that it was also a time, as through out our history where many indiscretions and inproprieties occurred. Nevertheless it was a group of outstanding and remarkable citizens who united together and rolled with the punches. I was born in the roaring twenties and I believe that all generations may not have to cope with a depression nor a war but they all have something great to offer that will always be unique and different."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Very easy book to read but the author needed to have longer chapters about indivduals and should have profiled fewer people. I came away with the feeling that only veterans from south dakota made a difference in the war. As a vietnam vet I was interested in the few comparisons that the author made between ww11 and the vietnam conflict. I feel that the author was trying to get present generations to be more thankful to the ww11 vet and he makes his case that we indeed should do that. I will try to seek out the ww11 vet in my hometown and simply say thank you and hopefully 30 years from now tom brokaw will write a book about the vietnam war and generation z will seek me out and say thank you."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"While most people described in this book are certainly interesting, many are regular people (like me) with fine achievements but with no particular attractiveness to warrant inclusion in a &quot;greatest&quot; list. I keep waiting to see what many of these &quot;greatest&quot; people did,,,and wonder why my parents, of the same generation and with a better story (at least in my opinion), weren't included! Short, basic bios. Its a fair night stand book...for those who fall asleep easily."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Seeing &quot;pvt. ryan&quot; piqued in me an interest in the sacrafices made by those individuals, specifically At Normandie, and generally in the free world at that time, that evil be vanquished, and order restored to the world. That interest led me to several excellent tomes by Stephen Ambrose, and then to Mr. Brokaw's work. I was swept up in the spirit of the book, the stories which it told. Brokaw is to be commended, for his effort, and especially for the sentiments behind it. I wish that I had been able to take part in the events,(1984 not &quot;44) that inspired him. However, once the swelling of pride and gratitude recede, and one looks at the work, it regretably does not deliver. Brokaw has not the training to put the proper tone into these stories. They lay flat. Perhaps if more time were given to fewer stories, it would be possible to achieve that level. Brokaw writes as a newsman, not displaying enough of the emotion he so obviously (to those who have seen his promotional spots on Rosie, Tim Russet, etc.) feels."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book does an admirable job of describing the great accomplishments of the WW2 generation. Many people with little preparation became heroes or millionaires. But to call them the 'Greatest Generation' totally misses the point on what it takes to make one great. It isn't just great accomplishments, it's having great values - and passing these on to your children so that when you're gone the world is a better place. Look at the children neglected while their mothers work. Look at the skyrocketing national debt. Look at the social security debacle. The 'Greatest Generation' passed all these on to us to solve.Look around Tom... they were a major failure."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It is true that not many people from this generation have chosen to reveal their attitudes toward their experiences. My grandparents were young adults during this time and there have not been very many facts that they have revealed regarding their life experiences. Mr. Brokow, through this book and the people he interviewed, offered those of us who did not grow up during these times a wounderful chance to gain insight to the experiences of their day. As a history teacher, this book has allowed me to strengthen my appreciation to the men and women who bravely fought and served to ensure that future generations would have the freedom that we do. A freedom that today many of us take for granted. It is an appreciation that I hope I can pass on to my students. To the men and women of this generation, I say a heartfelt thank you and to the people of other generations I say read this book. You just might learn something from it that will enrich you own life."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Sentimental, shallow book about WWII vets. I agree with his assessment of the generation, however. Read Stephen Ambrose if you want good WWII books. This book is only selling because the author is a celebrity. Duh."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Just in time, you might say, Tom Brokaw has produced the perfect bathroom reader for the older generation. A collection of short takes on individual lives that started out in WWII and went well from there, one can sit and read until drowned in sugar. The message is clear: this is the generation that fought the war, came home heroes, set up shop and became successful at everything. Available in large print and on cassette, it is targeted for the generation that, having putatively done it all, now want to sit and admire themselves.I would like to offer a modest corrective: this is the generation that brought us fallout shelters, fast food, theme parks, the Vietnam war--just a little one for the kids?--and the edsel. Furthermore, as the saying goes, they don't get it: They don't get it about ecology; they don't get it about population control; they don't get it about gays in the military; they don't get it about the importance of innercity kids, they don't get bluejeans, t-shirts, or the Rolling Stones. I am glad these people had good lives, of course, but I came a little later (1945) and I live in a different world from them. I can't wait for the day when I am no longer expected to vote for a WWII hero for President. We don't have to worry about Brokaw's book: it will reach its constuentcy and they will keep it handy. If they wanted to sell it to me, it would be on a CD."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's limited journalism experience is evident, as is an obviously liberal bias. My parents both fought in WWII and survived. My mother was the first woman to fly 100 combat missions in U.S. history. A feat I did not learn of until I was a college student and discovered her citation and Air Medal. She described working in the Nursing ward at Mitchell Field in New York, New York and crying at seeing all the returning young soldiers with missing limbs, shattered souls and broken bodies. I don't think Lloyd Cutler's being drafted into the Army in 1944 and then using his Ivy League influence to avoid overseas assignment to D-Day was worthy of inclusion. Particularly since the young man who took his place was killed three days after the landing. While he and others mistakenly described themselves as &quot;special&quot;, I find his biography shameful. Brokaw paints him as a man among giants and a leader of this Greatest Generation. He was an &quot;insider&quot; with access to power. But he wasn't a leader of the Greatest Generation. He only benefited from the sacrifices of it. Oh, and I forgot to point out. Brokaw takes every opportunity to ridicule the Republican Party, Conservatism and Faith. A worthy topic with worthy people, at least most of them. Too bad the writer wasn't up to the task."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Shame on Tom Brokaw for giving an epic title to a book that is clumsily written and tedious to read. I am totally underwhelmed by the lack of substance in this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw is what I would call a \\"pop\\" book. It's written to be a bestseller but not what I would consider a literary heavyweight. While the premise of The Greatest Generation is very noble, the writing was too simplistic.Tom Brokaw traveled to Normandy, France for both the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the D-Day Invasion. He was especially touched by the stories of the returning veterans, which gave him the idea for this book. Each chapter is devoted to a different person or persons. Most were soldiers, some were famous and some not. He also highlights people who had support roles during World War II. Many opportunities opened up for women as so many men were in uniform. Brokaw also covers the shameful aspects of this period including discrimination of blacks and women by the military as well as the Japanese Internment Camps.I do believe that the people who lived through World War II are the greatest generation. My parents are included in this group. Having barely survived the Depression, they were then forced to deal with the realities of war. According to Brokaw, they were all honorable, courageous, spiritual, dependable, hardworking, loyal and modest. Although these are noble attributes, Brokaw showcases the best and the brightest. What about the soldiers who returned home with psychological scars? I'm sure many became alcoholics or drug addicts. Other veterans were not easy to live with as they bottled up all their memories and emotions from the war. I just think that in trying to be a cheerleader for this generation, Brokaw is not providing a true picture. It also seems as if The Greatest Generation is written on a 5th grade reading level.I did learn a few facts by reading The Greatest Generation and many of Brokaw's profiles are interesting. But do not think that this book is a major literary work."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I recommend this excellent book of true stories from the memories of brave men and women and their families who lived thru the great depression and fought in the second world war.Tom Brokaw walked the beaches of Normandy with American veterans who had returned for the fortieth anniversary of D-Day. He was inspired to reach out and collect individual stories from those difficult years so we will never forget the horrors of that war, the sacrifices by our service men and women and their families, and the results that followed.Finally, a memorial to this generation has been dedicated in Washington D.C. on this, the sixtieth anniversary of D-Day. THE GREATEST GENERATION should occupy a place in our home library, among the works of other historians. You will recognize some of the people in this book, you will be amazed at the achievements and the courage of these ordinary people who survived a perilous time in American history, and you will reflect on your own memories of that time if you are &quot;over sixty&quot;.The author acquaints us with some of his own family history and why he feels it important for us to be forever grateful to all those who defend our American freedom and democracy. I thoroughly enjoyed this well researched and well written book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My husband and I listened to the audio version of THE GREATEST GENERATION while we were on a road trip. Aside from the fact that the history was enlightening, the stories and the way that Tom Brokaw presented the material made it very entertaining.In his position at NBC News, the author had apparently corresponded, or personally spoken with a lot of World War II veterans and recorded their experiences and inspiring stories into this book. Their thoughts and remembrances are warmly told and it made me proud of the American soldiers, the regular GI's, who gave up a part of their youth and fought so bravely for their country. Their stories are emotional and heartfelt!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book. The American spirit during WWII is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of Japan and Germany. Whether this generation is the &quot;greatest&quot; or not, there is no doubt in my mind that the cooperative effort that was required to defend freedom and defeat the fascists is without a doubt the greatest effort in history."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw did a wonderful job with this book. You can really feel what all those people went through and all of the sacrifices they had to make. My faverite chapter in the book was the one about Thomas and Eileen Broderick. Thomas was a paratrooper in World War Two. He jumped into a shootout one time and a bullet hit him right in the head. He later found out that he would be blind for the rest of his life. This is just one of the many tragic and touching stories in this wonderful book. I recomend you go out and buy this book right away."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book was nothing what I expected. I can now understand where some of the great people of today came from. Tom writes as if he were in awe of these people. I know I was after I read the book. This book covers the time before and during WWII. You can see the people he writes about selling newspapers, building planes, women flying the planes. This is a really feel good book. You will come away feeling great about your relatives who lived during this time. This book answered many &quot;Why&quot; questions. If you have been lucky enough to live in a close family, this will give you the reason so many familys are close, and what true family values are all about. You have heard many politicians speak of this, but this book has the answer. I didn't put it down until it was finished. I don't like Tom, but I respect his writing ability and the way he presented this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Yes, I go to high school and I still have great respect for the generation that has kept this country free. The people that fought in World War II is a generation unlike any other and Tom Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation portrays that. The book, which almost reads like a novel, tells the stories of men and women of all races that were involved in the war. I am greatful for this book because most of the veterans interviewed said that they would never have told their story if it wasn't for this book. Tom Brokaw, although he doesn't go into any major details, does send the message loud and clear that this generation is the most responsible, brave and modest group of people of present day. Reading the stories of these brave veterans convinced me that that generation was the greatest. Anyone that thinks otherwise need only to read this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw has done the century a fine service. But for my money, I prefer D.J. Tice's 'Minnesota's Twentieth Century: Stories of Extraordinary Everyday People.' You needn't be from Minnesota (or even know where Minnesota is!) to appreciate these elegantly crafted accounts of lives otherwise little-remembered. The chapter on the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 is alone worth the price of the book. And let us never forget the Duluth lynching of 1920. You've forgotten already? That's why you need this book. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw's book highlights a great generation of people. If you don't agree, don't read the book. If you think these people were the &quot;worst generation&quot;, remember that they were the last to defend this country before the current trend of &quot;draft dodgers&quot; (example #1 - the president). I enjoyed reading their stories and I'm thankful that these people are our history. If you don't respect this generation and their sacrifices, you won't enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Good material about &quot;Great&quot; people. However, reading this book is like enduring a detailed description of a 1/16 inch layer of ice covering a pond that is teeming with life. We see nothing below the surface or its impact on its surroundings. Perhaps this is what I should have expected from a person who makes his living from 30 second sound bites. I do agree that it was a &quot;great generation&quot;I am the same age as Mr. Brokaw, a veteran of the 1960's US Army and have logged over 2 million air miles in business travel around the world. Many of the young men and women with whom I have served, worked and communicated measure up remarkably well to the standards set by the WW11 generation. Mr Brokaw insinuates that they do not - I suggest he step back from his circle of associates in the media and visit the &quot;real&quot; people in Americas cities, small towns and rural areas. The majority still believe in the values of honesty, integrity, hard work and sacrifice for the common good. As much as our media and political leaders have tried to convince us that these are not important - they will fail. The &quot;GREATEST GENERATION&quot; will be the one following the &quot;BOOMERS&quot; and they will rise to the crisis of re-establishing values and morals in our leaders and media."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Rarely has a book been able to capture the essence of a generation like &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. Being the son of a WWII veteran and the nephew of a Silver Star recipient,I can attest to the fortitude and quiet courage these people displayed. Mr.Brokaw conveys his message in a strong but subdued manner without overdramafication. It seems as if he is well aware that the stories these brave people have to tell are dramatic and suspenseful enough without having to resort to the sensationalism that is so prevelant in todays' journalistic writings. I especially liked the way Mr.Brokaw intertwined regular everyday Americans with those of some notoriety and fame. In closing, I found this to be a very powerful book and came away with a renewed sense of respect and awe for the generation that had to go from the Great Depression almost immediately into a world war."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is an outstanding book, documenting the quickly-decreasing generation of those who lived through WWII."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw did a great job of showing how ordinary people faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges became extraodinary."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"\\"The Greatest Generation\\" reminds me of biographies printed for class reunions or interviews published in a small town newspaper. In \\"The Greatest Generation\\" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This should be required reading for High School and College students - heck, anyone under the age of 60.Brokaw does a marvelous job with these short insights into the people who built America up. Funny, sad, poignant - they run the gamut of emotions.I think people in the United States would be a lot happier and nicer to each other if they could find in themselves what this generation did."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I noticed common themes in the stories that Brokaw wrote about in this book. These people were very patriotic. Most of these people grew up during The Depression. They appreciated family and survival. They worked hard and made something of themselves after the war. They endured discrimination and yet they were not bitter as a result. They did not want to talk about the war and if they were recognized as heros, they were humble and accepted their awards as a symbol of all those that fought beside them. This was a truly amazing generation. I believe the circumstances of the time influenced them to become what they were. They paved the way for the next generation to come . They didn't understand the younger generations and felt slightly removed but I don't think that made them any different then the generation that preceded them. I am glad I had the opportunity to read this book. Especially since a lot of them gone to their great reward. God Bless them."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I bought this book for my children. I am so thankful that someone told this story. This Greatest Generation is slowly slipping away. I am a baby boomer and my father [their grandfather] was an Italian immigrant. He was very aware of the freedom he enjoyed in this country and was willing to fight against the tyrrany of a very sick dictator! Their other grandfather fought at Pearl Harbor. Their future wives worked hard here at home for the war effort. Both men thankfully survived to go on and help rebuild this country where their families could grow up safely and with more opportunities than they knew. These dear family members have now passed on. I wanted my children to understand what their grandparents endured and to be very proud of the unselfishness of that Greatest Generation. They didn't have state-of-the-art everything, but they had loyalty, integrity, determination and grit that far overshadowed any doubts or fears. Their example of selflessness was an honorable trait. We should all strive to emulate their noble character."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This very moving book teaches more lessons than I can include in one review. By now most readers probably already know the basic theme - it's the story of a number of representatives of the generation that lived through the depression, fought World War II, and built post-war America. Many of the stories will bring tears to your eyes and make you recognize how far we have fallen from the standard of sacrifice and non-whining patriotism that these people took for granted as standards to live by.But perhaps I can point out an additional, less-commented-on lesson from the book: Despite the consistent themes of responsibility and duty which underlie almost every account, these people were far more diverse than we today have given them credit for. They were not monolithically conservative, worshipers of the Establishment, traditionally religious, obsessed with making money, conformist gray-flannel people with 2.6 kids and a stay-at-home mom in each family. For example, when the Viet Nam war and the associated 60s protests arrived, the reactions and tolerance levels of these people varied widely. Their values and lifestyles were about as diverse as those we find in our new century.The one clear difference between that generation and subsequent ones can be summed up in two words: no whining. In the entire book, I don't recall a single individual even mentioning the word \\"rights\\" as they applied to himself or herself. No one believed that he or she was entitled to special privileges or to live at the expense of anyone else. No one expected the world to be fair. They took the world as they found it, and made the best of it.The only failure that the Greatest Generation can be charged with is that they were so successful in building a society where everything came easily. That in turn gave rise to the generations of adult brats who gave this book negative reviews because they couldn't believe some of the UNsolved problems could have been so hard to solve. The life of ease bequeathed to us by the Greatest Generation has obscured the natural hardships of life that made loyalty and hard work a necessary trait for survival. People now have the luxury of sitting back and leisurely lecturing their forebears on how THEY would have done everything better. When we hear (or read) such nonsense, I don't know whether the proper reaction is to laugh condescendingly or to throw up."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I read the book and I've read some of the reviews. The book is an easy read. It is not a literary breakthrough, but a good story about a sometimes forgotten generation. The accusations by reader/reviewers of racism, bias, poor research, poor enunciation are surprising. It is too bad we cannot read and enjoy a book for what it is: A tribute to some of those who fought and preserved our freedom. I didn't expect to read a factual history, detailed analysis, of the period and I am surprised that others did. I enjoyed the stories, the point of view and even the parts that I found too wordy and somewhat boring. But, I guess I'm too tolerant."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw deserves credit for providing a major tribute to a generation that for too long has been underappreciated. Unfortunately, people in their late 70s and older are just seen -- particularly by Gen Xers and Gen Yers -- as OLD; with most of us having little understanding of the sacrifices and contributions they made towards making America what it is today. I agree with Brokaw that the WWII generation may be the greatest generation in America's history for the various reasons he cites in his book. As a book, however,The Greatest Generation, while interesting, does not fulfill the promise I was anticipating. Basically, what Brokaw has done is provide a series of short, somewhat fluffy chronicles of the lives of WWII veterans from various cross-sections of the United States. While these chronicles, as I said, are interesting, they do not provide enough depth and insight into how these individuals' wartime achievements contributed to what they accomplished after the war. Nonetheless, The Greatest Generation is a book worth reading for the main value it provides -- making each of the post-WWII generations understand and appreciate better a generation which, sadly, will not be with us for too much longer."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I so wanted to enjoy this book. My grandparents, people I love dearly, are part of this &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; so it was with great enthusiasm that I read this book. In my mind it would be a sort of homage to them. Unfortunately, I am still struggling to get past the poor writing. Obviously, Brokaw is a journalist and not a writer, but I expected that even he would be able to spin a compelling collection of stories that would make me (someone who actually already believes that they are) see this generation as being &quot;the greatest.&quot; Sadly, Tom, it takes more than simply calling them that. I found myself wishing I could have a dollar for each time Brokaw slapped a superlative on some poorly told tale and expected me to come out feeling that these individuals were the best of the best. I am certain that there are stories out there (and maybe even some that were in the book) that would answer the promise of the book's title. Unfortunately, Brokaw (1) cannot write, and (2) is so self-important that he thought just telling me I should admire this generation would be enough. These stories should have told themselves. They did not. I was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. I agree with Tom Brokaw's premise that the World War II generation may be the greatest in American history, and for the reasons he cites. It is a pity that he doesn't follow through with a book that really proves his argument. What Brokaw gives the reader is a series of brief, fluffy profiles of the lives of World War II veterans from many walks of life. These stories are interesting as far as they go; unfortunately, Brokaw doesn't delve deep enough to support the main contention of his book. He seems to have concentrated on individual achievements during the war (which were inarguably outstanding), but gave relatively short shrift to his subjects' postwar achievements (which to me should have been the essential proof of Brokaw's overall premise. After all, many veterans who served in the decades since World War II have also become community leaders, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and politicians; it may be fairly argued that many of their achievements, while not yet fully tested in the crucible of history, will prove as significant as those of the generation Brokaw writes about). I also was left questioning how careful the author was in selecting the subjects about which he wrote. It seemed many of his selections were based on his own personal knowledge of the people he chronicled. Perhaps, with more research, he could have found subjects whose achievements after the war provided better support for his argument.Like other reviewers, I found the author's writing to be at best average. He writes very much like he speaks; as a long-time viewer of NBC Nightly News, I found myself almost able to hear Brokaw's voice as I read along.&quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is a book which I feel has great potential left unfulfilled. It could have been a towering chronicle of the lives of some genuine American heroes, but falls short due to obviously inadequate research and a lack of focus. Its one major redeeming feature is that it has made generations of Americans since World War II understand better, and respect more, the people whose sacrifices during the war really did change the second half of the twentieth century. In doing that, this book does serve an admirable purpose."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am only 17, but my Grandfather fought in WWII. A book like this is very rare. As I have learned it's very hard for veterans to talk about their experiences. And, yes, this generation is slipping away from us and to have thier experiences written down for other, future generations to read is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The theme throughout the book is that the generation of Americans that participated in World War II rarely talk about it. My father might have been one of Tom Brokaw's examples. While I was regaled with tales of self-reliance and want during a depression, he almost never spoke about his experience in the African campaign, or the wound that nearly cost him a leg. The author made it a point of finding out a good many stories, not unlike Dad's, even as these veterans are now dying at the rate of 1800 a day. Each page was like going back to my childhood, and listening to stories I never heard before.Brokaw leaves no stone unturned or class of veteran out in the cold. He starts with ordinary people, the people on the home front, heroes, women in uniform and out, [our] shame, love, marriage and commitment, and famous people.The ordinary people were just that, ordinary in an extraordinary way. Parents and kids were compelled to survive by keeping the family unit intact. Parents searched for any job that would bring cloth or food to the home, and children disciplined by denial, accomplished a full day of work before going to school. They made do, they went without, or they made it themselves. These were the people who were already in training for their participation in World War II, but didn't realize it.The people on the home front toiled eighty-hours a week to keep the troops in equipment and supplies. Farm boys were highly sought after by Boeing, builders of the B-17 Flying Fortress and the B-29 Super Fortress. The company knew that when the farm tractor broke down it had to be fixed, on the spot, without help. Their intuition paid off many times over.The home front could also be said to be the start of the women's movement. For the first time, women did jobs that had hitherto been considered only for men. Dorothy Haener never married preferring to keep her position as a UAW organizer, and her responsibilities grew as the union grew. (Marriage often meant being fired).There were plenty of heroes who never bragged about their achievements. Although Bob Bush was a navy corpsman, he picked up an automatic pistol dropping eight charging enemy Japanese as he held a plasma bottle over a wounded marine. Instead of focusing on the Medal of Honor given him by President Truman, he raced back to the Northwest to start a thriving lumber business. Leonard \\"Bud\\" Lomell, US Army Ranger, used the G.I. Bill to go to law school and start his own law firm in New Jersey. He took his time training new lawyers and hiring women counselors. He didn't see why they should be left out. Talent and performance were his main concern just as it was in the Rangers. He never lost touch with them either.The women in uniform during World War II, would constitute the first ever to achieve flag rank long after the war's end. They were Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAACS), Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service (WAVES), Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASPS), SPARS of the Coast Guard (Semper Peratus and its English translation, Always Ready, combined), and nurses. The WASPS tested and ferried planes of all types to training sites, or from factory to airfield. Expert pilots, they were still considered civilians, and none of them received veterans' benefits even though thirty-eight of them died in the line of duty. They were unceremoniously sent home in 1944 as men filled more ranks and plane production began to taper off.If World War II was the start of the women's movement, it certainly ignited civil rights where African American soldiers were expected to fight and die while watching German prisoners receive better accommodations than they did. Martha Settle Putney, now a retired history professor, was taking a train to her base in Texas along with several white officers who insisted that she sit with them. Even so, the train conductor refused to accept her Pullman car ticket and directed her to a freight train in the rear. Refusing to go, the conductor summoned the MP's. He was dumbfounded when the MP's, noticing her lieutenant's bars, simply saluted. They courteously escorted her to a military plane that would take her to her assignment. Martha Putney recognized that the war gave her an opportunity that she would have never dreamed of otherwise.Our shame went beyond our treatment of African Americans. Nisei, Americans of Japanese ancestry, were rounded up as \\"enemy combatants\\" and placed in internment camps while their property and work of a lifetime was lost or stolen. It saw the best in us, as one Nisei left his grocery store in the hands of an employee. \\"It'll be here when you get back,\\" he told him. True to his word, he simply handed back the keys when the owner returned. But the experience more aptly demonstrated our darker character. Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye, in uniform, and minus one arm, was refused a haircut in Honolulu. He was one of hundreds of volunteers, most of them from the camps that would make up the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. The regiment was awarded seven Presidential Unit Citations and twenty-one of their members received the Medal of Honor. The \\"Go for Broke\\" RCT became the most highly decorated regiment in US history.The intensity of war also brought the intensity in love and relationships where the separations actually made the bonds grow stronger, and the feeling that so much time apart meant that there was so much more time to make up for together. Wives became accustomed to their husbands' nightmares and their industry to ensure their family would never have to want. They wouldn't divorce. Marriage was a commitment as strong as the one to put on a uniform, or to hold a family together in a depression. Some wives and sweethearts found little to celebrate on V-J Day, as the War Department had already informed them that their loved one would not be coming home, or would not see the child born in their absence.Many would achieve fame in a variety of endeavors: Ben Bradlee, Art Buchwald, Andy Rooney, Julia Child, Gertrude Belle Elion, Chesterfield Smith, Al Neuharth, Maurice \\"Hank\\" Greenberg. Many others would enter politics such as Mark Hatfield, Robert Dole, George H. W. Bush, Daniel Inouye, Casper Weinberger, Lloyd Cutler, George Schultz, Arthur Schlesinger, and Ed Guthman.What becomes clear is that this generation learned discipline and faith through the depression. They gained confidence and a deeper faith through war. A promise or handshake was as good as a contract, and a marriage was for life. They survived a depression and would not allow themselves to be beaten by enemies that were mere mortals. They helped America achieve a greatness that it had never known before, and will never have again. Being an American in 1945 had as much prestige as saying, \\"I am a citizen of Rome\\" did in its day. Tom Brokaw simply tells the stories of people across the country who did their part in World War II and how they readjusted to civilian life. These are common stories that held my interest from start to finish.We honored these veterans a long time ago when there were stars in the windows of our homes and shops; blue for those serving, silver for those overseas, and the dreaded gold for those killed in action. We still have the ability to learn first hand about those who delivered our nation from fascism and totalitarianism. Although Veterans Day is a holiday, we can make it a learning day by asking and listening to those who served at home and around our globe.We could actually spend this Veterans Day honoring our veterans.This is for you, Dad. US Army Signal Corps 1939-1945Happy Birthday: Oct. 16.March 10, 2010:Today, in our nation's capital, surviving women of the W.A.S.P.s are finally being honored with a Congressional Gold medal for the service they courageously performed during World War II. They will also qualify for full veterans' benefits. It's about time!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This incredible book made me take a good long look at myself and my generation, known as Generation X. Tom Brokaw's re-introduction of the aptly named &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; to us young people was long overdue. If only the teenagers today could understand what our Grandparents did for all of us. As I have just really found out. I read this book voraciously, and found myself in tears, but could never put it down. As a matter of fact, I felt that twinge of sadness as I found myself at the last page. I am purchasing three more copies to send to my younger cousins. I hope they get as much from it as I did. An incredible book, which will send me into the new millenium with a greater understanding of how America has changed in a mere 60 years."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"As a baby boomer I have greatly bennificated from the sacrifaces of the World War II generation. Coming of age during the Great Depression and going straight into the bloodiest war in history,this generation had every right to turn its back on everything. Instead,after beating Nazi Germany and Japan they built a strong economy,laid the basis for the 40 year victory in the Cold War,and now in retirement,they continue to do public service. I hate to think what would have happened if this would have fallen on my generation. THANKS TO THE WORLD WAR II GENERATION FOR EVERYTHING WE HAVE TODAY."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"When I began this book, I knew it was about my parents' generation. I did not understand that it covered so thoroughly their sacrifices in and around World War II. Throughout the book, I thought about my uncle, who was in Europe and Japan during the war. I gained a greater understanding of the way members of my family, my friends' parents and people in the public eye behaved. Tom Brokaw presents a compelling picture of the values and fortitude that contribute positively to the fabric of our society. Without pointing out the differences, he demonstrates very well what we have lost in our generation. His words are minimal and important. He does not write one word that does not need to be included. The stories are spare; he draws us into the lives of the people he presents. I finished the book reluctantly, glad I read it, filled with a new understanding and wanting more. Thank goodness there is a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom Brokaw tells the stories of the men &amp; women, the heroes &amp; heroines who came of age during the Great Depression &amp; the Second World War, &amp; who went on to build modern America. This is an absorbing read about our parents &amp; grandparents. Tom Brokaw writes as he speaks, with fluent, descriptive insights. Cogent details set the scenes of the stories of this generation who, three score years ago, readily gave up their futures to either go to war or do the support work for the war effort. Here are the youngsters borne from the ashes of the War To End All Wars; gaining in years even as their nation &amp; those around the world first soared in the post-war hysteria only to plummet later into the Great Depression. Tom Brokaw &amp; his crew have done a superb job!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I purchased this book after seeing some of Tom Brokaw's specials about the WWII veterans; in addition to thinking this was going to be an oral history as told by the veterans themselves. I wouldn't call it an oral history because most of the \\"talking\\" was done by Tom Brokaw. The stories come across as a warm, syrupy tribute to the veterans who fought in the Great War (WWII) as well as those who \\"fought\\" on the homefront. You can just hear the honey dripping if this was a TV salute. Unfortunately, we don't get enough of the veterans stories...only a handful of paragraphs with a lot of Brokaw commentary in between.In saying that, we don't really get a LOT of detail from their fighting, only a couple of paragraphs followed by a lot of \\"after war\\" stories; i.e., what happened to them after the war and how they did or did not prosper.I think the book could have been better if it had relied almost exclusively on the veterans' stories with a bit of recap from Brokaw.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book. But, I was happy to finish it and move on to another book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Of course I had heard of this book for quite some time before I read it. I enjoyed it, but it dragged a little. I was actually more interested in the people's war stories than what they did in their civilian lives after the war. Pretty mundane and ordinary, but maybe that's the point. All in all, I liked it and will pass it on to others."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I think the premise of this book is great. The generation that survived the depression and fought in WWII was the pivotal generation in American history. They saved the world from tyranny, helped bring about the civil rights movement, built the interstate highway system, built a modern education system, and did it with quiet dignity and grace. They did bring us their whiny offspring the baby boomers (who think they are the greatest generation for introducing drugs and free love) but no one is perfect.While the stories and vignettes were interesting, I wanted more. Brokaw never goes in depth to explore the true magnitude of what these people accomplished. This is a good starter book, or appetizer. For the main course, I would recommend one of Stephen Ambrose' excellent works on WWII."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This book is in a real sense a long and general thank you letter to a generation. While the flavor of appreciation comes across as very real in this book I was hoping for a more acedemic and researched direction. I was dissapointed. The generation of the 40's deserves this book for the gratitude that it heaps on them, though I don't agree they are quite the saints as they are protrayed. Not much substance...Please some historian/writer follow the idea and write a proper book!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Excellent book for members of generation X who want to understand the views of their grandparents and where those views stemmed from. Gives a new sense of Patritosim towards our great nation and for the men and women who fought and loved durring one of the hardest times in modern United States history."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I hesitate to give this book only three stars, because it might not signify how much I appreciated reading it. I'm two generations removed from Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; and while I consider myself somewhat educated had never really appreciated the sacrifices made during WWII. So why didn't I give it a higher rating? Probably because I save those 4 and 5 star ratings for books one can truly call great -- ones which are that rare combination of style and content that result in a great work of art.There's little that is artistic about Brokaw's book, nor should there be. It is reported in a journalistic style, of course. But that being said, it is a book well worth reading and one that I recommend."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I wish I had listened to this book before my grandfather died. He might have discussed it with me. Like many of the people in the book, he never talked about his time in the war. He came back to his hometown and carved a life out of the Virginia farmland. He proudly saved this piece of America for his children and grandchildren.We learn in the book that men and women did all they could for the war effort. Many women were suddenly needed to do things they were never allowed to do before the war. Many used the opportunity to start down a path they had only previously dreamed of following.Each story is different, each person fighting or losing according to circumstance or fate. They knew that the force they were fighting was a dangerous one. Every American owed it to the country to do whatever was necessary to win.They fought for the right for Americans to be free to make choices, but often wonder about the choices young people make today. As we follow them through the words of Tom Brokaw from teenagers to seasoned citizens, we learn why they treasure those things we often take for granted."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Evidently, the good news anchorman has been watching a little too much Saving Private Ryan lately. Naturally, the book gloats with little restraint over this generation's stance against fascism, neglecting its evident shortcomings as a nation half-governed by Jim Crow laws, or the social preception of the proper role of women as being confined to the household. Simply utilizing the fact that this generation took such actions that would easily have been undertaken by any sane people under these circumstances as an excuse to decry other generations as less worthy is grossly unfair. Yet, given Tom's journalistic background, his embellishments is hardly surprising. If anything, this book is testimony that history can only be properly evaluated by historians, not the news media."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The Greatest Generation is Tom Brokaw's tribute to the generation of Americans who lived through the Depression, fought in World War II and built the United States in the post-war era. It is a moving tribute to a generation that was collectively marvelous.Brokaw begins The Greatest Generation by drawing upon his coverage of the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the D-Day landings. The stories of the remarkable people who participated in that historic event and war follow from his involvement at the anniversary. Essentially, the Depression hardened that generation, the war and military service gave them discipline and the GI Bill gave them opportunities to education that they would never have had otherwise. With a combination of work ethic, discipline and education that generation achieved mightily and in Brokaw's view is indeed The Greatest Generation.The Greatest Generation starts out very strongly as Brokaw explains how he became motivated to write the book and why he considers that generation to be magnificent. The stories of ordinary people who were forged by war are truly inspiring. About half way through there is a shift from people whose names are not common to those whose names are very familiar. Brokaw talks about people like George Bush, Bob Dole and war hero Joe Foss. While their stories are inspiring, I preferred the stories of the small town doctor, the black machinist and housewife with a baby who lost her husband in Holland; everyday people. Perhaps that's Brokaw's weakness. As a newsman he has been dealing with the rich and famous for too long and is no longer comfortable with plain folks. Whatever the reason, I found the first half of his story better than the second.Brokaw's tribute is specifically aimed at Americans. However, all the values that he extols are not uniquely American. In fact, two of the people he profiles were or are married to Canadians, one of who served with the famed 82nd Airborne. Furthermore, many of the people who immigrated to the US after WWII contributed to the post-war development bringing the same value system that Brokaw highlights. Perhaps The Greatest Generation is an even greater generation than Brokaw realizes.I listened to the audio version that features Brokaw reading himself. His distinctive mid-western accent and minor speech impediment do add to the poignant stories of people leaving small town USA to fight in WWII. Brokaw brings to the story a passion that is evident when he reads it himself.All in all The Greatest Generation is an enjoyable and light analysis of a large group of people. It would have been even better if he had stuck to the regular folks and not gone for the celebrities half way through."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mr. Brokaw relates the stories of the men and women who shaped what our world is today. It is very important that these stories be told, as we are losing so many of our loved ones because of old age.It is a book that made me want to know more about my family during that time, and I'm certain this will spur many others to ask: &quot;What was it like back then?&quot;Excellent job!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I did find this repetitive and at times boring. To be quite honest with you I skipped many, many pages because it was much of the same style of writing. Here we have heroes who have done amazing, courageous things only to have those heroics watered down with bland writing. It just goes to show you that almost anyone who can read, look good on a t.v. screen and speak clearly can be an anchorman"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This is a book everyone should read. It gives you pride in your elders, hope in your leaders, and faith in yourself."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw wouldn't sell many books with that title so he had to fog it in a bit. Yes, my parents generation gave willingly and sacrificed much. They had a definition of what the words duty, honor and commitment meant more than my generation does and, I fear, more than my children's generation.However, the lads who risked it all back in 1776 were our greatest generation. No other one even comes close. These were wealthy men who could have settled with The Crown and remained rich. But, they didn't. They risked it all for the sake of an idea. Then, made that idea work better and stronger than any society in the history of the world. Adams, Jefferson, Washington, etc. They were our Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Tom's book was a good read. Overall I would rate it as &quot;ok&quot;. He nailed his main theme pretty well. The people who fought the war and suffered all of it's horrors came home afterwards and went quietly about their business without fanfare and with no complaining or demands for retributions. That was certainly true to a large extent. However, there actually was a good deal of fanfare and celebration when they arrived home. There was also a huge effort on the part of the government to provide medical assistance and educational opportunites, a point that Brokaw covers but not with the emphasis that it deserves. The G.I. Bill of Rights was probably the finest and one of the most far-reaching government benefits ever conceived. There were also considerable efforts in towns and communities throughout the country. Efforts on the part of private citizens, businesses, churches and other community organizations to welcome home the veterans and to help them get re-established. I know from my own experiences as a youngsterr of 15 that many good deeds were done by many good people. Indeed it was a great generation and those who returrned from the war were magnanimous in their victory. But Brokaw misses a great opportunity to properly credit the millions of ordinary men who were most instrumental in winning the victory and rebuilding their lives and their country in the aftermath. He prefers instead to cite those who became famous and wealthy, those who became well known politicians and those who suffered discrimination on top of their other trevails. Discrimination was a problem during the war but was not the practice of most people, as Brokaw's narrative seems to suggest. In fact the problem was addressed in many ways during the war. A look at today's military will show that the &quot;greatest generation&quot; did not ignore the problem but faced it head on. Today's military exemplifies non-discrimination; a point not mentioned by Brokaw. Brokaw's victims and other non-ordinary folks certainly did their part but by anyone's count, the war was fought and won by ordinary men doing extraordinary things. Of the forty people cited by Brokaw only eight are in this category. As a result this book gives a slanted and inaccurate picture of who did what to whom and for whom. I think of my brother-in-law Jigger and my Uncle Bill and others who I knew who fought in the war and experienced it's horrors and who returned to their homes their families and their work and who demanded nothing but freedom to do so. I expected Mr. Brokaw's book to filled with the stories of such people but there were only eight. The rest was whining about discrimination or extolling the virtues of the rich and famous who were privileged to serve with the ordinary (who really weren't so ordinary). I can't help concluding that Mr. Brokaw dropped the ball at the one-yard line. With two out bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth, Mr. Brokaw struck out. The truly great book about the generation of World War II is yet to written. Donald R. MacDonough"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Which is worse his ego or his partisan views? This guy has an agenda and it's almost as dumbed down as his representation of the news. One more example of the whole show going in the toilet."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"\\"The Greatest Generation\\" is an inspirational collection of short histories about various individuals who served in various roles during World War II. Included is not only stories of soldiers, but also the wives and families left home, some who helped take up the slack in the workplace; the Japanese Americans who were sent to internment camps; and famous people who served. Mr. Brokaw says as a group they generally held high standards of moral values and because of this strength they were able to pull together and defeat the greatest threat to freedom in modern times. Although usually reluctant to discuss their wartime experiences, there are many stories shared here of battlefield experiences, as well as what became of these people after they returned home and tried to make up for lost time.My appreciation for what these men and women did increased. Reading their stories of what they experienced and the trials they faced was very motivational. The only part that I felt wasn't on par with the rest of the book was when it discussed the celebrities and some of the famous politicians (some of whom appeared to have done nothing noteworthy during the war). But other than that it was very inspirational to read about these \\"ordinary\\" people who did extraordinary things, both during and after the war. It helped me gain a greater appreciation for my grandparents and those of their generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"While there are a great number of books about World War II and the men who fought it, this book goes beyond the war itself, and describes the origins of the people profiled, as well as their accomplishments and lifes after the war. I had never really thought through the implications of growing up during the Depression and then mobilizing for the war effort, and how these experiences led to the changes the members of this generation brought about in our society. This book does just that. I developed a deeper appreciation for the ways the experiences of their youth led to the later accomplishments of that generation.This book is a tremendously respectful tribute to the men and women who grew up during the Depression, and came of age during the second world war. Whether they were destined for greatness or fame, or were ordinary citizens, this book provides insights into these remarkable lives and shows the lasting effects of those early life experiences. I have often wondered how I would have reacted had I been faced with challenges such as those faced by Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot; I am thankful that I have not been asked to make such sacrifices, but I also wonder if that lack of a &quot;trial by fire&quot; won't have a long term impact on the accompishments of my generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I tried to finish this homage to every WWII veteran Tom remembers from his distinguished journalistic career, but I couldn't. I got very tired of the author's ego interrupting the story these people told. This book is short on substance. I wanted to read more about their experiences and I felt the interviewer let a lot of good stories slip through his tape recorder. We are treated to a lot of boasting about how honest, hard-working and long-suffering this generation is. Clearly, there are other interviewers/writers who handle this same territory better. Studs Terkle comes to mind immediately. The generation Tom admires may indeed be the greatest. This book isn't."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Too many of the reviews I've seen here are putting the book down for what it may or may not be missing when they should be celebrating it for what it has. Brokaw is not writing a history of the war, he is simply giving short personal accounts of the lives of some of the men and women who lived and served during that time. He does this to support his claim that they are indeed the greatest generation. I, for one. thoroughly enjoyed the book. And to those who must berate the book for minor inaccuracies or other similar shortcomings, I only say this...&quot;read the book for the message brokaw is trying to convey, not for the message YOU want it to convey&quot; Do that, and I'm sure you'll find the book much more to your liking. I applaud Brokaw for such an undertaking."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"At first, I avoided Tom Brokaw's THE GREATES GENERATION due to the promotional publicity it has received. When I learned that John Caulfield, was one of the people interviewed by Brokaw, I picked up the book and was immediately fascinated by the insight it provides to our parents' (yes I am a baby boomer) generation and world they made for us. THE GREATET GENERATION is one of those books of which you can read any chapter or part in any order. Together the people profiled present a picture of an American with a mission and a generation committed to that mission. They fought the Good War, as Studs Turkels similar work chronicled. Today, we need a focus for the future and I recommend another book THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION by Mitchell, Coles and Metz as a blueprint for how our generation and the next can develop the organizational skills to achieve exponential growth in the 21 Century."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"It is sad to see a mainstream news man stoop so low to stroke 1. the nation and 2. his &quot;audience&quot; (for who else must watch and believe mainstream tv news but old timers or people who think like old timers?) The job of a real journalist is never to make people &quot;feel good&quot; in the way that Brokaw does here. A real journalist would probe the terror that the American nation seems to ask each generation of young men to get ready to endure for more often than not false reasons. What's weird is that Brokaw mentions the humility of these people--they don't want to exploit their experiences in war, and he turns around and heroicizes them in precisely the way they seem to not want to be heroically portrayed. Is being sent off to kill another human being ever anything to get ra ra about? Shouldn't we instead look to the day when we never have to contemplate killing each other and write books that bring us in that direction? Like probing this thing called &quot;nationalism&quot; and the last refuge of a scoundrel &quot;patriotism&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"One need not go further than the title to see the pomposity of Mr. Brokaw. A love fest for a dying generation that looks down at every generation that follows because they didn't fight in a war. He fails to mention that fighting in WWII was very unpopular until our mainland was attacked. No, his generation is no better or worse than any other."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Being a fan of Tom's, having a strong interest in history, and having a deep admiration for whom he correctly describes as the greatest generation, I eagerly anticipated reading his book. After reading it though, I came away somewhat disappointed. I remember asking myself when I was done, &quot;This is it?&quot; I suppose it is due in part to searching out and reading about experiences of this generation in the past and thus making the stories in this book repetitive to me. Granted there are endless stories to tell, but there are too few told here and they tend to be told of those who went on to be highly successful afterwards. I would have liked to have seen a more well rounded series of stories. Also, a number of stories were so brief that I wondered what point or example he was trying to get across by including them. Although I can't say I truly enjoyed the book, I would say it should be recommended reading for those generations that are fast becoming removed from this generation and don't realize how important this generation was/is. Hopefully it will then spark their interest to learn more, or to seek out a grandfather or that retired neighbor to hear their personal stories. Hopefully as well, it will open up this greatest generation more to tell their personal stories before they are gone ."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Reading this book was wonderful for me, a 22 year old, and makes even starker the contrast between this generation and the worst generation (the Baby Boomers) who took everything that was handed to them and squandered/destroyed it all in a spectacular way and laughed while they did it. These men who suffered the Depression, won World War 2, and then created the most brilliant society the world has ever seen in the 50s and 60s, deserve to be remembered for the heroes that they are. My generation and theirs can both agree that the Baby Boomers ruined everything, and hopefully my generation will have the opportunity to fix the mess that the narcissistic, whining Boomers left and are still leaving."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the \\"Greatest Generation\\", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the \\"GI Generation\\", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the \\"Silent Generation\\" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression. I don't think just because you're old, you're great, and the author simply would not make the distinction in order to sell copies."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Bought this for my mother. She loves to read and this book was great as she could connect with it.."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I am a veteran of WWII and found the book factual and very interesting Mr. Brokaw is an excellent writer.."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Fascinating stories of individuals thru their difficulties and strivings while in a very difficult time. Chock full of interesting facts about the Great War and the life back at home during the period. We can all take lessons.

Go for the objective ratings of the book itself."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Coming of age in the early 70's I really believed (like most children, I suppose) my mother and dad were hopelessly clueless about life. Reading this book the first year it was published started me on the journey of reviewing my parents' lives, asking questions of my mother about her experiences, and reassessing the World War II generation.Brokaw's book examines the lives and impact of those Americans who were born in the early part of the twentieth century and came of age in time to serve in the military or on the home front during World War II. Brokaw's theory is though the Greatest Generation wasn't perfect, it is the greatest American generation because of its uncomplaining, stoic self-lessness and sacrifice in fighting a world war not only for the U.S. but for France and Great Britain. Of course, the greatest sacrifices were from those who gave their lives but other sacrifices were made by those who were wounded, those who endured mental and spiritual anguish, and those who gave up so much of their lives on the homefront to help fight.Wars are not all the same. Those interested in the Iraq and Vietnam wars and U.S. policy in those conflicts would benefit greatly by reading this book to understand the difference in sacrifice asked of World War II Americans to that asked of later war generations.This is a great book about a great generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I was amazed on how i can personally relate to the characters life story.. eventhough i never went to war or are a veteran.. the living style of back in the days and current life style is so different.. it opens your eyes on how it was and how WE made it.. quality of life has gone down.."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw defines \\"the greatest generation\\" as American citizens who came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America. The vehicle used to define the generation further is the stories told by a cross section of men and women throughout the country.The approximately 50 stories are listed in the table of contents under eight topics: Ordinary People; Homefront; Heroes; Women in Uniform and Out; Shame; Love, Marriage and Commitment; Famous People; and the Arena. The individuals are brought to life by photographs within each chapter.Tom Brokaw went to France to make a documentary marking the 40th anniversary of D-day in 1984. Although he was thoroughly briefed on the historical background of the invasion, he was totally unprepared for how it would affect him emotionally. Flooded with childhood memories of World War II, Brokaw began asking veterans at the ceremony to revisit their past and talk about what happened, triggering a chain reaction of war-torn confessions and Brokaw's compulsion to capture their experiences in what he terms \\"the permanence a book would represent.\\""},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"My wife and I purchased the audio version of the book - our first audio book, but were disappointed that the book was not offered unabridged on the cd version. The book was very moving, especialy since the author, Tom Brokaw, was the narrator. We hated to hear it end! Please, please, purchase the unabridged, cassette-tape version if you can; you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The brokaw book is noteworthy in that he praises people from many diferent walks of life for thier WWII contributions. The only comment aboutthis book is that it is not writen by an author but sounds like an author reading from a teleprompter."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman, but like an awestruck, hero-worshipping kid. That's not a crime, but one expects more from a man with Brokaw's experience and training. I felt the text was very shallow -- especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities. One doesn't learn a lot in this section. Nor does one get any meaningful insights. I also felt there was a tremendous &quot;sameness&quot; about the interviews. Surely, there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views. Brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two. Regrettably, one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me, belonging to the post-war generation, it reads as a very shallow &quot;hurra-patriotism&quot; story, without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers. Not everything this generation did was so great and I would have expected from a critical journalist like Tom Brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well. In this sense it is not very demanding book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Like so many other readers, I too, am the daughter of a World War II vet. Dad didn't really talk about the war when I was young, and if he did, it was more about where he served. Dad was a medic with the US Navy in the South Pacific. Guam, Oakinowa, and Saipan, were a few places where he was stationed. Anyway, he never talked about the horrors that he saw until recently when both the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; came out. It was through the reading of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; (and yes, seeing, &quot;Private Ryan&quot;) that I finally understood why Dad couldn't talk about the war. Mostly, I came to appreciate Dad, his generation, and their controbutions to WW II. I even understood him a little bit more than I did before. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It was very well written and thought provoking. I think that this book should be required reading for everyone because it shows just why the controbutions the WW II generation were so important, and how they continue to affect us today."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"An interesting concept containing a series of stumbling blocks that impede the reader's progress down the Brokaw path. Examples: In dealing with both the Womens Army Corps (WAC) and the United States Army Air Corps, Brokaw consistently mis-names the units. The Army Air Corps was NOT the Army Air Force. The WAC began with the WAAC - Womens Army Auxillary Corps- which converted (with the necessity of WAAC members being sworn into the Army), and became the Womens Army Corps. Brokaw consistently and incorrectly refers to it as the WACs -both in the text and in the index on page 412 of the book. I also wondered how the editor had managed to ignore the structure of a sentence on page 190... &quot;Lieutenent Settle spent the rest of the war supervising medical technicians at the hospital with no difficulties.&quot; My flow of reading was too often impeded by technical error."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"The greatest generation -- without a doubt. Unfortunately, the book is not so great. It is a set of stories that all start sounding the same. The author adds very little insight to the stories. Ok, nice story, but what does it all mean? All we get are cliched observations about patriotism and work ethic. I could have reached these conclusions myself, without even reading the stories -- what value does Brokaw add? Additionally, his left-leaning bias comes through (contrast the tone in the sections on Bush, Dole and Weinberger with the ones on Inouye or Cutler). The issues of this generation, what made them great, and what led the baby boom generation that they raised so far off the track have huge potential for discussion. This book doesn't even scratch the surface of any of these issues. Instead, it is a set of similar sounding anecdotes which, though inspiring, you will forget 5 minutes after you read them. Analysis, what there is of it, is incredibly shallow and hopelessly cliched. On top of that, we are subjected to Brokaw heaping praise on his cronies and showing his liberal bias. I have the utmost respect for the WWII generation and what it accomplished, but this book doesn't do their story justice. A quick and forgettable read."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I would have thought it universal among the baby boomer generation that one day we all would realize that our fathers were better men at 16 than we were at 30. Now that I am 45, I am beginning to see that perhaps my intuition was too broad based. Few of my peers ever really left the embarrassingly immature views espoused during the sixties in the sixties where they belong.Tom Brokaw is absolutely right in characterizing &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. Had he managed to do so in an objective manner, the book would have weathered it's poor editing more handily. As it is, Brokaw's apparent inability to not project his own politics into a story is as pronounced here as it is on the Clinton Administrations favorite propaganda outlet, the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.Take the good with the bad-there are moments even Brokaw cannot spoil for us. For a more useful look at the &quot;greatest&quot; generation and the true mettle of our nations resolve and courage, I would suggest &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; is a good place to start.Jerry Furland, Author of &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"This unimaginably hyperbolic sack of tripe has as its premise the single most asinine argument ever made by a network anchor, which is no small feat. It is sort of the literary equivalent of Leni Reifenstahl's Triumph of the Will. Let me make it clear that I yield to noone in my admiration for the men who fought in WWII. Anyone who fights honorably in his nation's service is deserving of our respect and our thanks. But here are a few of the questions that are necessarily raised by Mr. Brokaw's treacly hyperbole:*The first generation of Americans settled and subdued an unknown land. The Revolutionary generation created the nation and defeated the world's greatest empire. The Civil War generation saved the Union and freed the slaves. Brokaw's subjects won a war in Northern Africa, France, Italy and the South Pacific. By what stretch of the imagination was their battle vital to the nation's existence?*If there really was a horrible darkness falling on Europe and this generation fought it out of a sense of duty, why did they stay out of the fight for a full two years, until the Japanese attacked us?*Why did they declare war only on Japan at that point, waiting until Hitler declared war on us to return the favor?*Is there any reason to believe that there has ever been a generation of Americans who would have reacted differently to the bombing of Pearl Harbor? Wouldn't every generation of Americans have eagerly sallied forth to crush Nippon? Succeeding generations fought to free South Korea, South Vietnam and Kuwait; does Brokaw really wish to suggest that they would not have fought Tojo?*Is it appropriate to consider this generation the nation's greatest considering the fact that the Armed Forces were segregated and that we interred our own American Japanese population during the war?*How difficult a task was it to win WWII? With Japan failing miserably in its desperate gamble at Pearl Harbor and the German offensive grinding to a halt in Russia, was there any way that we could have failed to win the war or wasn't this merely a mopping up operation, however costly?*Having freed half of Europe, why did this generation abandon the Eastern half of the continent to the ministrations of Stalin and the USSR? Do the dead of the gulag really feel comforted by the fact that America allowed them to be murdered by Stalin and not Hitler?*Did this generation's responsibilities cease on V-J Day? Besides the question of the Soviet Union, where was this generation during the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, etc? Were they responsible for these failures or merely unsupportive of our soldiers during them?*Do the difficulties of the Depression and service in WWII really justify the massive transfer of payments that this generation has secured to themselves from future generations? Social Security, Medicare, etc. are justly called entitlements; why is this generation the one in our history that felt entitled to so much in exchange for their service to the nation?*Do they bear no responsibility for the enormous deficits that were rung up throughout their lifetimes, in order to pay for the thorough Social Safety Net they demanded? Deficits, mind you, which our generation will be the one to pay off over the next twenty or thirty years.*Who is responsible for the tremendous cultural damage that their Baby Boom children have done and are doing to this country? Wasn't it this &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; that raised the most spoiled, selfish, over indulged crop of brats ever to walk the face of the Earth?Now Brokaw does treat many of these subjects--including interviews with Japanese Americans and blacks--but does not even consider others and its obviously impossible to answer or justify most of them.In the end, what we're left with are some interesting oral histories, like the reminiscences of George Bush and Julia Child, that add fairly little to the prior work of folks like Studs Terkel (The Good War : An Oral History of World War Two &amp; Hard Times : An Oral History of the Great Depression), unified by a thesis that is completely risible.GRADE: D+"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"&quot;Shrapnel in the Heart,&quot; Laura Palmer's biography of Vietnam soldiers based on relics left at the Vietnam memorial in Washington, says it better (and in fewer words) than does Tom Brokaw."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"juvenile, composition is terrible,reads like a high school term paperwhile stories of soldiers and their families can be interestingbrokaw turned this into a chore.it is jumpy, and a lazy selection of other peoples words"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I decided to buy The Greatest Generation 'Kindle Edition' and when I downloaded my purchase, I got instead 'The Greatest Generation SPEAKS'.

The book is not a literary masterpiece, just a compilation of compelling stories about real people and real struggle....a struggle that always results in a sense of pride and responsibility that just doesn't seem to exist today. Some of the book is more interesting than others; Brokaw seems to want to be as politically correct as possible, covering every possible race, creed, and gender.It does, in the final analysis, give the reader insight into the true battles of the 1940's and insight into the spoiled nature of those growing up in the late 20th century."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I read a lot!!!

And they give you a sense of pride in our country. But &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;? In Vietnam, the soldiers were fighting in the dark, They didn't know why they were fighting (this generation did) and the people at home were against them. But they fought brillantly under the most horrendous circumstances. I have a friend who received 2 silver stars, 6 bronze stars, 2 purple hearts (face and leg) and 2 commendations. He was a green beret. He is not considered a hero by the citizens of the United States. A wonderful book, Tom. But come down to earth. The greatest generation was those who fought in Nam.

As I read this book, I could imagine the text as part of a TV news story script complete with old pictures, natural sound, some long pauses in the piece as the camera pushes in or pulls out on the shot. Coupled with the video, these chapters would be powerful. Without the video, they read a bit on the dull side. I can't argue with these people being called the greatest generation but I would argue with those that claim this book as the greatest tribute to the greatest generation"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"I expected more depth and insight into the major themes that drove this generation supported by the individual interviews. I found the book boring and tiring. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"A recent storm in Memphis, TN knocked my power out for 6 days. How fitting that during this period of no air conditioning, Satellite Television or DVDs, one of the books I selected to read was The Greatest Generation. As one generation removed from a family raised on a farm in Missouri, I'm very familiar with the work ethic of my grandparents born around the turn of the century.This book was spectacular! Brokaw weaves his descriptions of what the influences of this generation were, mainly the Depression, with their stories of the war, but also their stories of coming back home and how they lived their lives. Now that they had rescued the world from a tyrant, they came back to America and built a new country filled with conveniences not previously imagined by our rural population.Brokaw does a good job of covering the many different factions of the generation, not just the soldiers. After covering stories of soldiers, he switches gears and covers stories of the women left behind in America and what their lives were like. He also spent a great deal of time covering minorities such as African-American, native Indians, Hispanic, and Japanese Americans. These are fascinating stories and allow the reader to visualize the problems these minorities faced and how they overcame adversity.The most touching chapter for me was the stories of the two girls that married and the husbands immediately were shipped overseas. Both ladies had babies that never met their father. Some of the chapters are just OK but some may bring you to tears as it did me. When I reached one of the final chapters that was titled \\"Famous People\\" it felt inappropriate to read this like these \\"famous people\\" needed a special chapter when the previous chapters had clearly shown the ultimate sacrifices made by real Americans. I debated stopping right there. After a day, I picked the book back up and read through this section and I'm glad I did even though I didn't find these stories as touching. Some of these people had excellent stories of valor also and the fact they are famous should not be held against them as they sacrificed also. And that is the theme of this book; a generation that made the ultimate sacrifice so that the remainder of us could live excellent lives.The fact that this generation of soldiers felt no need to come back and brag about their exploits is really amazing given the \\"me\\" first environment we now find ourselves in. My father-in-law passed away this year and he never mentioned the war although I was aware he was twice wounded in the European effort. So, knowing his days were numbered, I brought the subject up one day in front of his family. He had no problem talking of his exploits but it was really unfulfilling how he described it. It was no longer a big event to him. Just something that happened a long time ago. He was much more interested in the latest football game on television or the four children he raised while working in a blue-collar job.READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN! Recognize the responsibility we have to live to this great standard.Addendum: After rereading some of the negative reviews on this book I'm compelled to at least mention them. It seems the negative reviews fall into journalistic complaints, political dislikes for Brokaw, or jealousy that their generation was not honored. I was actually surprised by the venom directed a the book and there are substantial reviews like this. It does not change my opinion although I certainly honor their beliefs. True, he is not the best writer. But I did not let that limit my emotional attachment to the sacrifices made for some of these people. One writer mentioned watching Saving Private Ryan instead. I have watched that movie repeatedly and feel it is an artistic masterpiece of reflecting the brutality of war.I don't think Brokaw was trying to compare generations. He's just saying that what this generation was called on to do, ie, depression followed by a World War, is deserved of an honor. I am a 49 year old boomer. I do not believe that our generation would be as dedicated to the task although there are massive numbers that would are still there. I'm certainly happy to admit that I'm glad I did not have to fight this type war.I respect everyone's opinion but still felt thrilled to read about the sacrifices made for later generations. I hope to visit Normandy soon and maybe in some way honor this great sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Brokaw delivers a lightweight, sketchy, collection of interviews with World War Two vets, which unfortunately has made him a lot of money and spawned equally mediocre sequels.There are an infinite number of far superior books covering the same ground."},{"Title":"Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Software Engineering and Programming)","review":"The authors wrote better than they knew. My own experience is that reverse engineering is at least 20% of a typical software engineer's typical day. It's the study that a developer puts towards understanding a system well enough to make necessary changes, rediscovering enough about the system to enable the task at hand. The authors addressed their book to specific re-engineering projects, as isolated events, but they really wrote about the everyday life of almost every programmer.As Johnson points out in the foreword, much if the information has an \\"everybody knows that\\" feel about it. I found a few new tips or new phrases, but mostly I found a clear, systematic organization of facts and techniques that are widely applied. The authors' arrangement of known techniques makes them especially valuable, much the way an arrangement of ordinary playing cards can become a valuable hand in poker.Among other things, these authors are the first to convince me that software metrics can be a net gain to a developer. My own, sad exposure to metrics has been normative, a stick wielded blindly in the name of misunderstood \\"quality\\". This book shows how to use metrics in a constructive, exploratory way. The complexity (or whatever) scores are not the output of the process, they are intermediate results to be discarded as soon as they've pointed the way to the real problems.I found only a very few points to disagree with. For example, the authors point out pros and cons of prototypes, but missed the biggest danger of a working prototype: that, no matter what caveats are given, it can be mistaken for a real system. Over-eager clients or managers driven by a false sense of efficiency may demand that the developers just add a feature or two (usually, system's entire capability) and ship it tomorrow. Elsewhere, the authors noted that converting from a command line interface to a GUI can be jarring for users, but did not point out that a GUI can provide a command entry field, at least as a transition aid. I would also have been happier with a longer discussion in ch.10 of type checking - I agree with the authors completely, but feel that they missed some common variations on the type-testing theme and reasons for it.The authors suggested using dot plots for describing similarity between bodies of code, a representation I first saw in genome analysis. It strengthens the image of a program as a living, evolving thing, but also suggests that other genomic tools could possibly have value in understanding software. Programs are really just long strings, and geneticists have a huge box of subtle tools for analyzing long strings. Mating of the two fields could spawn a new generation of techniques for extracting information from existing software.I recommend this book very highly. It's thorough, practical, and readable. It addresses software maintenance - i.e., most of the software industry - as a valuable task, worth serious study and investment in tools. A brief review can't do justice to the book's rich content. I hope you explore it for yourself."},{"Title":"Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Software Engineering and Programming)","review":"If you are charged with reengineering a piece of software; if you are considering rewriting software; or even if you are trying to evaluate whether or not it is worth further effort in maintaining a piece of code: in all of these cases, read this book before you start. Not only will it give you tried and tested advice about the motivations for reengineering, should you then decide that reengineering is necessary, this book provides suggested approaches which will help structure your work and could save you valuable time and effort.Excluding an introductory chapter and an appendix, the book is divided into two sections: Reverse Engineering (Part 1, Chapters 2-5) and Reengineering (Part 2, Chapters 6-10). The first of these sections deals with analysing the code and seeks to answer the question: &quot;Where does one start when presented with a large code base which is a candidate for reengineering?&quot; The patterns presented here help one decide how (or whether) to proceed, help establish confidence in the course of action chosen and give guidance for those worrisome first steps into the unknown. The second section deals with the reengineering itself: testing, migration and restructuring of the code base. Testing ensures that what is re-created reproduces (to the extent desired) the effects produced by the original code base. How do you know that your changes haven't broken the code? Strategies for migration are clearly necessary since we want our new system to be used and evaluated as it is being reengineered. Finally the last three chapters in the book give good, solid, uncontroversial advice about the restructuring of object-oriented code.Presented in an easy-to-read style, the patterns presented in this book should give you a head start in your reengineering endeavours."},{"Title":"Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Software Engineering and Programming)","review":"The authors define a reengineering pattern as one to be globally applied to a large, functioning system that needs to be improved. Their formal definition is \\"Reengineering is the examination and alteration of a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form and the subsequent implementation of the new form.\\" Reasons for improvement could be necessity due to poor performance or just the next iteration of the upgrade cycle where major changes are necessary. In any case, the intent is to perform substantial modifications to the code, generally all the way down to the basic design. Their emphasis is not on converting legacy systems without objects to one that is object-oriented. These patterns are used to convert object-oriented systems into systems that are still object-oriented, but where the implementation is more efficient, either in speed of execution or ease of maintenance. In that sense, the book is timely, as object-oriented programming has now been around long enough that the early systems are beginning to show signs of code rot. Furthermore, our understanding of object-oriented programming has matured a great deal in the past several years, and for many it is time to take advantage of this knowledge.The start point is expected, you begin by setting a general goal, which imposes a generic direction. This involves determining what the inadequacies are perceived to be as well as the expectations for the reengineered product. Once this is done, the next step is a feasibility analysis, which involves the following patterns: Read All the Code in One Hour, Skim the Documentation and Do a Mock Installation. While these patterns are not necessarily to be taken literally, they are very sensible. The source code that currently exists may not be the original, so the most logical first step is to attempt a compilation and install operation. Nothing could tell you more about the seriousness of the potential problems than having an attempted compile fail with a number of errors that exceeds the limits set on the compiler.Assuming that works, the next step is to perform an hour-long scan of the source code. The idea here is not to read it all, but to examine enough of it to get a sense of how well it is put together. This time limit is of course somewhat arbitrary. It may only take you ten minutes to realize that the code was written by deviants. Finally, a cursory examination of the documentation will help you determine if it is to be of any use. This is the point where you must pay the greatest attention, so it may take longer than the other two. Although the documentation may be wonderful, it is necessary for you to read it in conjunction with the associated code, to verify that the two are synchronized. In this case, one may simply want to randomize the examination in some way, and then probe the selected sections in great detail.Once you have performed the previous tests without running away in terror, it is necessary to begin the changes by applying more specific patterns. The first set of specific patterns are used to capture a detailed model of the system, followed by the construction of tests, migration strategies, how to detect duplicated code, redistribute responsibilities, and transform conditionals to polymorphism. The last three are standard refactorings, which shows the movement from general strategies to the more specific. However, the authors are still operating at the system level, so the patterns are more general than refactoring. For example, the patterns on duplicated code are how to identify duplicated code rather than the mechanics of how it is removed.The patterns are described using the structure: The name of the pattern and the problem(s) it addresses, the solution, the list of trade-offs separated into the pros, cons and difficulties; an example, the reasons for applying the pattern and other patterns that are related to it. I found this approach to be refreshing, as many authors give solutions without pointing out the problems their solutions can generate. In general, the patterns form a set of sound advice, but it is up to you to make the transition from the system level to the specifics of code change.If you are faced with a major reorganization of a large project, then I wish you well. However, like these authors I will do more than just give you sympathy and encouragement. My task is much easier, in that I will simply encourage you to read this book. They did all the hard work of constructing a plan, and you would be wise to listen to them.Published in the online Journal of Object Technology, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"\`The Unexpected Way' is a fascinating and thoughtful account of the author's conversion from Budhism to Catholicism, approaching it not only from a personal point of view, but also from a philosophical perspective. He explains what led his to Buddhism in the first place, the important spiritual and philosophical differences between it and Christianity, and why he ultimately decided that the Christian claims and view of life was preferable. In the course of the book he tackles the nature of God in the theistic religions; the nature of the \`self'; animals and reincarnation; the problem of evil; and the claims of a historical Church.Williams is a long-standing Budhist scholar, and his perspective on these issues, while personal, is heartfelt and profound. The book is well written and often humorous. The attractiveness of Eastern religions has never been greater in the west, and anyone interested either in them or in their growing role in western culture would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"Paul Williams has written a masterful account of his conversion to Catholicism. From a unique perspective of being a world authority on Mahayana Buddhism, he compares key aspects of the two religions and offers solid rationale for his choice. The book represents his journey of faith and records his thoughts and experiences as he (re)discovers the Church. The clarity of his thinking and his willingness to offer personal anecdotes and insights make this journey with Dr. Williams extremely rewarding. He includes much relevant philosophy and theology without his writing ever becoming dry or losing the reader's interest. For myself, as a former Buddhist using this book during RCIA, its greatest value is as a work of apologetics -- a coherent, rational, original, convincing, and not to mention quite beautiful argument for and defense of the Christian and Catholic faith, warmly and lovingly written. One need not start from a Buddhist perspective to benefit from Williams' well-reasoned arguments. Anyone who seeks Truth, considers \\"religious\\" questions or enjoys theological or philosophical writing should read this book. Hopefully, that doesn't leave anyone out."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"The intellectual rigor of many Buddhists must be comparable to that of Catholics; that is to say, there are many supposed adherents, but few with the level of knowledge and understanding necessary to any real understanding of their faith. Mr. Williams is the rare bright light in both constellations. His writings on Buddhism are highly respected and continue to be widely read within his narrow discipline.His conversion to Catholicism displays the curiosity and clarity of thought that he brought to his academic ventures in theology and Buddhism as a whole, and The Unexpected Way proceeds with a startling and defining logic. He describes the work as more of an intellectual exercise than an attempt to elucidate the core principles of Catholicism; that is, more an attempt to understand and clarify those principles for himself.In the process he has written a fascinating and, for many, useful account of what had to appear to his friends and colleagues as something of a delusion, rather than merely an unexpected path. In his work, he outlines not only the tenets of the Catholic faith, but the rationale, the intellectual basis for believing in them. He concludes, as he must have known he would, by understanding that while the practice of faith cannot proceed from pure reason or logic alone, faith and reason can be complementary or even symbiotic -- logic and reason can assist one in discerning the truth, but in the end, the truth must be what someone believes. Mr. Williams' truths are ones in which he believes, consistent with his faculties of reason, deduction, inference and consistency. He is a Catholic who walks by both faith and conviction, and his lively and witty account of his unexpected journey to this destination is an example to anyone who attempts to answer life's fundamental question: why there is something, rather than nothing."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"Williams is a recognized expert on Mahayana Buddhism, and practised the Dalai Lama's brand of Tibetan Buddhism for more than 25 years. This book explains his break with Buddhism and conversion to Catholicism. It reads like a series of disconnected meditations - some more intellectually hefty than others - on the whole matter.It seems he was very much a philosophical Buddhist, and not a devotional one - though he has interesting things to say about the Pure Land Buddhism of Shinran. He lands some blows against Buddhism, carefully criticising its incoherent view of reincarnation, its pessimism, and its lack of hope for the believer. His comments on Buddhism are fascinating, and will be of interest to both friends and foes of Buddhism.Less so, his longer remarks on Catholicism. In brief, he's an expert on Buddhism, but very much an amateur at western philosophy and theology. I don't think he'd disagree. But with the zeal of a new convert or a newlywed, he's pretty unimpressed by the considerable difficulties of Catholic doctrine. While he skewers Buddhism on personal identity and life after death, he crows about the \\"magic and mystery\\" of Catholic doctrines like transubstantiation, the incarnation, and the Trinity. And he's a very, very Catholic Christian. With the slight exception of Anglicanism, he can't muster a shard of sympathy for any Protestant approach to Christian thought and life. Still, the book is a good read. It's the story of a man discovering the deep appeal of theism, and of Christianity, in parts, told in endearingly personal terms."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"Paul Williams is a rarity;he's a Buddhist convert to Catholicism.He's very well-spoken,and knows his subject.At the Pacific Zen Center in Santa Rosa,a meditation leader made the observation,\\"Catholics are more open to Buddhist practice than fundamentalists.\\" The Sisters of Mercy in Burlingame engage in Zen meditation.Paul Williams tells his conversion story,then tackles the issues of what set Buddhism&Catholicism; apart.He goes into a fascinating exploration of the issue of reincarnation.Can you have the same \\"self\\" if you are reborn?Rebirth is important to many Buddhists,especially with the choosing of the Dalai Lama,the Panchen Lama,and there are books centered on being reborn well.This book is perfect for Catholics curious about Buddhism,and it's an inspiring conversion story."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"A very interesting and unusual book. Paul Williams was a Buddhism for 20 years, a noted scholar who wrote the standard English text on Buddhism.\\"The Unexpected Way\\" explores the questions that led him away from Buddhism and towards Christianity. Here are the questions that troubled him. First, that the Buddhist believe that a moral order is built into the fabric of the world. Although Williams agreed, he wondered why \\"There is no explanation of why it is\\" (P 42).What plan, Logos, being made the universe this way? Furthermore, if evil exists, what are we to do about it?Buddhist seek retreat from and suppression of desire, even of response. What that right? Buddhist soteriology emphasized avoidence of desire, sensation, and community.In the end, Williams found these questions led him to Christianity."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"This is a great book. I was Jewish and I read this book just from curiosity. It turned me into a complete Christian. This book is just not for Buddists, it will work for any religion. I recommened it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"After reading the book, one would likely have the following impressions: Williams' dissatisfaction with Buddhism is its self-generated individualism; its failure to resolve the issue of something or nothing as lying behind belief where God is dispensable; the turning away from community its practice generates; its rampant subjectivism; reincarnation undermines the uniqueness of a person in one life; and the self-made experiences generated through meditation stand close to egoism.But obviously, as any good Buddhist practitioner would definitely comment: none of the above is true in Buddhism! It is simply because 'individualims, egoism, subjectivism, etc.' are, on the contrary, what a good practitioner practises to let go. If egoism may arise by practising Buddhism, why would there imply a 'denial of a person's uniqueness'? 'Withdrawn from community' is only true for some individual monks but similarly, there are also Catholic monasteries or convents parallel to this aspect in Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism which is the prevalent form of Buddhism certainly does not turn away from the community! It is actually a well-known fact that excelling in Buddhism academically, does not necessarily make a good Buddhist practitioner. But how unfortunate this book would convey so many misunderstandings in Buddhism to the Catholics."},{"Title":"Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism","review":"Stories of conversion have a long history in the Christian tradition, and some of these accounts are among my all-time favorites, e.g., St. Augustine's \\"Confessions,\\" Thomas Merton's \\"The Seven Storey Mountain,\\" and Fr. Seraphim Rose's \\"Not of this World.\\" In my opinion, Paul Williams' \\"The Unexpected Way\\" falls well short of those classic spiritual autobiographies.Although there are occasional biographical and anecdotal asides from Williams' daily life, most of the book consists of Williams' philosophical arguments in defense of Catholic Christianity and against the Mayahana Buddhism which he practised for most of his adult life. Thus we find a rehash of the traditional arguments for the existence of God, arguments for the survival of the human personality after death, arguments against reincarnation, arguments for the resurrection of Jesus, and so forth. Insofar as Williams is a philosopher by profession, this didactic style is perhaps to be expected, but since I myself was a philosophy major in college, much of this has a \\"been there, done that\\" quality for me. Quite frankly, I often found my mind wandering when reading this book. Perhaps it will have greater immediacy for those who aren't accustomed to philosophical debate, and for whom disputation of these ideas represents a new experience.Williams is far less succesful in making Christianity seem alive and vibrant than Merton, Chesterton, or C.S. Lewis did in their day, and I would refer readers to those authors for conversion stories and/or Christian apologetics that are far more engaging.Moreover, in defending traditional Catholic doctrines, Williams often falls back upon appeals to ecclesiastical authority rather than engaging in a real critique to see how well those doctrines are grounded in scripture and whether new understandings are possible. The efforts of men like Thomas Merton and Bede Griffiths to revisit old teachings in the light of new knowledge seem antithetical to Williams' approach. As a new convert, he does not want to rock the boat."},{"Title":"On Ghost Trails","review":"From the shocking prologue right up to the etherial end, there are numerous surprises all along the way.

This simple, down-to-earth book explains what it is, its history, how it works and it offers the reader an introduction to the basic ritual work.It investigates the sources of the Western tradition and the roots of Hermeticism. The authors' account of the history of the Order of the Golden Dawn and its colourful founders is very thorough and makes for engaging reading.The book clearly illustrates the principles and philosophies of high magick and explains its laws in a straightforward manner. In addition, it covers all of the various areas of magkical knowledge and provides plenty of Golden Dawn rituals for the newcomer.I also recommend Israel Regardie's Garden Of Pomegranates: Skrying On The Tree Of Life, edited and annotated by Chic Cicero and Sandra Tabatha Cicero. This is a classic work on the Qabalah for the more advanced student.As an alternative to the Golden Dawn tradition, I recommend the book Foundations Of High Magick by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips. This is the best work explaining the theory and practice of Art Magick, the venerable Ogdoadic tradition which differs markedly from the Golden Dawn.The Essential Golden Dawn contains several appendices, a glossary of terms, an extensive bibliography and a thorough index."},{"Title":"The Essential Golden Dawn: An Introduction to High Magic","review":"Be careful!

If you're at all familiar with the subject, you'll find it to be a dull retelling of what so many other authors have already revealed.All told the book does what it set out to do - give a boiled down explanation of this influential group. But it looks at it from so many angles, so briefly, that it can only offer the most superficial treatment of each part. This translates into a very superficial appreciation for the GD.Readers with any familiarity with the subject will be dissapointed.

More importantly, it not only dispells any misconceptions about ISO 9001 by providing up-to-date information about the 2000 version versus the gaps in earlier versions.What I like most about this book is the way the author systematically leads you through the basics, including the history, goals and benefits of ISO 9001 registration, and shows how this standard has been greatly improved in the 2000 version. Chapter 2, in particular, imparts the key differences of this version, and thoroughly discusses the relevance of the 90003 recommendations in the document set to software development.Chapter 3 is where this book segues from background to practical application, starting with an implementation strategy. This chapter outlines an implementation approach and lays the groundwork for the subsequent chapters that cover each of the major clauses in the quality management system. As in the first two chapters the author clearly shows how ISO 9001 aligns to the unique and specific needs of a software development organization. He provides all of the information necessary to understand what is needed to conform to each clause, and presents the information in a manner that makes sense. One especially nice feature of this book is the liberal use of tables and charts, which summarize information and make sorting out the critical elements easy.Among the strongest chapters are Chapters 7 (Product Realization Requirements) and 8 (Measurement, Analysis and Improvement Requirements). The reason I found these so useful is the material can also be applied to ITIL service level management requirements, or as a standalone framework for IT-to-business alignment. This expands the scope of this book beyond software development. In addition, any IT service provider-not just ISVs and other development organizations-can apply this book's approach to achieving ISO 9001 compliance.Chapter 9 is especially valuable to organizations that are pursuing ISO 9001 registration because it takes a due diligence approach to identifying potential registrars, then steps you through the registration process. If you are not pursuing registration, but are using this book to implement portions of ISO 9001 as the foundation of a quality initiative, the material in this chapter on auditing is still useful. Another key feature of this book is the appendices and the artifacts provided on the accompanying CD ROM. The appendices include a quality manual outline, forms and templates, and audit questions.Although this book is aimed at software development organizations interested in, or pursuing, ISO 9001 registration, it also provides invaluable material for any IT organization (internal or service provider). If you are working with or implementing ITIL this book will also prove to be an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This book is the Bible of Technical analysis.Technical analysis is a financial markets technique that claims the ability to forecast the future direction of security prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume.In its purest form, technical analysis considers only the actual price and volume behavior of the market or instrument, on the assumption that price and volume are the two most relevant factors in determining the future direction and behavior of a particular stock or market.Technical analysts may employ models and trading rules based, for example, on price and volume transformations, such as the relative strength index, moving averages, regressions, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, cycles or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.Technical analysis is widely used among traders and financial professionals, but is considered in academia to be pseudoscience.Academics such as Eugene Fama say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the weak form of the generally-accepted efficient market hypothesis.Economist Burton Malkiel argues, \\"Technical analysis is an anathema to the academic world.\\" He further argues that under the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, \\"...you cannot predict future stock prices from past stock prices.\\"However, there are also many stock traders who proclaim technical analysis not as a science for predicting the future but instead as a valuable tool to identify favorable trading opportunities and trends. The assumption is that all of the fundamental information and current market opinions are already reflected in the current price and when viewed in conjunction with past prices often reveals recurring price and volume patterns that provide clues to potential future price movement.In the foreign exchange markets, its use may be more widespread than fundamental analysis. While some isolated studies have indicated that technical trading rules might lead to consistent returns in the period prior to 1987, most academic work has focused on the nature of the anomalous position of the foreign exchange market.It is speculated that this anomaly is due to central bank intervention."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Not comprehensive or outlined or organized.

For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern, there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician, out of necessity of his methodology, is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels, but more often than not, those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings, price, book value, growth, forward earnings, debt levels, etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation, but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also, anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets. Lacking a material event (earnings release, management shake-up, etc.) a company's price will largely be pulled around in lock-step w/ the broader market.These are known as the facts.

It is written like a textbook with topics addressed in logical order. This book covers detailed descriptions and analysis of many traditional chart patterns and some attendant trading strategies. Numerous examples are given in annotated charts. Technical terms are defined and explained.In the ninth edition (2007), Appendix E contains a Turtle Trading System manual written by Curtis Faith (one of Richard Dennis' original Turtles) - a dated but nevertheless instructional description of a mechanical trading system.Though this book is a great educational tool, I feel it would be a mistake to take it all literally as a guide to trading. The original author, Magee, last updated the book in 1966. He goes out on a limb regularly in his advice on how certain patterns 'typically' resolve. The probabilities with which his rules apply to today's markets would undoubtedly vary from pre-1966 markets. William J. O'Neil, in his renowned How to Make Money in Stocks (2009, p.-146), said that many patterns discussed by Edwards & Magee such as triangles, coils and pennants have, in recent times, shown to be \\"unreliable and risky\\" patterns \\"without sufficient time or price correction to become proper bases.\\"I found the book a frustrating slog to get through because Magee uses a very formal, wordy and repetitive writing style. In the eighth and ninth editions professor Bassetti has added numerous editor's notes and extra chapters to the original, but frequently uses awkward, incomplete sentences to belabor the obvious. More annoying were Bassetti's repeated attempts to be clever, e.g. p.- 415: \\"The wild frontier of the Internet and of the gunslinger speculators. Amazon bucks on. Give us a slug of rotgut whiskey and get out the ruler\\", or \\"one might almost say awesome, if the word were not in such currency on \`Saturday Night Live' and the \`Comedy Channel'\\". This sort of running commentary gets tiring after 800 pages."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This is a technical analysis book, focus on price pattern. If you are looking for RSI, MACD, etc, look else where. This book covers topics such as Symmetric Triangle, Gaps, Resist/support, etc. They are very detailed and I definitely learn a lot from this book.If you want to buy this book, my advice is to buy an earlier edition (5th). The additional chatpers written by Bassetti simply doesn't match the quality of Edwards and Magee. For example, he uses internet stocks, such as Amazon or Cisco, to illustrate his point of dramatic/speculative crash. However, he uses charts which are unadjusted for split. If Amazon split 3-1, then there will be a big gap. The gap doesn't mean anything technically. He devotes an entire chatper to discuss false gaps like that! Very disturbing and unintelligent.The original writers aer superb though. I strongly recommand this book for people who wants to learn the price pattern/action. If John Murphy's book is like an encyclopedia of Technical Analysis, then this book focus mainly on the subject of price pattern."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"If you want a copy of the original 1940s edition, that is what this is.

Magee and Edwards do an excellent job explaining Dow Theory and stock chart analysis. I bought the 5th edition because it was the last edition that was actually edited by the original authors. This book is the source of most modern technical analysis theory. It covers reversal patterns, gaps, support and resistance, consolidation patterns, trendlines and channels (by Edwards); and then goes into stock selection, stop orders, how to build a chart, and the practical application of those patterns and how to use them in your trading (by Magee).

Bassetti.Bassetti's main objective in his edits is to try to impress the reader with how intelligent he is - in particular how large his vocabulary is and how clever he can be in his writing. Unfortunately I did not buy this book to find out how intelligent, clever, and articulate the editor is. I bought this book to learn classic chart patterns as taught by Edwards and Magee. Bassetti's annoying and low value edits detract from this great work. Bassetti has truly mastered the art of saying in six sentences with fancy words and pointless historical references what could much more easily and effectively be said in one sentence with regular words. The contrast between Edwards and Magee's to the point writing style and Bassetti's grandiose rhetoric is remarkable.I hope the publisher reads this review and finds a better editor for the next edition. You will see other people making similar comments below. Also notice below that Bassetti reviews his own book and gives it five stars.

Initially, when I started learning technical analysis I had the question that whether these classical technical analysis method works in today's internet oriented market. To my surprise after reading Professor Bassetti's comments on last dot com bust, it made me realized that same techniques still works. Moreover, I think this book can only be understood by the experienced trader and not by the new traders. If you see other experienced trader's book recommendation list you will find this book in there. It takes time to get to a level when this book start to make real change in one's understanding/trading. That's what I make of it. Initially, I myself did not understand many concepts what this book talks about. Now as I am getting more and more experienced and it stats to add value to my trading. Recently I experienced up and down of google and aaple live in action. And if you refer to the book then it make sense how still market works in the same fashion as it worked a decades ago, even though most of the trading is done by computers these days. For a new readers of this book, I would suggest don't give up easily keep. Read it a number of times and get some real experience with live trade not the paper trading.As a student of Professor Bassetti, I have seen his experienced analysis at several occasion works perfectly live in action.

Charts are always open to interpretation but a master trader who trades everyday can eyeball charts and interpreted them a lot better. Haven't you noticed in everyday life the most skillful people who have the most knowledge come from family generations who did the same business.You need to work at it to be just as skillful in any business since making profits in a stockmarket does not come easy at first.What you see is the same type of stock patterns that your Grandpa would have seen if he traded stocks. These price patterns are like road signs you should be able to visualize them on any chart regardless what time-frame. Not knowing stock patterns when they are completed is like driving through stop signs. After you have read this book you should be very skillful in drawing trend lines,channel lines, and identifying trends on any chart. Even today using a newer stock symbol you see the same old basic chart patterns occur as the old fashioned charts a century ago. No oscillators or momentum-based indicators are needed on your chart. Experience is your best teacher when you look at chart patterns and there are many more to identify that you discover on your own.

It is clearly a better reference work than text and should not be used as a text by a raw beginner."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"If Edwards and Magee wrote the bible of technical analysis in 1948 when they first published \\"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends.\\" then why do we need a Ninth Edition of their classic? This question was foremost in my mind as I began reading this recently released version of a book I spent many hours with as I prepared for the CMT exams. After reading all 832 pages, I realized that in many ways, the financial markets, and technical analysis, are finally maturing to the point where we can fully grasp the significance of what was first written almost sixty years ago. With a focus on pragmatic portfolio theory, editor Charles Bassetti significantly contributes to the technical analysis body of knowledge especially related to tactics, and has created a book worth a space on every technician's bookshelf.In this edition, Bassetti delivers much more than an update - it's actually a new book. He focuses on strategies for increasing profits:* The basics of traditional chart analysis are clearly presented, just as Robert Edwards meant for them to be. In keeping with the practice of earlier editions, Bassetti retains the original charts showing examples of patterns from the 1940s and earlier. He also includes more than two dozen new charts, demonstrating that the same old patterns still work today. The detailed discussion of the market psychology that forms these patterns may stimulate modern analysts to program the patterns.* Adds a comprehensive explanation of Magee's \\"basing points\\" procedure for setting initial and trailing stops on any position. Bassetti adds a chapter and charts to clarify this powerful concept, which in itself is worth more than the cost of the book.* For what may be the first time, Bassetti provides an annotated chart of the Dow, combining an in-depth discussion of Dow Theory with a visual history of the signals. We've all seen tables showing the sell signal in Oct 1929 or the buy signal in late-1990 which lasted more than seven years, but the chart erases any doubt that Dow Theory is a valuable timing tool. Creating a comprehensive source on the Dow Theory, he also includes an overview of Robert Colby's method to automate the signals.* Provides a link to www.edwards-magee.com, which offers downloadable material that supplements the text. As one example, readers can download pdf files of the Dow Theory signals for closer examination.* Offers new perspectives on short-term and futures trading. The extensive new material on commodity trading, including a complete trading plan, was not addressed in previous editions.Bassetti also ensures the reader understands the similarities between Magee's Sensitivity Index and Modern Portfolio Theory's Beta; and the striking resemblance of Magee's Composite Leverage to the financial engineering concept of Value at Risk. Readers of previous editions may not have realized that Magee developed these concepts decades before Nobel Prize-winning work was undertaken in these areas. Magee wrote in the language of the trader (semi-log charts), rather than the academician and his ideas have been overlooked by economic theorists.A classic book is one that stands the test of time. No one can argue that Technical Analysis of Stock Trends fails in this regard. Patterns that worked a hundred years ago are still found in financial markets and they still work. The forecasting ability of patterns lies in their ability to document the history of human nature, which remains unchanged over many centuries.Another feature of classic works is a unique style. Edwards and Magee filled their work with examples - current at the time of publication. They wrote with clarity and ease of style not usually found in textbooks. Their text was a practical \\"how to\\" manual that explained the \\"study of the action of the market itself\\" in concrete terms. It appealed to those seeking the Holy Grail on Wall Street, and to those serious students of the markets seeking an edge. In this new edition, Bassetti retains all of their style and introduces his own, which in all ways is similar to the original, but with a modern edge.Bassetti believes that Magee's concept of basing points is worth a great deal of additional study. This is one of the most significant contributions he makes to the new edition, updating this section in the tactics to ensure that all traders understand this method of stop placement. His example is clear, and the reader can instantly implement this technique, which Bassetti thinks of as one of the most valuable in the book.Some question whether classical chart reading is still a valid discipline in an era defined by cheap data, powerful scanning and backtesting software, instantaneous execution and quantitative analysis. After reading this book, you'll be left with a deeper appreciation of the value of chart reading and will become an even stronger proponent of technical analysis in modern markets."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This is a review of the 9th edition. Please note that amazon has included this review for other editions as well. That is okay because I have something to say about them too, but you should be aware. The really old editions are probably out of copyright.I would not recommend this book unless you are into the \\"history of technical analysis\\". The focus of the book is classical patterns of bar charts. The book is absolutely not bad, but it's value is a bit dubious. Why read a book that have charts that are 1/2 century old? You can't be sure that things haven't changed, can you? So the newer editions also have more modern charts. However, this combination of old and new makes for a frustrating reading. Actually I would think most book deteriorate in quality after their 3rd edition.If you want a classic in your bookself I would really recommend you to buy a second-hand copy of the last edition written by Edwards & Magee alone. This would be the 5th edition. It has a very professional binding and clear white pages. The new edition is a very ugly and cheaply bound hardcover. This comment is only if you are into good looking books. You get the 5th edition for $5 at amazon, so it is a nobrainer!Addition in 2010: Edwards and Magee wrote a classic that has many editions. I bought one copy around 1984 and it was the first book in technical analysis that I read. I liked it a lot. With time other books have been written, but I still like this old book. Now mainly because it is a very pretty book. Expensive paper and a proper spine that will never break. It feels nice to touch. I value nice books if their content is classic. I bought the 9th edition just out of curiosity and I am displeased by it. There is a running commentary in sections by a new third author - the original authors long dead. The commentary is ridiculous. At one point he decides to call an upside down head-and-shoulder pattern for a kilroy patterns. Hello? We don't need comments on this level. The paper and binding is ugly (but not as bad as books from Wiley Finance - please use better paper in your expensive books!). So on all accounts a ** book.

It was the first comprehensive work on technical analysis, at a time when technical analysis was considered an abstract art rather than a true science. It is so complete in its descriptions of the markets and how to trade them, that it has survived the greatest test of the literary world - time. It is without peer when described as the Bible of Technical Analysis. Anyone who is interested in market history, or the history of technical analysis, should read this amazing work. And anyone who is considering studying technical analysis or actually trading using TA, is also highly encouraged to not just read, but devour, this book. Now, Darwin was known for describing the process of evolution, and his attention would have been greatly stimulated by the world of technical analysis. This book was the first, but by no means the last. Mr. Murphy's Technical Analysis of the Futures Market and Mr. Schwager's Complete Guide to the Futures Market are powerful additions to the rishness and wealth of information in the world of TA.

I honestly think the book by Bruce Kamich, \\"How Technical Analysis Works\\" or John Murphy's \\"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets\\" are better choices for the beginning student.

More than six decades and nine editions later, Robert Edwards and John Magee's Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is still considered the gold standard of technical analysis based trading. The current 9th edition has been updated to stay relevant in the current environment.The editor starts off with an introduction on how he went about adapting this classic. However, it quickly jumps into a lot of theoretical trending information with very detailed coverage of the Dow Theory from the basic theory to specific examples in the past. The authors then discuss various trends including my favorite the Head and Shoulder trend line to help you predict which direction a stock will move based on past data. Several examples (over 200) are introduced to make sure the reader has understood this concept. I really liked that the editor pointed out the uncertainty with following such a trend system but at the same time promoting its benefits. The authors also outline the different strategies (options- either put or call) based on the predicted movement of a particular stock.The second half of the book is devoted to specific tactics that can be utilized during different market conditions. Essentially, the authors break up the different theories into ways that you can apply them. For example, if you are deciding to invest in an energy sector company during a bear market with a Triangular Trend pointing to an upwards movement in price, you can navigate through to figure out the various metrics you need to chart (P/E ratio, revenue, profits, etc) in order to determine the optimal time to invest and the investment tool (stock versus option). The authors also devote a short time to explaining similar trending patterns and tactics in the commodity market.Overall, I have mostly positive things to say about this book. However, this book is more useful as sort of an instructional manual when trading stocks. If this is your first time investing I would not recommend reading this book. Instead, get something like Stock Trading for Dummies, so that you can be familiar with all various investment terminology. Then, open an investment simulator account for free using Investopedia or a similar platform and as you start reading this book practice the tactics on your simulated investments. Keep referring to the book as you make decisions about your portfolio. The tactics in the book, although they might seem technical at first, are actually very easy to chart using Google Finance, Morningstar, or similar. So, hold on to this book as a reference so that you can finally start making data driven decisions instead of just trading based on a stock tip from your buddy!"},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"4 stars for the volume of thoroughly well researched examples and exhaustive coverage of basic patterns.This book is comprehensive but not complete.

The authors claim that all a trader really needs to know is found in the charts. Fundamentals can be tossed aside. You just need to know how to interpret what the chart is saying and then act by taking a position.But does this approach work? This will depend on the individual. For example, you and I can trade the same stock for 3 years applying technical analysis but the end result can very well be that one of us ends up with a big profit and the other a big loss. The reason is due to the following factors: which patterns to take, the spot where you get in, how far to let a position move against you, and where to take a profit. As you can see, technical analysis is somewhat subjective.You probably know that there are no guarantees in the trading game. And chart formations are NOT infallible. All the stuff taught in this book will short circuit at one time or another causing a loss. You could even fall into a losing streak. Thankfully, the authors give fair warning about the dangers involved. But despite the unpleasant prospects, this book remains one of the very best places to learn the theory of technical analysis of charts. I recommend going with the 4th or 5th edition, that is all you really need to capture the essence of the material, plus, you'll save yourself a few bucks."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"If you're reading this then you're probably skimming the reviews of this book in order to figure out if you should buy this book. The answer is yes. From what I, as a beginner, can tell, this book seems to be exactly what the other reviewers are calling it, _the_ traders bible.As with any bible, if you are going to take short term trading seriously, (which you most certainly should), this book should not only be read, but carefully studied, and it's teachings analyzed and followed."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"I believe serious students of the market's action should master this book in its edited form whether they intend to specialize in the technical action or not. Wealthy clients have been known to blow out from ignorance of basic technical action in the financial marketplace.The edited form (TAST 8) has information of value for the beginner as well as for an experienced practitioner. The present editor has provided an excellent review of Dow Theory in chap 5.1 and presents arguments for traders trying to resolve the identity dilemma in chap 18.1. Money management principles have also been included in the text which I think are the most critical aspect of the trading enterprise. Basing points are central to the method and the editor has included a discussion about their use.As a student & associate of the editor I can't recommend the 8th Edition enough and I think the dissenting views posted by \\"the reader without a name\\" should be ignored as unfounded and largely ignorant of the contributions from the present editor. An examination of several of that critic's other reviews shows this to be the case."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"The book is a reprint of a much older book. Since the original book was written there have been a number of significant advances in computing power and software and this book is very much dated."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"I still havn't finished this but what i have studied has been of great help in identifying chart patterns and warning me off otherwise recommended stocks. This edition in particular seems to be the ultimate edition to own as the later editions get away from the original authors' intentions."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Informative and a very good resource tool when I need it. Easy to read narration which is a feature when the content can be a little dull at times."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"I did without this book for many years. Now I wonder how I managed and how much easier things would have been. Timing decisions are much easier when you can identify what is taking place and have a firm idea of the trends and signals of the markets. This is the Bible of Technical Analysis."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"The legendary financial adviser and newsletter writer Harry Schultz told me to get this book as the &#34;bible&#34; of technical chart analysis and so I did. Clearly he was right."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Great Book. I learned to hand chart over 40 yrears ago using this book as a reference. Teaches technical analysis to traders. This is my 3rd copy (I loan it out too much). At the age of 78 I still enjoy reviewing the subject matter!"},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This is one of the best books on trading ever written! The book contains two parts. In the first part you learn the theory of technical analysis such as price and volume action. In the second part you do practice. I know a lot of books that give you just fundamentals without saying how to apply those fundamentals in practice. This book is a perfect exception! Authors did a great job! Though a book has been written in 1940s, it still remains in print and contains valuable insights into how market really works. The only chapter that I would exclude from the book is chapter about trading in futures which has been added to this edition of the book. You can tell by reading this chapter that the language is different, more difficult to comprehend and tells a lot of different indicators that you don't even need to know. So, skip that chapter and enjoy the rest of the book!"},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is considered to be the Bible of Technical Analysis. I would revise that to say that it's the Bible of chart pattern analysis, because it doesn't go into modern technical analysis methods (indicators etc.). At any rate, it's a comprehensive book on classical technical analysis (that being chart patterns).The main down sides to this book are that it's a dry read and it lacks an evidence-based approach. What I mean by that last part is that many times the authors simply say \\"in our opinion this is so\\" or \\"in our experience we find that this happens.\\" That really equates to a focus group of one and can be a recipe for causality errors/confusion. You're essentially left with having to take the authors word for it.At any rate, it's an in-depth, detailed review of chart patterns, thus a valuable resource for those interested in an in-depth study of TA. But, I wouldn't base my investment decisions based solely on this book and it's not the only book that I would use to study TA."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Written in the 20's, this book is at least five decades ahead of its time, discussing detailedly about Dow Theory, chart patterns, volume, support and resistance etc in the demand and supply context, at a time whilst most people focused solely on company/accounting data specific fundamental analysis. However, though market psychology doesnt change, technology and the speed and means of information distribution do, leading to shorter business cycles and thus trends, inevitably attacking the weakest link of the Dow Theory which is that confirmation of the primary and long term trend almost always come too late. The situation is even worse in that &quot;traps&quot; in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. Nevertheless, considering the high price of the book and the long time to read it through, there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a very exhaustive reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA. The new appendix of MACD, Stochastics etc is adequate but far from sufficient. Afterall, TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This book is simply indespensible, if one is serious about his trading. I have been trading for about 4yrs now. And only purchased the book because its a pre-requiste for CFT exams.I am amazed at how its has changed my prespectives towards trade managment.Again an absolute must if you want to commit funds trading in a relaxed & profitable manner.I am quite sure that the LORD, could have bestowed his Grace on Magee, and placed him in paradise because of it.GOD REST HIS SOUL."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"I read Edwards and McGee, Technical Analysis of Stock Market Trends with great enthusiasm. Here was a book that was originally written in the 1940's that is equally valid to anyone trying to play the stock market in the Twenty First Century. It also gave me insights into the wild times on Wall Street in the Roaring 20's, and taught me how the pros did stock manipulation and organized &quot;bear traps.&quot; Understanding Wall Street irrational exuberance in 1928 helps a smart investor understand the irrational exuberance in 1999. I started reading and then using Technical Analysis because I found I couldn't make money on the market just using the fundamental analysis that my accounting professors taught me in business school. I bought stocks based on detailed analysis of the firm's fundamentals and then could not understand why the prices of my &quot;smart&quot; investments immediately dropped like a rock. Technical analysis provides an investor with insights into the market forces (supply and demand) that affect the rise and fall of stock prices and give a rational investor understanding of the psychology of the herd of investors.Modern web technology available from Clearstation and E-trade take the drudgery out of the technical charting, and make it easy for an amateur investor to become an experienced technical chart reader. Edwards and McGee was the book that helped me develop this skill. I can not praise the authors of this book enough."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"The simple indicators that TAST presents can easily be applied to intraday movements, indicators powerful enough that, with an understanding of the story behind the stock and the market environment, are all one needs to trade. Yes, it takes awhile to read this book, as any dense textbook or reference work would. It's worth every minute and penny to study this manual."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Edwards and Magee is considered one of the bibles of technical analysis. While it covers the basics well (head and shoulders tops, etc.), the shear number of not so well known patterns can be overwhelming. I would doubt most people could (or would) finish this book. It's more of a reference book. John Murphy's Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets is a much better choice. Murphy covers trendlines, patterns, stochastics, Elliot Wave, money management and a host of other technical topics. Don't be fooled by its title -- it's quite applicable to stocks."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This is a textbook, and as such, the reader should not expect to be able to breeze through it. I read it over the course of a month, highlighting the most important points with a yellow marker, just as I did my textbooks in college. The effort was well worth it. I now feel that I have a practical basis upon which to evaluate the chart of any stock. I know when to buy, when to sell and when to sit and wait. My investing strategy is 1000% better than it was a year ago, and I owe it all to this book."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"There are three major, critical tech analysis books.The first one is John Murphy's.The second is this one. It is well worth your time.The last one is Bruce Kamich's \\"How tech analysis works.\\"If you read any of these -- or better yet, all 3 -- you WILL have a firm grasp on why charts are important and how charts are properly read.....Again, these are the only 3 charting books you need as they are the most comprehensive...."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"If you're interested in technical analysis (one of the reviewers wasn't, so he gave the book a bad rating), this is the book to start with.Sure, it's dense. But it's the BEST technical analysis book out there. Start with this one. Read it each year of your investment career, and you'll be very happy that you did.(by the way, I own comparable books by bulkowski, Murphy and Schwager, but they don't compare in the level of depth and usefulness of this book)"},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"This is a book good for beginners, but for intermediate level traders this is definitely not a good choice. This book cover too little on moving average, RSI and other indicators. Also, the graph in this book is almost all hand drawn, make it very hard to read."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"Good book, if you really want to learn stock analysis. It gets you thinking for yourself about the movements of stocks. There is no way one can absorb all the information provided within the text. It is a guide and reference for those who want to devote time to stock analysis. I am now more educated on stock trends, but still require the book for periodic refreshers. If you're buying this book for casual reading, find another book. Although very good, this book is very intense and reading it will consume some time. Dedication is required to finish the book, but the potential for success is great, much greater than a lottery ticket."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once observed that it is impossible to step in the same river twice. By that statement he meant, seemingly, that everything is in a state of change. Hence, if Greg Louganis decided to jump off a diving board into the Mississippi River, he would never be able to plunge into the same water molecules more than once. By the time he attempted his second jump, the water which gave way during his first dive would be a long way down the river on its route toward the Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, Heraclitus's analogy, one could argue, is applicable to the study of securities markets: although companies have traded their stock on exchanges for decades, even centuries, the stock markets themselves are always in flux because participants--investors, as well as the companies themselves--are constantly leaving and entering the game. Robert Edwards' and John Magee's classic TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF STOCK TRENDS was written fifty years ago, long before such hallowed American companies as Microsoft, Dell, or Cisco Systems were in existence. Although the stock markets are indeed &quot;rivers of change,&quot; it is clear that this book remains the standard guide for investors and traders who believe that technical analysis is an effective approach to predicting the future behavior of stocks. Modern readers should be aware, however, that too many of the charts in the book are from obscure, even defunct, companies from the 1940's; the appendix &quot;Updated charts through 1996&quot; is helpful but out of place in the back of the book. These charts, rather, should be placed in the text of the book in order to illustrate the book's key principles. Those interested in applying technical analysis to the future markets should also consider Jack Schwager's recent guide to technical analysis. It would seem impossible, though, that those still interested in trading stocks technically could avoid reading Edwards's and Magee's useful volume, a guide that remains a constant in a world of change."},{"Title":"Technical analysis of stock trends,","review":"A lot of timeless insight and wisdom. If you are only looking for the latest and hottest indicator, this book is not for you. It does have a small chapter with definitions of some recent (i.e. less than 30 years old) oscillators, but it mostly discusses area patterns like gaps and head and shoulders (the first edition was written in late forties). On the other hand, it's amazing how timeless the simple (in a Zen sense) market wisdom and insight is. Like &quot;Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator&quot;, this book gives you more than a new spreadsheet formula -- it gives you deeper understanding of the nature of the Market.On the other hand, I think you shouldn't use this book as your first TA course -- you'll probably wish to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. The book's subtle points will be lost on you, while you'll be angered and frustrated by anachronisms. On the other hand, if you know the TA basics and are looking for refining your understanding, the same old charts and anachronisms (i.e. calling Dow Jones Transportation Index &quot;Rails&quot;) can be a welcome way to gain some insight into the history of subject, while enjoying the timeless wisdom of the founding fathers of Technical Analysis."},{"Title":"La Ignorancia","review":"Irena sali&oacute; de Praga despu&eacute;s de la ocupaci&oacute;n sovi&eacute;tica de 1968 rumbo a Paris, en donde vive desde hace 20 a&ntilde;os.

As the authors put it: there are hundreds of common experiences, feelings, situations and even objects which we all know and recognize, but for which no word exists. On the other hand, the world is littered with thousands of spare words doing nothing but loafing about on signposts pointing at places.Douglas Adams - the one of the Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy fame - and John Lloyd have done their best trying to pair the two. Just for the gusto, here's an example of dictionary entry: Wyoming (ptcpl.vb.) Moving in hurried desperation from one cubicle to another in a public lavatory trying to find one which has a lock on the door, a seat on the bowl and no brown streaks on the seat.Although The Deeper Meaning of Liff is significantly expanded in size over the original, I guess I would choose the latter. While The Meaning of Liff mostly covers place names from the Britain, the expansions seem to be predominantly reaching abroad, resulting in somewhat diluted compendium. After all, there is some logic that English place names are fitting best in an English dictionary, isn't it?"},{"Title":"The Meaning of Liff","review":"Monty-python-esque approach to language...this is the British version of what in America are called &quot;sniglets&quot;, little neo-logisms invented for things and situations which don't have proper words to designate them but ought to. The difference is that these creations ala Douglas Adams &amp; John Lloyd use already existing town names in the UK and re-define them to make them useful (and funny)...this is altogether different from American sniglets like &quot;bevemirage&quot; (the black plastic bottom of a liter bottle of dark cola that fools you temporarily into thinking there is more cola left in the bottle than there actually is), which tend to be creative word-fusions of already existing words. The only U.S. linguistic construction I can think of that comes close to what Lloyd and Adams are doing here is the phrase &quot;in a New York Minute&quot;, aka &quot;really fast&quot;. Though there is no collorary such as &quot;in a Topeka minute&quot; (or whatever) to mean slow, drawn out (but maybe there ought to be). I bought this book in the UK for 4.99 GPB, but it seems it's out of print here in the USA, alas. Probably out of print in Britain also.

He writes from a committed Evangelical position, and is not by any means reducing the meaning of scripture to merely human processes or psychology.

I suspect that since the 1820s in France did not have the great celebrity media of TV, press, and print of today, one can question whether Antonin Careme was in any way similar to Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse, and Mario Batali. But, this is probably just an academic quibble with a word in the title, as Careme is as important to the history of modern western (read French) culinary practice than any other figure you can mention, including Escoffier.The greatest delight in reading a book of this type, an interesting history of a period in your field of interest with which you may not be too familiar. There is a little surprise on every page, and a few really big ones. In retrospect, it is almost obvious that to become famous in the culinary field in Napoleonic France, one had to be a patisserie. There were no restaurants. In fact, the book repeats the claim that restaurants were invented by the French Revolution, as the guild system under the Bourbons prevented establishments from selling practically all kinds of food except soup. The Revolution, in seeking to overturn everything associated with the Royal regime, overturned that stricture as well. So, restaurant chefs were not exactly a dime a dozen in Napoleonic Paris. Almost all great chefs were employees of wealthy families, former nobility, or they were pastry chefs, as boulangerie and patisserie were much better established and patisserie offered a medium in which great talent can achieve expression. That is, the centerpieces of great banquets created largely out of sugar and baked shapes.This would make pastry specialists such as Jacques Torres and Ewald Notter the closest modern counterparts to Careme, as both Torres and Notter are leaders in the very specialized field of confectionery sculpture, one in chocolate and one in sugar. This also means that this practice which seems so 'new' on Food Network specials covering pastry competitions is actually very old, and much more widely popular than it is today. So, it was much easier for a patisserie specialist to come to the attention of the very food conscious politician Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord. Talleyrand is probably the third most important non-Royal politician in French history, following only Napoleon and Cardinal Richileau. As important as dining was to Talleyrand's political techniques, it is curious to read that culinary matters were of practically no importance to Talleyrand's boss, Napoleon.Talleyrand was Careme's first very important patron, the second being the very wealthy Rothchild family. Having such powerful patrons at an early stage in his career did not prevent Careme from suffering and ultimately dying from the occupational disease of cooks, especially cooks in great houses. That is, disorders of the lungs from breathing in smoke and carbon monoxide from charcoal fires in dark, poorly ventilated basement kitchens. The great irony here is that the architectural convention of placing large kitchens in the basement came from the great residential architect Palladio, a major hero in Careme's interest in architecture as an inspiration to his centerpiece constructions in sugar and pastry.One of Careme's most famous influences on gastronomy was the classification of mother sauces, but his subtle influence is much greater. Another little surprise in the telling of the times was the fact that the style of food service common in great French meals was quite unlike what we are used to today. The French style almost seemed like a 'family style' service where many dishes were placed on the table at once. The modern system plating moderately sized courses, delivered to the table one at a time was imported from Russia and was gaining in popularity in Paris after 1815. Careme was a great advocate of this method of service.Just a note here to suggest that you do not buy this book with the thought that you will actually make many of the recipes in this book. A fair number can be done, but many involve ingredients that are simply no longer available and many preparation techniques will try the patience of even the most devout foodie. They remind me again and again that much of older French cuisine is built on the premise of its clients having poor teeth. It abounds in purees, aspics, and mousses squeezing some of the most improbable things through coarse screens for hours.But, this is all part of the picture the author very successfully paints of haute cuisine in the time of Napoleon, even if the Emperor was not himself a gourmand.Highly recommended reading for anyone with an interest in culinary history."},{"Title":"Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin Careme, the First Celebrity Chef","review":"The review before me explains well the contents of this book. I would only add that you learn how Careme pulled together the skills of speciality cooks to create grand meals and, in turn, earned the title of chef. Sadly, the very process or cooking (carbon monoxide and partilate matter in the lungs from charcoal-fuled stoves and ovens) killed him while only in his 40s but he was dedicated to writing about his skills as much as he used them, thus codifying what we know as Haute' cuisine and creating the first modern cookbooks.Fortunately Kelly's writing style does not bog down in detail and he is quite readable. The parallel social history of the upper classes is enjoyable reading as well."},{"Title":"Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin Careme, the First Celebrity Chef","review":"Careme was THE celebrity chef.

It gives a great glimpse of life below stairs, but there is still a scent of lost glamour and luxury. Fun read, uncomplicated"},{"Title":"Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin Careme, the First Celebrity Chef","review":"For an excellent blend of biography and cookbook, choose Cooking For Kings: The Life Of Antonin Careme, The First Celebrity Chef, a survey of the life of the first known celebrity chef Antonin Careme and his recipes. The cook's own memoirs are used to trace his rise from an abandoned child to becoming one of the greatest cooks in Paris. Careme was more than a chef: he invited chef's tools, he cooked for kings and noblemen, and he even made Napoleon's wedding cake. His marriage of food with glamour made him a notable figure - as well as the first chef to become rich by publishing cookbooks. This is a lively history recommended for food fans."},{"Title":"Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin Careme, the First Celebrity Chef","review":"What an extraordinary read!

I'm interested in the Napoleonic era (so of course swooned over the descriptions of pink butter sauce and light green sauce for the eels at Napoleon's brother's wedding - reflecting the Neoclassical colours that Josephine favored - and the rest), and am also intersted in Regency England - so the description and pictures of the feast for the Prince Regent at Brighton Pavillion alone were well worth the price of the book for me (everything else, which is excellent, is icing on the cake) - the cover photo is a partial view of the kitchens at Brighton Pavillion, inside is the full 2-page illustration (there is also a double-page colour illustration of the banqueting rooms at the Royal Pavillion at Brighton, as well as Cruikshank's \\"High Life Below Stairs\\" drawing, not to mention many others of high interest).

WAY TOO MUCH VOCAB IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRST TEN LESSONS. by this, i mean that if u want 2 learn how to count, say colors,illnesses, and common everyday foods, u must look at the glossary.most aren't included in the dialogues. hindi #'s are very,very irregular compared 2 english and trying to look it up in the glossary and memorize like that makes things harder. (i can only count up 2 twenty so far and i'm on the 9th lesson!). the same goes for the other things i mentioned.and 2 add a little more, the author likes to explain things clearly. but explain things clearly by using linguistic or language jargon. i had to find out on my own wat transitive and intransitive verbs were on own 4 example.but other than these, everything seems fine to me. but i havent tried the writing lessons. and do get the cd's. but if u can't u'll survive with the cassettes(although that'll be a little harder with those)BUT BEWARE!

For those starting from scratch, this book is the best option.Snell and Weightman move way too fast and you quickly find yourself in way over your head (unless you already have a background in hindi). I found this Bhatia's romanization excellent because it emphasized the difference between english and hindi sounds, and most importantly, Bhatia was consistent throughout (though hopefully some of the typos towards the end will be fixed in a future edition). His pronounciation introduction is also the best I've seen as far as emphasizing and drilling Hindi vocal nuances. The pacing of the book is very comfortable for the complete beginner.Bhatia also does not take anything for granted. A lot of important questions left unanswered by other books are treated thoroughly in this text (like the compound use of &quot;lena&quot;, &quot;jaana&quot;, and &quot;dena&quot;; the frequent ommision of the &quot;a&quot; sound in the middle of words; and the fact that words like &quot;mahal&quot; and &quot;kahana&quot; are pronounced &quot;mehel&quot; and &quot;kehena&quot;; just to name a few...) You are really able to digest everything as you go along. Bhatia's word list and grammatical summary in the back are god-sends, and his mnemonics like &quot;nerd nouns&quot; and &quot;laal adjectives&quot; are clever and effective. He also puts his lessons in a cultural perspective that is crucial for using your hindi socially.One criticism I would make is the lack of emphasis on the devanagri script. If you use this book, you should really take the initiative and learn the script. It will help you as you progress to more advanced books.It seems like the few who gave this book a bad wrap are educators who are used to hindi being taught in a certain way. I think the things that make this book different also make it the best.My recommendation is start out with this book, then go through Snell and Weightman, using the early lessons as review, then go through Surendra Gambhir's pricey but excellent &quot;Spoken Hindi&quot; set. All these books have their lessons on cassette. I transferred all the lessons to CD, which made my studying much more efficient. Also get McGregor's beautiful Hindi-English Dictionary which will be a cozy campanion throughout. If you can even find the Misra and Fairbanks book, don't bother. It is quite antiquated and impractical, and the tapes are a nightmare.

I would have also preferred more attention on how to write the characters.I'd still recommend this book, but a little more visual assistance (the book is a bit dry, as it is predominantly textual) would have enhanced my learning speed, as well as more romanization of hindi words, especially for beginners such as myself."},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi, 2e: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"This book is clear and comprehensive, yet simple enough for a complete beginner.

I got this book from a friend after the loss of our first son Luke. The big thing that bothered me the most were the devotional titles like \\"what do you say I am\\"? well that one never really answered the question and it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when an author begins a chapter with a question and it's never really answered.In fact I feel like it kept me back from healing and kept me in a very sad dark place for a long time. Now this book doesn't take full credit for that but it was a big part of the reason why that was.It didn't really encourage me and it's the last book I'd give to someone because to put it simply it wasn't very well written. I am thankful this book is hard to find.I do recommend the one year book of Hope, the writer lost two of her children to a genetic disorder before they were 7 months old. Its not only helpful to parents who've lost a child but really to anyone who's going through a trying time the loss of a close family member, a child, a cancer battle.

This book became even more of a lifeline to me when we went on to miscarry Hannah later that same year. The author, having miscarried three babies and lost one son in infancy, was so honest and \\"real\\" both in sharing pain and hope."},{"Title":"Grieving the Child I Never Knew","review":"This is the perfect book for those of us who have faced the sudden and unexpected end of a pregnancy. I didn't know how to grieve my loss, after all, I had never seen or held or touched or heard my baby, but all the same, I felt an unexplainable depth of pain and loss. This book helped me to validate my unborn child's existence, give him or her an identity, and work through the process of healing. Five months after my loss, I still hurt and grieve and ache for my baby, but I know I'm on the road to recovery and will continue to recover with the help of books like this one. I also ordered one for my mother, who suffered a miscarriage 33 years ago...she said it even helped her to deal with the loss of that \\"unknown\\" child so long ago. I would recommend this to anyone who has suffered a pregnancy loss, who has lost a young child, or who loves someone who is going through such a difficult time as that."},{"Title":"Grieving the Child I Never Knew","review":"I would definitely recommend this product to any person who lost a baby - before of after the birth. It would be a very thoughtful gift to give a grieving mother as soon as possible, or even years after the fact."},{"Title":"Grieving the Child I Never Knew","review":"I read/journaled in this book after my second miscarriage. It helped me with things that I did not even know I needed help with. I liked the guided questions and found them to be very helpful.

Overall great book and made me feel more normal with the reactions I have had."},{"Title":"Grieving the Child I Never Knew","review":"I suffered a late miscarriage four years ago, and this book still brings back memories of comfort to me. My husband bought it just days after our loss. I was deep in grief and at a point of depression, so it was good for me to read the words in this book and have a place to journal my feelings. To this day, my book is a treasure to remember the child I never knew by."},{"Title":"COMMAND AND CONTROL ON THE WESTERN FRONT: The British Army's Experience 1914-18","review":"The British Army and especially its officer corp during World War I has been characterized in book and film as being obstinate and even stupid, unwilling to learn and incapable of understanding the new dynamics of the battlefield.To cope with the static trench warfare, the British had developed tanks, while the Germans had developed their 'stormtrooper' tactics.While it is certainly true that the dynamics of the battlefield had changed, in truth so had the British generals. By early 1917 the BEF had developed a new tactical system based on fire and movement much like that of the stormtroopers, and which was to continue to be the basis for infantry assaults until today.This book brings together a series of articles by a range of writers to analyze what the British did during the war. It shines a whole new light on British leadership."},{"Title":"Frommer's California 2005 (Frommer's Complete Guides)","review":"This is a massive 700 page guide suitable to the large State of California, a state that has many places to explore and visit.It has a comprehensive description of almost every area of California and has excellent maps and guides including street maps of San Francisco. You will not be disappointed with this book as a guide. You will be disappointed with a lack of photographs. A picture is worth a 1000 words and this book has virtually none.

Perhaps I expected too much, but I find the Frommer's California to be worthless.For example, to say that this guide covers \\"san francisco's hippest resturants\\" is a bit of a stretch. They list about 10 old standards, in a town with about 4000 resturants - a good start, but nothing particularly hip. The guide focused on north beach and fisherman's wharf. San Francisco's bar and music scene is huge - about 6 places are listed, none particularly cutting edge.The strength of the guidebook is probably out of town - Yosemite, Gold Country, Eureka. Even there, I found the information didn't really have the bite it should. Focus was on toursity stuff, not the really fun stuff.This guidebook needs a top-to-bottom revamp, instead of a yearly update to make sure the phone numbers are correct.For san francisco especially, get smaller more focused guidebooks."},{"Title":"Frommer's California 2005 (Frommer's Complete Guides)","review":"This book covers the entire state in one easy-to-carry book. Whether you're looking for romantic bed and breakfasts in the Wine Country, the hippest restaurant in San Francisco, or the best beaches in LA and San Diego, this book is all you'll need. It covers hotels ranging from a beach front motel in Santa Monica to the best places to stay in Yosemite's camp grounds."},{"Title":"Frommer's California 2005 (Frommer's Complete Guides)","review":"My wife and I bought this book in preparation for a week-long trip down the California coast in August 2006. We started with a couple of days in Napa and Sonoma and visited a number of wineries, including several recommended by Frommer's. The recommended ones (including Schramsberg, Artesa and Chateau St. Jean) were all highlights of our visit, and we found ourselves wishing that we had gone to some of Frommer's other starred wineries instead of less impressive ones that had been recommended by friends, magazines, etc. Frommer's restaurant listings were also dead-on: the recommended ones were all fantastic, while we agreed with the \\"overrated\\" assessment of another.From then on, having realized that we could trust the book's advice, we found ourselves relying on Frommer's more and more when choosing restaurants and other attractions. From a small Chinese restaurant in Carmel to an outstanding barbecue place in San Luis Obispo, we never had a bad meal while following the book's suggestions. We also felt that the section on Big Sur, though a bit brief, steered us to the most spectacular sights and hikes and helped us make the most of our drive down that wonderful stretch of coastline. The hotels we stayed at in San Simeon and L.A., again at the book's recommendation, were just what we were looking for. Finally, at the end of our trip in L.A., Frommer's guided us to the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, a fascinating and worthwhile attraction that we would not have known about otherwise.Because this was the only book we brought on our trip, I have no basis for comparison with other California guidebooks. I am sure there are other books that are equally accurate, but as someone who travels a lot and has used many different guidebooks--both good and bad--I was genuinely impressed with the amount of accurate and helpful information that Frommer's managed to cram into this book. From fine dining to cheap take-out, luxury hotels to motels and B&Bs;, and big-name attractions to off-the-beaten-path finds, this book guided us through a well-rounded California vacation while helping us avoid tourist traps. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frommer's California 2005 (Frommer's Complete Guides)","review":"This is the kind of book which asks to be read for hours and hours AND then you go on double check on the internet.

Clint leaves, thinking back over the past year in which he chases the assailant who raped and murdered his wife Emily. Although he wants to die, Clint needs to kill his spouse's murderer. Meanwhile Mattie thinks back ten years ago to her husband, the sheriff, who was killed and she wants nothing to happen to their child.The next day, a gunslinger shoots Clint in the back.

The first contrast to a typical Western is that this book is female centered, not male centered. Gloss has used journals and diaries of women in the West in hopes to draw out some of the nontraditional women's roles in the West, &quot;I hope their strong, honest voices can be heard in this book.&quot; Showing that gender roles weren't fixed as many chose to believe, we see Lydia doing hard, manual labor, and Tim cooking and doing the wash. Lydia, the heroine of the book, abandons typical women's roles in the very beginning when she picks up and moves West alone to start a new life. &quot;I'd rather have my own house, sorry as it is, than the wedding ring of a man who couldn't be roused from sleeping when his own child was slipping out of me unborn.&quot; This isn't what we would expect to read had this book been written in the 50's when gender roles were fixed. What we see is the 80's ideology that a woman can make it without a man by her side, &quot;She changed off, sawing through a butt and then splitting it, piling up the shingles on a tarp and dragging the hillock behind her back to the house before she bucked the next one.&quot; Gloss attempts to break down the Western stereotypes for men. Tim and Blue are like real men we could meet if we were on the frontier, not larger than life heros that commonly dominate Western myths. Unlike heroes admired for their independence, Tim and Blue are dependant on others and each other on the frontier . They become almost like children in their dependance on others, &quot;He turned and looked at her, ducking his chin.&quot; Things don't come easily for them and they struggle like any human being would have, &quot;Tim put the gun down in the mud and went, shaking, across the bloody wallow on his knees.&quot; Even being a cowboy is rejected in this book, &quot;He said he'd seen years when a good cowboy couldn't by himself a job, but a good cook could pretty much always find work.&quot; The central narrator is constantly shifting in this book. While this is unexpected for a Western, I enjoy the build up of different stories and thoughts that can emerge from this style of writing. Besides narrations from characters, Gloss utilizes Lydia's journal entries written in her actual voice making the story more real, personal, and familiar. This helps us recognize and remember Lydia's real identity, while the central narration builds the events of her daily life in a flowing form. Dreams of easy success are shot down in The Jump Off Creek. Giving a truer picture of the West, The Jump Off Creek is not a romanticized myth of adventure and easy success. Gloss establishes a view that shows the desperation of lives in a West where there is nothing new and glorious to see and experience every day. We see the miserable and wretched hard lives that one might have encountered. Fantasies of ease and comfort in the West are gone in this novel. It isn't a fairy tale like the traditional Western, where the good guy always wins, and the hero can handle any problem successfully. This book doesn't contain a lot of action, but instead it brings out the monotonous daily life of establishing a new home in the West and centers on the domestic side of the West. Gloss tells us of the every day grind and challenges of lives where sometimes people fail and hours of hard work are only the beginning of more hours of hard work."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"Mrs. Lydia Sanderson had married and her husband had moved into her room at her father's house so that she could continue to run her father's farm and help nurse her sick father. After both her father and her husband die, she sells all her husband's possessions and buys a relinquishment claim in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, leaving her binding life behind: &quot;The truth is. . . I'd rather have my own house, sorry as it is, than the wedding ring of a dead man who couldn't be roused from sleeping when his own child was slipping out of me unborn&quot; (81).This novel is the story of about the first year and a half of her homestead. She is an incredibly laconic person and the converstations seem to drag on because more is understood or thought than is spoken. She is an incredibly positive woman who faces homesteadings challenges without self-doubt or equivocating whether it is evicting the squatters from her home, chasing a bear that is stalking her goats, or spitting cedar shakes for a new roof. However, she always tries to be proper. A neighbor rides up when she is nailing poles into the chinks of her log cabin, and she comments, &quot;I smiled an presented myself as ladylike as liable to be with a hammer in my hand and nails in my teeth!&quot; (102). Lydia Sanderson's character is awe-inspiringly solid and by the end, she is willing to teach the male hero how to put up hay.Unfortunately, the more traditional male physical conflict story of two ranchers, Blue Odell and Tim Whiteaker take over the narrative. Wolfers begin to shoot cattle to provide meat for their poisoned bait, and they set leg-hold traps that wound a bear so that it begins to prey on domesticated animals. Blue and Tim avenge their losses, but the &quot;evil wolfers&quot; always retaliate with stronger measures. The conflict escalates from words, to loosing a picketed horse, to a fist fight, to a horse getting shot, and finally culminating in a rifle shoot-out.The two plots are entwined because Mrs. Sanderson and Mr. Odell and Mr. Whiteaker are neighbors who help each other in times of need. The men's unthinking impulse to retaliate for injustices is in sharp contrast to Mrs. Sanderson's well-considered, steady progress in building herself a home and good neighbors.It is unfortunate that a woman homesteading alone in order to establish her own freedom wasn't enough."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"Molly Gloss has written an incredible tale of a pioneer woman who settles in the wilds of the Oregon frontier. To classify this book as a 'western' is to diminish not only the story but the excellent prose that Ms Gloss has given to the reader. Lydia Sanderson,the heroine of this story, is an example of the thousands of women who settled the western United States,surmounting extreme conditions, with or without a man. This story is told from the thoughts and perspectives of human beings in a time when words were important and not just 'bantied about' without thought.The book gives one, in this high tech day and age, a sense of the real and important, in daily living. It puts ones feet back on the ground and gives a new perspective to our lives. Thank you Molly Gloss for this heroic woman and the encouragement she is to women today."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"Book came on time and as ordered.

Far from the aggrandized works of Louis Lamour or Zane Grey, Gloss paints a picture of life on the margins--with all its attendant difficulty and, most importantly, plain old hard work.

Molly Gloss is a wonderful writer. The images are evocative, the characters ring true, the plot is interesting and engrossing. My only criticism is the frequency with which she describes &quot;smiles&quot; (slow, deliberate, flat, purposefully, gently, etc.) -- it got a bit distracting. But that's a small criticism. Molly Gloss: write more, faster!"},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"This book was really good. It is based in Eastern Oregon, and being from Oregon myself, I can really relate to the landmarks stated in the book. It's about a woman who moves west to settle for good and hopefully raise a family and she meets many people who end up being her good friends eventually. There is no plot or moral but it is a good book if you want to find out a little about what it was like to try to settle out west, starting from nothing."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"The American frontier signifies one of the most commonly stereotyped places. Readers of all ages have a sense of frontier freedom. We picture in our heads rolling plains of green grass and western cowboys atop their black or brown stallion. However, in Molly Gloss's novel The Jump-Off Creek, she uses a different approach by writing in a feminist view. She focuses on the hardships and joys of the West by using a female as a main character. Her feminist approach in the story accounts for the considerable contrast with other western texts. In The Jump-Off Creek, we are introduced to Lydia, a female settler who is a widower, living alone on the western frontier. She is a very independent, stubborn, young lady, not accepting much help from anyone-especially Tim (an obvious admirer of hers). Female readers will relate easily with this character as she tries to defy all odds and make a life for herself on the frontier. Readers will also find that Molly molds many other people besides Lydia into this text. While creating these various characters, Molly Gloss chooses to use many different points of views. Her use of limiting omniscient narrators, gives the reader inside perspective, making the characters and the entire story more interesting. Many of these characters acquire slightly different traits then we would expect. Unlike earlier written western texts where gender traits were fixed, in The Jump-Off Creek readers may be surprised at a cowboy who loves to cook. Gender characteristics definitely defy previous gender stereotypes in this text. However, all of these characters appear to be secure in who they are. This cowboy is not ashamed of his hobby. Because of this, we see little, if any, character transformation. Unlike other westerns where we see the bad guys turn into the good guys to fulfill the complete stereotypical picture, Molly just creates another character to fulfill the description instead. We especially see the use of many personalities at the small gatherings that the characters take part in throughout this novel. However, one drawback about using numerous characters is that it is very difficult to give the reader complete closure. Mysteries lurk behind each character, and sometimes the reader is left with a sense of longing at the end. Will readers beable to determine what happens to each and every person in The Jump-Off Creek? Only those who reach the last page of the novel will beable to answer this! Because Gloss uses such a different approach then most westerns, this book raises the debate of fiction versus reality. After reading The Jump-Off Creek what we thought we knew before becomes a completely different place. That picture in our heads turns from grassy plains to snowy, frozen hillsides. Cowboys' hobbies include domestic activities and socializing with others, instead of drinking whiskey while hunting down Indians. And women have made the transition from useless to useful. The frontier is no longer only a man's territory. This novel The Jump-Off Creek is definitely a page turner that presents a totally different picture of the west. This book opens up discussion on views of how the west really was!"},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"The book Jump Off Creek by Molly Gloss was, in my opinion, very good reading. The author did a very good job combining a lovely writing style to a story that I felt needed to be told. Most western novels focus on the men who settled the west and the things they endured. They tend to portray women of the west as weak and dependent on the cowboy. This story gives the women of the west a whole new image. One that I'm sure was important to western settlement. It is the story of a pioneer woman's journey to the west, the difficulties she faced along the way, the people she grew to know and the struggle to survive in this pioneer country. The writing style the author uses throughout this book combines a third person narrative with numerous first person \\"journal\\" entries from the main character Lydia. This gives the book a sense of realism. It made me feel as though the story I read was taken from the journal of a real pioneer woman. It gave me the feeling that this story actually happened and that the author was transforming Lydia's tale into easier reading. The journal entries contain very rough abbreviations and a writing style that was typical of the pioneer. For example, in the opening journal entry, \\"Bought the black hinny Mule today, $18, also the spavint gray as my money is so short and I have hope he will put on wt, his eyes are clear w a smart look in them and his feet not tender.\\". Most pioneer men and women were not educated to the extent that we are today and the author did a good job of reflecting that in the entries. This also contributes to the realism that is portrayed by the author in this novel. It is obvious to me that the author did a very intricate study of the actual journals of pioneer women and a fine job of writing the journal entries for Lydia. The journal entries also gave me insight into the thoughts of Lydia. They brought me closer to Lydia and helped me sympathize with her. I could begin to sense her loneliness as the novel progressed and I could feel her pain as the tragedies unfolded. The third person narrative the author combines with these journal entries is very easy to read. It tells a wonderful story that is written well. Her descriptions of the places that are encountered in the novel are done in detail which made it easier for me, as the reader, to be there looking from the perspective of the third person. The dialog interested me in this novel because it was different than what I had read before. The characters of Lydia, Tim, and Blue all spoke in a straight forward manner. They read the expressions of the other characters well and they generally only said anything when they had something to say. There were a few instances where there was small talk exchanged but even it was short and to the point. There were many occasions in the novel when Tim and Blue, who were very close friends, did not even have to exchange talk because they already knew what the other was thinking. I'm sure this was typical of the western frontier. The frontier was a cruel place and the struggle to survive had a lot to do with people keeping to themselves. They did not have the time to sit around and gossip like we do today. There was always work to be done in order to survive in this cruel west. The story follows Lydia as she moves to the west to start a new life. Her husband had died and she had sold all of his stuff just to make enough money to finance her journey to the Jump Off Creek where she had bought a small shack and a piece of land. She met Tim on her journey to the Jump Off Creek and he had helped her find her way. She became friends with them and they helped each other out whenever they could. I don't want to give the story away so let me just say that the story follows the three of them through the struggles they faced on the frontier, not only with nature but also with other people and wild animals. The ending of the story lacks closure but I think this was intentional on the part of the author. It is not your typical western where the guy saves the girl from the evil of the west and they fall in love and live happily ever after. It tells a different story. It's a story that is more realistic and it introduces us to a new west. A west where women could make it on their own. A west where the struggle to survive does not simply fall on the shoulders of the typical cowboy. The novel ends leaving the reader wondering what happens next and, in my case, left me finishing the story in my own mind. I think this is a good way to end a story like this because each reader is different and this allows the reader the opportunity to finish the story themselves. It encourages thought among the reader and it brings plenty of controversy to a literatary discussion. Of the novels I have read this semester for my Western Literature course, this one is the best in my opinion, not just because I liked the writing style and the story itself, but also because it tells a story that I think is important for American society. The west was not just settled by the \\"Cowboy\\", and not all of the women of the west were brought out there by men with expansion and gold on their minds. Some women came to the west in search of their own dream. Some moved west to start a new life of their own. They were very courageous, independent, tough women. The west portrayed in the movies that we see is, in my opinion, not the west that actually existed. We as Americans have formed ideas about the west that we have seen portrayed in movies over and over. The west was not just about the cowboy and the helpless woman whom he saved because she was helpless and he was falling in love with her. It was about all of the people who went out there. Men, women, children, and people of other ethnic groups and many different religions. Many of these people gave their lives in order for American expansion to run its course. This novel is a wonderful tale of one woman who had the courage to face the west head on and the strength to overcome its dangers."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"I ran into this book 4 years ago and have since given probably 20 copies to my friends.

The character is compelling because her mission is, and those around her each have fully-developed personae and thus are fascinating to watch, but at the point where this story is ready to take off, it goes nowhere. Lydia, our strong female lead, rejects male attachment, but the author's point seems to be her soldiering on without needing something to fill that void. However, the other void, that of change or rise in her life, is not addressed, and the book ends up tapering out to a conclusion that reminds me of the null poetry of innumerable urban wordsmith slams I've attended. The point is the no point. But do we need another voice telling us that, when we already have death to stare us down at the end of a full life? I would read more from this author, and appreciated the strengths of this book, but find it drifting in the entropic grey area of all things that fence-sit."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"A wonderful past pace for western lit.

In many ways, the novel is not your typical Western. The book begins with Lydia, a brave, independent woman from the East, homesteading by herself in the 1890's. After her husband died, she &quot;sold his clothes and his dog and horse and everything else that belonged to him, to have the money to come West.&quot; The story, though told in multi-vocal text, is largely made up of Lydia's daily journal entries and accounts of the struggles she faces as a woman alone in the West. I found it interesting to get a woman's perspective of the West for a change. Though there are some similarities, the novel differs in many ways from the common western myth. Although gender is still established in the novel, Gloss also violates gender roles. The male characters are often portrayed as child-like instead of the heroes we are used to reading about in western novels. The reader learns early on, for example, that Tim Whiteaker, Lydia's friend and neighbor, is a cook. Tim claimed to have &quot;spent as many summers cooking as he ever did cowboying.&quot; Just as Tim violated gender roles by cooking, so too did Lydia by pioneering alone. Evelyn, Lydia's only female friend on the frontier, commented once, &quot;I admire you so much Lydia! You are brave as anyone!&quot; In a sense, Lydia takes the place of the male hero in the story. She has some of the qualities men usually bear in the common western myth like bravery and independence. &quot;I have been long getting my independence and am much afraid of losing it through some need or circumstance,&quot; she says. Lydia realizes the limitations, however, that she has as a woman in the West such as her lack of physical strength. Besides gender, another difference between the commonly portrayed West and the West found in The Jump-Off Creek is the lack of action and adventure. Most Westerns are packed with gun slinging and bar fights. Gloss, however, focuses more on the hardships of daily life and the constant struggle for survival. During this time on the Western frontier, times were hard, decent jobs were hard to come by, and death was all around. Animals were killed daily by poisoned bait and the harsh weather of winter. Men, too, were inclined to violence and had to be cautious of making enemies. Those brave and strong enough to fight the elements of nature also had to accept failure. Near the end of the story, following a treacherous ice storm, Gloss describes Lydia. &quot;Crossing the field with the empty kettle, she fell on the ice and sat there crying, dryly, tiredly.' But like all of the other survivors, she had to get up and move on. Despite the differences with the common Western myth, The Jump-Off Creek does share some similarities. For example, Gloss frequently writes about loneliness in the West. In many of the Western novels, loneliness is a common problem faced by settlers. Lydia, however, denies feeling lonely throughout the entire novel. From the very beginning Lydia claims, &quot;I am used to being Alone, in spirit if not in body, and shall not be Lonely, as I have never been inclined that way. I believe what I feel is just a keenness to get to that place and stand under my own roof at last.&quot; Evelyn, however, who is surrounded by family, claims to be &quot;beside herself with loneliness&quot; and is thankful for her new companion, Lydia. Besides loneliness, the characters in The Jump-Off Creek possess another similarity with the settlers found in typical Western novels. When it comes right down to it, they too desired transformation and the fulfillment of the American dream. Lydia confesses to Blue that &quot;I had it in my mind to come West and take up ranching. I suppose that I was seeking the boundless possibilities that are said to live on the frontier.&quot; The only difference is usually it is the male in search of those dreams, not the independent female. Overall, I enjoyed reading Gloss's book. After the characters were fully introduced the story flowed much better and became more interesting. I would definitely recommend The Jump-Off Creek to the reader who is interested in the story of the &quot;real West&quot;. Though gender is not always defined and the struggles of daily life are more prevalent than action, the novel shares some common themes -loneliness and transformation- with the typical Western."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"A woman homesteads by herself in eastern Oregon. There are the standard dangers, problems, terrors and tragedies. This is saved from being trite by the stoic and undaunted character of the woman. Gloss also avoids the usual romantic happily-ever-after with the man next door.Gloss has used journals and diaries of women in the West in hopes to draw out some of the nontraditional women's roles in the West, \\"I hope their strong, honest voices can be heard in this book.\\" Showing that gender roles weren't fixed as many choose to believe, we see Lydia doing hard, manual labor, and Tim cooking and doing the wash. Lydia, the heroine of the book, abandons typical women's roles in the very beginning when she picks up and moves West alone to start a new life. \\"I'd rather have my own house, sorry as it is, than the wedding ring of a man who couldn't be roused from sleeping when his own child was slipping out of me unborn.\\"Gloss attempts to break down the Western stereotypes for men. Tim and Blue are like real men we could meet if we were on the frontier, not larger than life heroes that commonly dominate Western myths. Unlike heroes admired for their independence, Tim and Blue are dependant on others and each other on the frontier . They become almost like children in their dependence on others, \\"He turned and looked at her, ducking his chin.\\" Things don't come easily for them and they struggle like any human being would have, \\"Tim put the gun down in the mud and went, shaking, across the bloody wallow on his knees.\\" Even being a cowboy is rejected in this book, \\"He said he'd seen years when a good cowboy couldn't by himself a job, but a good cook could pretty much always find work.\\"Besides narrations from characters, Gloss utilizes Lydia's journal entries to make the story more real, personal, and familiar. This helps us recognize and remember Lydia's real identity, while the central narration builds the events of her daily life in a flowing form. Dreams of easy success are shot down in The Jump Off Creek. Giving a truer picture of the West, The Jump Off Creek is not a romanticized myth of adventure and easy success. Gloss establishes a view that shows the desperation of lives in a West where there is nothing new and glorious to see and experience every day. We see the miserable and wretched hard lives that one might have encountered. Fantasies of ease and comfort in the West are gone in this novel. It isn't a fairy tale like the traditional Western, where the good guy always wins, and the hero can handle any problem successfully. This book doesn't contain a lot of action, but instead it brings out the monotonous daily life of establishing a new home in the West and centers on the domestic side of the West. Gloss tells us of the every day grind and challenges of lives where sometimes people fail and hours of hard work are only the beginning of more hours of hard work."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"The Jump Off Creek: A Book Review The nineteen nineties feminist movement has been slowly permeating every domain of society. Female empowerment has become an increasingly common protagonist theme among all genres of literature as well. The American western novel has become subjugated to a new hero. In Molly Gloss's novel The Jump Off Creek the feminist literature movement finds a graceful home.Jump Off Creek tells the story of Lydia Sanderson, a widow taking up a claim in the Blue Mountains of Oregon. The text begins with a spring journal entry. This is the beginning of Ms. Sanderson's endeavor. The journal entries are continued throughout the story, not only to keep the reader aware of the time line of the story, but also to provide a unique first person account of Lydia's life story. Lydia says of herself, &quot;I am used to being Alone, in spirit if not in body, and shall not be Lonely, as I never have been inclined that way. I believe what I feel is just a keenness to get to that place and stand under my own roof at last.&quot; Lydia's strong and independent character is a careful mix of gracefulness and ruggedness. Her resourcefulness and amazing endurance makes the Ingalls family look pass&eacute;.Yet the feminist tones of this book manage to make concessions and include some strong male characters to compliment Lydia. On her way to the homestead Lydia meets Tim Whiteaker. Tim is a John Wayne figure minus the capacity for conversation. Early in the text the model for Tim's behavior is clearly etched. One passage describes him as such: &quot; He stood at the edge of the creek, not looking toward (Lydia), while he pushed his hair back up under his hat with the heel of one dirty hand. Then he gave the dog a word, took hold of the bay's reigns and started off afoot...&quot; Gloss managed to soften this granite figure by making him an excellent cook. Tim even ends up taking up cooking at a nearby ranches when funds are running out. But while his bread baking and cattle branding may be time consuming, Mr. Whiteaker still manages to take time out to pay special visits to Ms Sanderson. It is through these visits that a fragile and special friendship blossoms just as Lydia's wildflowers.Tim also serves as an avenue for another friendship to develop for Lydia. This being with Blue Odell. Blue triumphantly beats the so-called Indian side-kick role in this novel. He develops more three dimensionally than Tim. This is in part due to the relationship he has with Lydia. While these two characters have more dialogue, it is their physical interaction that speaks the true message.Of course the standard Western elements are retained in this novel, even though the main characters have been assigned the opposite sex's code of conduct. Man still has to fight nature; the weather and a bear. The conflict of man vs. man is also important. In this case there is only one drunken fight, but the altercations between some unscrupulous wolf hunters and Lydia's male friends nourish the western need for violence.Another important characteristic of a Western novel is the main character's quest for identity. Molly Gloss obviously wrote in the previous characters to aide in this task. But it often takes a character of the same sex on the opposite end of the personality spectrum to clearly define that identity. The definition comes via the means of Evelyn Walker. She is a young, rotund, bubbly, mother of three. Gloss's careful attention to these two women allow Evelyn's brightly smiling face to enhance Lydia's stern beauty, not diminish it any.Lydia's character is also enhanced in the story through a series of social gatherings at the Walker's. The reader admires her quiet, near invertedness among the chatty and whimsical fourth of July celebration. This process of the reader identifying with Lydia is a slow process throughout the story. In fact, the nature of the text never moves the reader to feel very strongly about any of the characters, because indeed, Lydia never demonstrates any strong emotions. Perhaps the only persons the reader may ever develop active feelings towards are Lydia's late husband and her parents, who aren't even active in the story!The simple link that the reader develops with Lydia, and which Lydia in turn shares with the characters, is reflective of the style of prose in which this novel was written. The plain language is honest and appealing. The matter-of-fact narrative is believable. Simply put, the journey the reader embarks on with Ms Sanderson develops into a wonderful meditative exploration of self. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey and strongly suggest that other readers pack their bags for the trip."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"Molly Gloss' The Jump-Off Creek is a story about a woman's independence in Western society. It follows the lives of the three main characters; Lydia Sanderson, Tim Whiteaker, and Tim's Indian friend, Blue. Throughout the book, Gloss tells her story by using the different perspectives of her characters. These changes in points of view allow the reader to understand the main characters personalities and to watch them develop. Gloss uses the harshness of the West and its winters to strengthen her characters, and she tries to show her reader that life in the West was not as easy as it normally appears to be in typical western stories. The Jump-Off Creek demonstrates life through hardships and trials. But, through them all, the main characters are able to persevere and are made stronger. It is my opinion that her portrayal of the West was well done and will challenge the reader to think differently about how he or she conceives the West. Gloss' book is a western which shows the reader how a woman saw the West. No longer is the western only about cowboys and Indians. Now, the reader is allowed to see how a woman, and an independent one at that, perceived the West and the trials that she had to go through just in order to survive the first winter. Lydia Sanderson's husband had recently died and had left their farm land to her. With a restless soul and the need for transformation, Lydia is driven West to find a new life. However, Lydia does not go West to find a new husband. She does not need any help from a man, and is rather reluctant to accept any help from the opposite sex. She intends to make it on her own, and throughout the book, she does maintain her independence. She does not conform to the lifestyle of the other women in the West. Gloss uses to reflect women's position in today's society. Gloss intends to prove that a woman and survive without a man. And, what better way to prove this for the young women of today than through a story of the harsh West? Gloss keeps the theme of her abnormal depiction of the West in her portrayal of Tim Whiteaker. Mr. Whiteaker was not a typical cowboy. In fact, none of the men in this story are. The men in this book depend on each other a lot more than the men are allowed to in other westerns. Tim and Blue rely on each other so much that, in the end when Blue dies, Tim becomes so lonely that he begins to rely on Lydia's company. These men are also quite squeamish when it comes to blood and injuries. For example, after Blue is injured during a fight with a bear, Tim calls Lydia to stitch up Blue as he cannot stomach the thought of doing it himself. Tim even feels the need to step outside while she is working. Tim shows that he is not a typical cowboy in many other ways. He is a cook, and he even gets a job cooking at a ranch during part of the story. He never finishes a fight, at one time he falls off of his horse, and many times the reader sees that Tim has bad aim while shooting a gun. None of these are characteristics of a cowboy, and may make one wonder how he has been able to survive the harshness of the West. In her journal entries, Lydia constantly refers to Tim in childlike terms, as she often does while she speaks to him. Throughout The Jump-Off Creek, the weather plays a big part in the characters' lives. Especially during the winters, the reader is able to see how hard a settler had to work in able to get through an ice storm. A settler did not only have himself to worry about, but any animals that he might have, as they could not care for themselves during this weather. If the animals were to die, the settler would have a hard year to look forward to as his livelihood would be gone. The toughness of the land, and the weather that came with it, eventually drew the characters closer as they tried to band together in order to survive. I feel that Gloss's portrayal of the sexes in her book are quite beneficial to young women in today's society. So many times, in literature and other areas of life, women are called upon to take the &quot;back seat,&quot; or a supporting role. In The Jump Off Creek, Gloss shows that this secondary role is not necessary. She shows her female readers that they should feel free to take the reigns and strike out on their own adventures. No longer must a woman need a man. Also, Gloss shows her male readers that it is &quot;O.K.&quot; to ask for help. They need not &quot;do it alone&quot; as so many men feel they need to do in today's society. I enjoyed this book, and I believe that while it may challenge a person's traditional view of the West, it does so thoughtfully. Now, the reader is allowed to make their own decisions about &quot;how the West was won,&quot; and to consider the role of the female. Could the West have survived without the woman? Gloss does not think that it would have. And, she challenges her reader to think the same."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"An incredibly poignant novel that reads and feels as sharp and clear as a freezing cold running stream.The author writes crisply, economically and precisely to reflect the times and circumstances of the lifestyle of Lydia Sanderson. Lydia is widowed and decides to purchase what remains of a forsaken homestead in the Blue Mountains. The challenges that she must face up to are great, being a woman, even greater, still. The work she must do is brutal, the weather a force to break men's souls, the physical labor more demanding than anything she knows. Yet she accepts this completely.In brilliant detail the author portrays how this woman lived alone and prospered. It is a fascinating accounting of her lifestyle; the items she has in her possession, what she eats and how she transports herself and her animals. All of this is told conservatively as her journal recounts the challenges that unfold before her.In contrast to her personal life, the reader is introduced to the folk that live nearest to her. These are strong and beautiful characters, tough and tender, strong and bending. In very difficult times, they came together and helped each other. Their spirit is reflected through the accounting of Lydia's story."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"The novel Jump-Off Creek, written by author Molly Gloss, is a different kind of western set in Oregon. I really enjoyed this novel but I did not believe it should be classified as a western. Molly Gloss writes a novel in Jump-Off Creek that in many ways in not a western and breaks many norms of the average western. There are a couple reasons why this novel does not really fit the stereo-typical definition of a western at all. The first reason is that it is set in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, which is not the traditional setting for the average western. Most westerns have settings in California or down in Texas where there is nothing but wide open desert with little towns in between. The second reason, one that I enjoyed, is the strong woman in the lead role of this novel. This novel has a female center rather than a male center or theme. The idea of a strong woman presence in the typical western is not usually found. It was something I found interesting in the novel and again enjoyed. This woman, unlike many found in a typical western, is committed to her life of independence. Also, along with the strong woman as one of the lead characters, there was a Native American as the hero of the novel. It you look at most average westerns, either in books or films, you will not find many minority heroes running around. This was a different look at the average western and again one I would like to see more from today's writers. As far as characters go, I felt the author really did not spend to much time developing and making them interesting. I felt the characters in many ways were one-dimensional, and as a reader I did not have a lot of emotion for them or I just did not care about many of the character. The only character I felt any emotion for was the Native American character named Blue. The first reason I found him interesting was because he has a very different name that grabbed my attention toward his character over the others. This can be the key the author needed to get the reader into the novel and start caring. The second reason I found Blue to be interesting was the fact that he was one of the most caring characters in the story and I felt he had a heart. Blue showed emotion though out the novel and was easily the most interesting. He can be described as a rounded character because he is a person with many dimensions while many of the other character are only one-dimensional. In most westerns the fight scenes is one of the reason there is such a huge following and why they are so liked by many. The fight scene is there to show the masculinity of the western. For example, in Hondo the last fight scene is what the reader remembers best and judges the whole novel on. Without the last fight scene many novels are forgotten. The fight scenes are very weak in Jump-Off Creek, which again is not the style of the average western. Lack of action and the boring pace of everyday life furthers this novel from being a western. The masculinity of this novel is never shown through the fight scene and a more femininity is shown with a female as the center character. Something I did really like about this novel which again was a little different from many of the westerns I have seen was the journal throughout the story. About every twenty pages or more there is a short chapter that contains thoughts of the main character about anything. I enjoyed this aspect of the novel and felt it gave originality and creativity. It also stopped the boring pace of the novel and gave the reader something to think about. Overall, I feel this novel is not a western but more of a country tale set in Oregon. It feels more like a country novel because there are no big deserts or little one-stop towns. With the slow pace and weak fight scenes the novel does not set the feeling of a western. Also, with the presences of a strong woman and an Native American hero, many stereo type of westerns are being broken. Although, I really enjoyed the strong woman and Native American as character and overall liked this novel, I still feel this cannot be described as a western."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"Finally, a Western that does not sugar-coat frontier life or turn it into a non-stop/action-packed gun fight! This novel is a refreshing, well researched, trip back to the frontier days of the Pacific Northwest. Gloss presents us with characters that feel very real and very ordinary, but somehow adds a rare grace to their lives. The flow of her writing is delightful (as always) and I found myself very disappointed to reach the end of this novel--I didn't want to stop reading!I should add, though, that this is not a novel for those who require books to be jam-packed with action--you will not find much adrenalin in this story! On the other hand, if you are looking for a really good historical fiction read, this is a great book for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"I probably shouldn't be reading Molly Gloss. I'm a guy, after all. But maybe, at 64, some of the nastiness of being a guy has finally worn off. Because I love the way this woman writes. The Hearts of Horses hooked me, Wild Life wowed me, and now, this earlier absolute gem of a novel just blew me away. How does she do this thing where the essence of the story lies in what is not said? Lydia Sanderson, Tim Whiteaker, Blue Odell. None of them say very much of any real significance. All are stoic and uncomplaining of the \\"narrow circumstances\\" life has dealt them. In fact they are nearly inarticulate; yet all these feelings - of yearning and loneliness, of sorrow and regret, they are all somehow laid bare in the pauses. The descriptions, the gestures, the sidelong glances, the facial expressions - all become muted dialogue. Even the one character who seems unabashedly bad, the angry bigoted boy that is Harley Osgood, has an element of humanity in him that doesn't quite let you hate him. There are no simple black-and-white characters in Gloss's fiction. There are, instead, infinite shades of gray, and an attention to descriptive detail that makes you understand implicitly much of what is left unsaid. The years-long friendship between the two cowboys Whiteaker and Odell is perhaps one of the best portrayals of love between men that fiction has to offer. And I'm not talking about any \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" kinda stuff here either. These are just two men who have stuck together through thick and thin, mostly the latter, and a bond has formed that is stronger than most marriages. Enough said. This is simply a superb story. There oughta be a ten-star rating for books of this caliber. And by the way, what a wonderful film for thinking adults this could be. Thanks again, Molly. I'll be watching for the next book, so please, Write on! - Tim Bazzett, author of ReedCityBoy"},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"This story felt like I was living there...feeling, tasting, sweating, right along with the characters. I would have sworn Gloss was taking this word for word from the woman's diary. Being thrilled by such everyday struggles like getting a mule down the hill..now thats what I call virtual reality. I was so enthralled by the &quot;cowboys&quot;...kept thinking I never would have dreamed I'de love a book like this so much...but it was so true and delicious. Thanks for taking me to Oregon in the 1890's. It was a thrilling, amazing adventure. The struggle's the pioneers endured were incredible...so much more so for a woman, and a woman alone at that!"},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"The Jump-Off Creek The American West: a place of fun and excitement, action and adve nture. These stereotypes often come to mind when thinking about the West. However, do these terms ideally describe the real American West? In her novel, The Jump-Off Creek, Molly Gloss offers an opposing perspective of the Western frontier. Instead of focusing on the excitement of the West, she shows the struggles and hardships that may give a more realistic picture of the frontier. The Jump-Off Creek gives the reader a well-rounded portrayal of the West. Contrary to most Western novels, The Jump-Off Creek allows the reader to see the West through the eyes of a woman. Lydia Sanderson travels to the West alone where she makes her homestead. Lydia is not a glamorous woman but a woman of the land. Her life is not simple. It is a daily struggle for her to survive on her own. Unlike most Western novels the hero in the book is not a male. In fact, Lydia is definitely the heroine in The Jump-Off Creek. She represents the strength most women wish they could achieve but are afraid of being alone. Lydia ignores fears of being without a man and follows her dream of traveling West. Her courage is admirable and it is that which kept me turning the pages of the novel. The focus of The Jump-Off Creek is not on action or adventure and its scenes are not glamorous and beautiful. Instead it shows the often overlooked and sometimes ugly side of everyday life of the frontier and the strength it took just to survive. Although the traditional West is not always prevalent, in small passages throughout the text there are some glimpses of the West. A native American and his cowboy friend, Blue and Tim, are involved in two scenarios that are familiar to former Western novels. The two major characters are intertwined in both a bar fight and a struggle with a bear in the wilderness. However, the endings of the two scenes contrasts with the fights of typical Westerns. In both instances, the two &quot;heroes&quot; are defeated. After the quarrel behind the bar, Blue and Tim are left in pain. &quot;Tim lay where he was, drawn up protectively around his genitals. His ears rang. He breathed carefully through his mouth. After a long time he heard a Pianola playing through the wall of the building next to him, and after that Blue said, 'Sh*t,' on a high coughing gasp. Tim made a small sound too, meaning it to be a laugh, but it came out soft, a sigh.&quot; Blue and Tim are not invincible like typical Western heroes. They are mortal. Unlike the heroes of many Westerns they do not escape a brawl without a bruise or scratch. Blue and Tim show the realistic human qualities of pain and suffering. Throughout the novel Gloss thoughtfully includes journal entries written by Lydia to display the dialect of real women of the West. &quot;8 April Lost the way on poor directions but I am here now and glad for it, tho it is bad as I knew it would be, the stove rusted clear through, the roof rotted, the logs poor fitted and mildewed, the yard where the Animals must stand all Mud and stones.&quot; Through Lydia's journal we feel as if we are beside her in her adventures of surviving alone and we realize the harshness of her situation as she is making her own home on the frontier. While Lydia's views are most prominent throughout the text, Gloss uses smooth transitions to also write in the perspective of other characters. For example, Blue's viewpoint emerges in one chapter beginning with the following sentences: &quot;A woman rode out of the trees and stopped at the top of the hill to let down the fence rails. Blue saw her before Tim did.&quot; Although Gloss does not come right out and tell the reader that she is writing from Blue's perspective, it can quickly be inferred. While writing from the perspective of other characters one can get a feel for the distinct personalities of these characters. The use of many perspectives is a very beneficial literary device that Gloss thoughtfully uses to give the reader insight to each main identity. The conclusion of The Jump-Off Creek left me with a sense of disappointment. However, realistically, the ending contained a truth about the West that is often glamorized in most novels to leave the reader with a sense of false belief of the real frontier. Gloss reminds us that in the West not every story ended &quot;happily ever after.&quot; The question remains for the reader of The Jump-Off Creek: what is the real West? Is it the West of John Wayne in Hondo or is it the harsh life of Lydia Sanderson in The Jump-Off Creek? The answer is ambiguous: we cannot define it in simple terms. No doubt, both the excitement of Hondo and the reality of The Jump- Off Creek existed simultaneously. The Jump-Off Creek is a fast reading novel that offers a contrasting perspective of the frontier and leaves the reader with a more troubling, complex, and real picture of the American West."},{"Title":"Jump-Off Creek","review":"There is an old adage that two are better than one. But not according to Lydia Sanderson, a stiff and awkward pioneer woman of the 1890's, who left Pennsylvania after her husband died to make a stake in northeast Oregon country and the Blue Mountains. Fiercely independent and willing to face the hardships of living alone on a remote mountainside, this story by Molly Gloss is based on original journals of the time and painstakingly accurate in its details of the area.The theme--women can be independent and do it as well or better than men--is a popular one in these modern times, though its spin gives me pause. Was this really so strongly portrayed in those days? To the author's credit, however, she did at times give a hint of Lydia's loneliness. \\"I shall not see Evelyn Walker now nor any other woman until the Spring, and must harden my heart not to be Lonely.\\"Gloss's plain and homespun style of writing wove a pleasing tale. It made me want to unravel her story until the end. She has a rare ability to detail the mundane, while twining together different story lines in a unique way. Her realism made me believe she knew her setting well--albeit often painting it in shades of gray with words like dull and sooty. (I live in these mountains. When it came to her descriptions of the weather and the poverty of the times, she nailed it!)In the end, however, I was left unsatisfied, feeling a certain hopelessness and fatalism. I found myself wishing Lydia Sanderson would indeed find that soul mate, even pathetic Tim Whiteaker, her male suitor, who could at least make her life somewhat easier. Still, The Jump-Off Creek is a worthwhile read for its brilliant descriptions, accurate settings and life as it really was in this part of Oregon.

Byron Farwell has produced an excellent biography of a unique Victorian who led a life of incredible energy and movement. In fact, Burton seemed to find it impossible to stay in one place. Not always a likeable fellow, Burton lived for adventure. His dangerous journey into the Islamic holy city of Mecca , dressed as a Muslim and speaking fluent Arabic, vies with his discovery of Lake Tanganyika (with Speke) as the most famous of his exploits. But Farwell also describes many less well known adventures - Burton travelled to Salt Lake City in 1859 where he interviewed Brigham Young. He was British Consul in West Africa, Damascus, and Santos, Brazil. Burton usually completely ignored any duties he was given by his employer (Farwell says he was &quot;unemployable&quot;). Incredibly, much of his exploring was done while on dubious sick leave from the Indian Army. Farwell brings out Burton as an explorer of cultures and a scholar as well as a geographic explorer - Burton translated the Arabian Nights and other major oriental works. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Burton's early life, starting as an extremely naughty boy and maturing into an exceptional young swordsman who wrote a book on bayonet drill later adopted as the standard work by the British Army. Farwell is clearly fascinated, as well as sometimes exasperated by his subject."},{"Title":"Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton","review":"Burton by Byron Farwell is the fourth biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton that I have read -- I might have a little bit of an obsession. But, in my defense, since I want to BE him, it is necessary to do the research. Burton was a giant among the several 19th century explorers of Africa and the Middle East, a brilliant linguist and a prolific (if prolix) geographer and scientist.As emphasized by Farwell, Burton is most fascinating in his complexity, in the numerous conflicts that comprised his character. Burton longed to suffer the fevers and hardship associated with an overland caravan, but he could not tolerate (without copious complaints) the minor inconveniences of more civilized travel. Throughout his life, he remained loyal to Queen and Country, while at the same time confrontationally challenging the policies and patients of his supervisors in the Foreign Office. A student of all religions but practitioner of none, he married a woman for whom her God was everything. Burton vigorously sought fame and fortune through his actions and endeavors, but he could never come up with a consistent plan -- instead, he favored get-rich-quick schemes. Eventually, he was knighted and struck it big with his publication of A Thousand Nights and a Night, and then... he died.Of the Burton biographies that I have studied, Farwell's treatment has certain advantages for the amateur Burtonologist. The prose is well written, fast paced and insightful. The details are ably researched and the author comes off as an unbiased admirer without an agenda beyond trying to understand the Man. Other volumes on Burton, while more dense and scholarly, tend to be a bit more slanted."},{"Title":"Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton","review":"Farwell's biography of the extrordinary life of Capt. Sir Richard F. Burton is a fine work. Farwell's excellent style and knowledge of the 19th century are perfect backdrops to the the exploits of &quot;Ruffian Dick&quot;. The author manages to point out Burtons many talents and shortcomings in a fair, scholarly manner, without physco-babble or hero-worship. Yet more importantly, Burton's life is allowed to unfold as what it truly was, a grand adventure, full of exotic places, eccentric characters, brilliant victories and stinging defeats. Many biographies have been written concerning Burton, many are very good, but Farwell has managed to bring to life this truly larger then life personality"},{"Title":"Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton","review":"Having read \\"footsteps\\" and \\"the devil drives\\" one so esoteric the other an oversimplification, it was a plesant surprise to read about Capt Burton and not just his journeys as a detached observor. It is hard to believe that a man of such an intellectual force in so many areas is almost unknown to the common person.Farwell's recount the life and the adventures of this remarkable man is an enjoyable read.

After reading this book, you'll wonder why we have so few people like Burton today."},{"Title":"Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton","review":"Richard Francis Burton lived a fantastic life packed full of enough exploits, adventures, and accomplishments to make any ten men famous. As such, no single biography is sufficient to capture the whole man, and anyone truly interested in exploring his amazing life will do well to read several treatments of it. That said, Byron Farwell's excellent biography of Burton is an outstanding place to begin.Farwell captures Burton's driven, restless spirit, from his wild youth wandering nomadically about Europe with his family, to his old age, when gout and heart disease finally put an end to his adventuring, leaving him to his literary explorations which continued to the day before his death. His years in the Sind soldiering for the East India Company, his mastery of twenty-nine languages, immersion into Eastern ways and culture, adventures and explorations in Arabia and Africa are all thoroughly covered without bogging down into unnecessary detail. Likewise covered are the frustrating years of unofficial exile by his government to forsaken consulate posts on the West African coast and in Brazil, years of brooding, bitterness, and dark depression. And finally, the long twilight of his life as the consulate at Trieste is explored, where failing health slowed his restless travels, but allowed him the time to complete literary treasures, such as his unmatched annotated translation of The Arabian Nights, or his original Sufi poem The Kasidah.Farwell paints Burton's life on a grand scale - capturing not only his outstanding adventures, explorations, and impressive anthropological and literary accomplishments, but his prejudices, his drinking problems and dark moods, his often difficult personality, and other flaws that were writ just as large as his positive accomplishments. Farwell's frank and honest appraisal of Burton, warts and all, go a long way toward explaining why this giant among men was continually slighted by the Government he served, and never recognize or rewarded in proportion to his outstanding service.No biography of Burton can ignore his odd marriage to Isabelle Arundell. Isabelle has often been demonize, her influence on Burton question, and her burning of his papers after his death condemned as foulest crime. Farwell, however, shows great sympathy to Isabelle. She emerges as odd, romantic, devout, and utterly devoted to a husband who was also her hero. Farwell makes it clear that she was a good match for Burton, and powerful force behind the scenes in his career.This is a first rate biography of a unique and amazing life. I recommend it highly.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Burton;: A biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton","review":"Byron Farwell's BURTON- A Biography of Sir Richard Francis Burton brings to life one of the world's great adventurers whose brilliant work in the 19th century encompassed everything from Zoology to great geographical discovery to literature. He was the one who translated the exciting with The Arabian Nights to the excitable erotic of The Perfume Garden. He was a brave and sometimes fool hardy fighter, a gifted poet, a learned diplomat, a remarkable linguist and a student of religions (plural), who could wield an educated passage or verse as well as a much practiced sword.If you need to have the visual to grab and hold onto and perhaps see something more of his life (granted: a Hollywood look) then rent Mountains of the Moon after you've read this truly fine book.There are few real adventurer/scholars out there to study, appreciate or admire. Many have a mad,excited glee about them eagerly going into the realm of danger or the unknown in order to write about the subject or simple bring some light to the journey.

Besides the main mystery plot of the murder, the romance between Althea and Nicholas is sweet and poigant."},{"Title":"The gazebo (Her A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"Poor Althea Graham, a twenty seven year old spinster, is dominated by her hypochondriac mother, who wants nothing more for her surprisingly pretty daughter than to have her at her beck and call, waiting on her hand and foot. Just five years before, Althea had been happy and in love with Nicholas Carey, a childhood friend whom she had known all her life. When her mother found out that the romance was leading towards marriage, her mother had no compunction about laying on a guilt trip, and using her phony invalidism as her trump card. Nicholas Carey, being human, finally had enough of Mrs. Graham's unreasonable shenanigans and Althea's spinelessness, and left, seeking greener pastures as a foreign correspondent.Now five years later, he returns home, and Althea, now just a shadow of her former self, resuscitates, and she and Nicholas are determined to be married. Unfortunately, Mrs. Graham has other ideas. On the day that they are to be married, Mrs. Graham inconveniently turns up dead, murdered in the gazebo that is in her yard. Lucky for Althea that Miss Maud Silver, a retired governess turned private enquiry agent, is an acquaintance of hers, since all the evidence points to Nicholas Carey.This is an intricately plotted mystery with interesting, well-drawn characters and some intriguing sub-plots. All gets neatly woven together in a most enjoyable and satisfying mystery. Though the discerning reader may well deduce just who the murderer is, the joy of this well-written murder mystery is to be found in the journey to its final destination rather than the destination itself. Miss Silver with her insight into human nature, as always, brings much to the table. Those who like murder mysteries, as well as those who are fans of Miss Silver, will thoroughly enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The gazebo (Her A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"Quite a few suspects and a nasty murder--but the victim was really asking for it.

I also got tired of the wishy-washy women that Miss Silver comes across. Althea is lack-lustre character, and Mrs. Blount is almost too cowed to be believed. But there are other good characters in the book. The three Pimm sisters are quite wonderful (your typical English village busybodies). And there is Miss Silver and her dear friend Frank Abbot. A very tiresome woman is found dead in her summerhouse or gazebo, and it's up to Miss Silver to find out the real motive and the real killer. Kind of ho-hum actually, but some of the characters pull this book out of doldrums."},{"Title":"The gazebo (Her A Miss Silver mystery)","review":"The 29th book (of 32) in the cozy mid-century Miss Silver series is a very decent read if you haven't read the previous 28. It isn't bad if you have - I've been reading them in order for a couple of months - but there are just so many recycled plot devices that I get distracted trying to figure out which book(s) already had: a hypochondriac, a dutiful and downtrodden daughter, a disappearing and reappearing suitor, a victim or would-be victim about to be shoved off a traffic island, a hidden treasure, gossiping neighbors...it seems as if every aspect of this book has already been handled in one or more previous novels. That's on top of the cozy framework that was established at the beginning and can be relied upon to brace each book: lots of people with motives for murder, several sub-plots, star-crossed young lovers, and our infallible private enquiry agent, Miss Maud Silver. Miss Silver is an elderly but ageless woman who shows in appearance and character all the traits of a Victorian governess. Scotland Yard Inspector Frank Abbott is also on hand, to be in awe of Maud's powers of deduction. Some of the characters in this book are so annoying that I would have been just as happy if they'd all been knocked off, and the mildly humorous touches that pleased in earlier books no longer pleases in this one. The whole series ran from 1928 to 1961; this was copyrighted 1955, when the author was in her late 70s. I won't say she lost her touch, but I think she relied too much on what worked before. If you haven't read any Miss Silver mysteries in a while, you will probably enjoy this well enough. If you've never read any, you may like it, though I'd recommend others to start. But if you've read many of the books, and especially if you've read them recently, you may want to skip this entry.

Galloway portrays her as such a strong, independent woman with a fiercely stubborn streak, yet also having such compassion and tenderness towards her husband Robert. Clara arranges her concert tours, organizes the household, writes her own music, teaches students, tends to her ailing husband, and manages to produce eight children! No easy feat. Whether her independent streak was forced on her by the shortcomings of Robert, or by her fiercely dictatorial father is unclear. Galloway hints that it was probably a mixture of both.During all this time Clara's life was bound up with her husband's and they were separated only by the exigencies of her profession. She devoted herself not only to his society, but also the to bringing out of his music much of which owed its reputation to her. The story gives us a powerful overview of her life from her time as a child and a musical prot&eacute;g&eacute;e under the tutelage of her strict and authoritarian father. Then we move onto her meeting, strained courtship and eventual marriage to Schumann. The novel is also notable for introducing us to many of the other composers of the period - Chopin, Brahms and Mendelssohn - all friends and respected colleagues of Clara and Robert Schumann.Clara is a beautifully and passionately written love story, and Galloway writes in a style that blasts us with images of their profound and very deep love. Her work is extremely ambitious in its scope - using threads from their music, letters, diaries, and itineraries, and also incorporating a type of \\"stream of consciousness\\" where we are see into the minds of the main protagonists. Galloway creates piece of work that is absolutely breathtaking in scope and complexity, and a real challenge to read.But the novel is so much more than a love story. The reader constantly is bombarded with images from the Victorian era: the musical community of the 1800.s; the sites of Leipzig, Vienna and the other cities if the area; the sounds of the performances; the smells of the cities; the sexual attitudes, childbirth, and the domestic and household life of the period. Galloway's research is indeed meticulous and I'm sure the reader will find a lot to appreciate in this fine piece of work. Clara isn't an easy novel to read, but I'm sure that if the average reader sticks with it, they will be richly rewarded and they will finish having an interesting insight into the life of the wife of one of the world's greatest composers.Michael"},{"Title":"Clara : A Novel","review":"Clara Schumann's (1819-1896)life continues to fascinate and inspire. I recently saw the world-premiere of an opera, also titled &quot;Clara&quot; at the University of Maryland by the American composer Robert Convery. Clara Schumann is the subject of an excellent website and of recent biographies, including &quot;Clara Schumann: the Artist and the Woman&quot; by Nancy Reich. Clara Schumann's compositional output consists of only about 60 works, but it continues to be recorded and performed.Janice Galloway's novel, &quot;Clara&quot; (2002), introduces the reader to a remarkable woman and to her times. Clara was the daughter of Frederick Wieck, a notable piano teacher, and of a woman who left Wieck to marry another man when Clara was young. Clara Wieck was a child prodigy with virtuosic ability at the piano. At the time, the role of piano virtuoso was just coming into its own.Clara fell in love with the great romantic composer Robert Schumann (1810-1856), ten years her senior, when Schumann was a student of Wieck. Her father bitterly opposed the marriage, but the couple persevered and were married with permission from the German courts. The marriage was difficult, as Robert needed absolute quiet in order to compose and was moody and tempramental to say the least. The couple had eight children, and Clara proved determined to pursue her calling as a concert artist. Schumann's instability gradually lead to insanity and he was institutionalized for the last years of his life following a failed suicide attempt. The novel covers Clara's life up through the death of Robert Schumann with only brief allusions to her life as a concert pianist following his death. Clara outlived Robert by 40 years.This book presents a complelling picture of lives filed with the love of music. Robert was a highly gifted composer while Clara devoted her great talents to the art of interpretation. Ms. Galloway shows well the vicissitudes of the creative life, both for the composer and the interpreter. The book is love story, rarer than might be supposed in today's world, presenting a picture of a gifted couple's devotion to each other. In particular, it presents a compelling portrait of Clara Schumann with her devotion to a difficult individual through his descent into psychosis.Ms. Galloway stays close to the facts of her story, gets inside her characters, and avoids the temptation to judge or to editorialize based upon the values of another age. She presents balanced portraits of the characters in her story and allows the reader to see the nuances and ambiguities inherent in all human conduct. For example, Ms. Galloway lets the reader see that Wieck had a point, after all, in his doubts about the marriage and about Robert's mental instability which was surely visible over the years. Ms. Galloway also points out Clara's growing devotion to what she was born to do -- play the piano -- and how her independence sometimes rested uneasily with her love and commitment to Robert. Her love for Robert was surely the most important force in her life.The novel moves slowly at times, but it builds as it progresses in both writing style and in depth of understanding. The novel does an outstanding job in linking the events of Clara and Robert's lives into their music. I enjoyed the treatment of Robert Schumann's &quot;Carnaval&quot;, a great work for the solo piano and a favorite of mine, his song cycles, piano concerto, symphonies, and other compositions which receive thoughtful attention in the book.The paperback edition of this book includes some good questions suitable for book groups together with a revealing interview with Ms. Galloway. The book shows how music and creativity enable people to reach the best of what is in them and to transcend the pain of sorrow and suffering and the banalities of the everyday. I found this book a moving presentation of the love of a woman and a man for each other and of the love of both for music. I was both inspired by the story of Clara's life and also moved to revisit Clara's music and the music of her tormented but gifted husband."},{"Title":"Clara : A Novel","review":"With single-minded determination, born from years of mental discipline, thirty-seven-year-old Clara Wieck Schumann, dressed in black, took the arm of her friend, Johannes Brahms, and was escorted to the piano, where she would begin a new phase of her life, as a widow and the sole support of the eight children she bore composer Robert Schumann. Clara was well schooled for her life of self-denial and duty. A brilliant pianist and former child prodigy, she had been controlled by her domineering father, and she had had to sue him so that she could marry Robert Schumann, an unstable composer whose own demons exerted control over her life.Robert Schumann's instability, according to the author, began at a very early age. As a young man, he believed that he was inhabited by two people, Florestan and Eusebius, and he often alternated marathon composing sessions (once producing 27 pages of music in a single day) with times in which he could find no inspiration at all. He had to have silence when he was working, and he was inconsistent in his behavior, often blaming Clara for small infractions over which she had no control. She had no life of her own. She was the primary bread-winner in the family, giving concerts regularly, despite the arrival of eight babies and the difficulty of practicing without disturbing Robert. Unappreciated and unrecognized by the public, Robert became frustrated and depressed, eventually admitting himself to an asylum, where he died in 1856, at age 46.The ill-starred love story of Clara and Robert Schumann is as romantic as the music of Schumann and his contemporaries, but Galloway keeps this novel on a factual level, as much as possible. There are no flights of fancy here, no imaginative soaring into the stratosphere of romance, and no attempt to recreate the passionate feeling of their love or of their music. She has done enormous research into their lives and presents her novel as if time and circumstance are being filtered through the consciousness of Clara, her father, or Robert. Her recreation of domestic situations and scenes, combined with what the various participants have said about them in their (real) diaries and journals allow her to reflect their inner turmoil while remaining fairly objective as a historian.Galloway's novel is thoroughly researched, full of information about the Schumanns, and sympathetic to Clara's enormous personal burdens. She is largely successful in bringing Clara to life. We never see Robert as a \\"normal\\" person, however, and the reader remains at a distance from him, observing, rather than feeling, what is happening to him. Yet Clara lived for forty years after Robert's death, and this reader would have appreciated a brief Afterword telling what she did during that time. Tied inextricably to Robert throughout their marriage, one can only wonder if she eventually found happiness on her own after his death. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Clara : A Novel","review":"Galloway's two previous novels were superb, but the ambitious &quot;Clara&quot; establishes her as a major writer of our time. Prodigious research allowed her to write Clara Schumann's story as if from within--as though she were a member of the Schumann household telling the story in a 19th-century coffeehouse. The style is colloquial and dramatic, like a barroom raconteur's. Galloway is aware of the repressive social customs that held Clara's abilities back--a few times she sneaks in the phrase &quot;a room of one's own&quot;--but doesn't allow ideology to mar the story.Fans of the Schumanns' music and of innovative contemporary fiction will find much here to sing about."},{"Title":"Clara : A Novel","review":"I appreciated this well-structured novel but did not prefer it to another novel with the same subject, Longing by J.D. Landis. The author makes some interesting choices, such as writing in an impressionistic matter. However, I definitely feel that although the book is alive with detail of 19th century musical life, the book loses some appeal b/c it completely seems to characterize Clara as a victim of both her father and Robert. Both men are presented as villians in most points of the book. Even though you could argue that the book is balanced (b/c we are shown how life is like through Robert's eyes) there seems to clear agenda of showing how Clara was forced to give up her musical career, when in fact she did not completely give it up in real life.But that is just one flaw in the book that I found, whcih does not diminsh the book's strengths, especially its detailed portrait of an era and what it is like to be a musical genius. I actually preferred the portion of the book devoted to Clara's childhood-Fascinating stuff!Wish the book has gone on to describw what Clara's life was like after Robert's death.

But there is no doubt that at the end one is left by the unforgettable image of a terrible situation. Bullied by her monstrous father in childhood and young womanhood into becoming a great musician in her own right, Clara Wieck does at last escapes him into marriage with Robert Schumann. He adores her and she is devoted to him. As Robert's mental condition deteriorates to the point where he has to go into an asylum, Clara's devotion never falters. If he says the most terrible things about her, she is convinced that he does not mean them (and in a way that is true, since Robert is in desperate need of her love and support), while at the same time she refuses to accept the severity of his mental illness. Though others can visit Robert in the asylum, doctors refuse Clara access to her husband until he is at the point of death. There is of course much more to the story, including a brilliant career as a pianist and seven children. But the painful story of her childhood and marriage holds centre stage"},{"Title":"Clara : A Novel","review":"This is quite a gorgeous book -- but difficult!

Existing outside of the Confederation, it's a place that allows everything the Confederation doesn't including the \\"heretical\\" technologies of nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and artificial intelligence. Everything except a central state.To Bakunin comes Colonel Dacham, officer of the Terran Executive Command - the real power in the Confederacy, an organization routinely willing to kill thousands to preserve the governments of its members. In tow are several Confederation Marines under his command. What the TEC wants on Bakunin is unclear. But Dacham's personal motives aren't. He wants to destroy Dominic Magnus, a local arms dealer, and anybody working for him. And one of those marines is increasingly uncomfortable with the lengths he's willing to go - in an already legally unprecedented operation - to do so.Throw in a computer hacker caught up in the TEC's mission of destruction, a bored alien looking to put his encyclopedia knowledge of space navies to use, a safecracking lawyer and ex-revolutionary, a junkyard operator and his robot, and you have most of the cast. Again, Swann exhibits a near-perfect sense of pace in his tale of political intrigue and military action that, in its final phase, turns out to be a heist plot. Swann stretches his revelations out just long enough build suspense and doesn't try our patience by trying to hide mysteries the reader has already guessed.But the real star here is Bakunin, the setting. It's not an anarchic, libertarian utopia. It's full of extortion rackets, violent religions, street punks, and mercs. But it does plausibly, if violently, work after its own fashion. Along with Donald Westlake'sAnarchaos, it's one of science fiction's most vivid anarchies.The chapter headings and epigrams, real and fictitious, are also a big reason I like this series, like it enough to re-read it.The Hostile Takeover trilogy takes place after Swann's moreau books, but you don't have to read them first. However, I have a feeling that the ties between this series and Swann's new series that opened withProphets: Apotheosis: Book Onewill be more significant."},{"Title":"Say It in Danish (Dover Language Guides Say It Series)","review":"This is the best language book I've ever bought, and I speak good German and Spanish in addition to English. I picked this book up used for [cheap] at a cozy bookstore in historic Julian, CA. Frustrated to death with tapesets that have no booklets, booklets that are impossible to read, rote memorization of \\"vocab\\" lists that aren't used in conversation-- this book was a refreshing alternative. As someone who speaks English and German, Danish was an easy-to-comprehend mixture of the two. The book starts out with hundreds of common phrases \\"I'm from America\\" \\"I'm here on business,\\" \\"Where can I find good theaters...\\" and then introduces more vocabulary words. They've brought out all the essentials of the language, in a clear, pocket-size manual you can carry around in your shirt pocket while bicycling Europe. If you get one Danish book, get this one-- and buy some others from the set. Say it in Japanese, Say it In Norwegian, Say It in German, Turkish, Arabic, French... the list is comprehensive. All the books follow the same excellent model. I totally disagree with the reviewer who hated the phonetic symbols. What's so hard about the shwah (backwards e), long a, short a, etc.? Any high-school grad should understand these symbols. It's the ONLY way to communicate pronunciation clearly. That's why dictionaries use it. Can you understand the dictionary? However, her recommendation of the other tapes was helpful... maybe I should check those out!"},{"Title":"Say It in Danish (Dover Language Guides Say It Series)","review":"This pocket size book attempts to teach the reader basic phrases and sentences in Danish by printing them phonetically in English.

So unless you are an English major and understand the meaning of these american language symbols- you will never understand this book. Also, even when you try to figure out what all the symbols mean- the pronunciation that you end up with sounds nothing like the danish word.

Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche (Karma Lodro Ringluk Marwe Sengge) is obviously a modern master; who better to comment upon Wangchuk Dorje's (1555-1603) book? I have read several of Thrangu Rinpoche's works (e.g. \\"The 9th Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning\\" and \\"Essentials of Mahamudra\\") and they are all high quality works. If you want to read a book on Mahamudra, it's hard to beat him in quality, readability, sensitivity, etc. If someone asked me to recommend a Mahamudra author, it would be him. Interestingly, he has also authored (published in 2004) a commentary on \\"The Ocean of Definitive Meaning\\" entitled: \\"The Ocean of Ultimate Meaning\\" (which I own, but have not yet read) though he previously published a commentary on it entitled \\"The Ninth Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning.\\" The 9th Karmapa, one of the greatest of Mahamudra masters (maybe the greatest) wrote 3 texts. In addition to the two mentioned already, there is also \\"Eliminating the Darkness of Ignorance\\" which has been translated by Alex Berzin with commentary by Beru Khyentze Rinpoche and is also presently available."},{"Title":"Pointing Out the Dharmakaya","review":"This is a very clear presentation of the Mahamudra system, and how to get started. As it is said, \\"More important than the main practice, are the preliminaries\\". All these books about Mahamudra are only effective when we have worked out the preliminary practices, and we have established the connection with the Lineage. Without confidence and trust in the masters of the Lineage, reading the books is like \\"driving\\" a car without starting it. It may seem funny, but this is what most of us do, because we don't have genuine confidence in the Lineage Holders and the Teachings. We are only \\"virtual practitioners\\", very learned, with a good intellectual level, with plenty of books on our bookshelves. This concise guide can help us to see our natural face, but only if we take it seriously, and put it into practice."},{"Title":"Pointing Out the Dharmakaya","review":"I enjoyed this treatment of the Mahamudra view of meditation.

While the story line is fairly &quot;heavy&quot;, the development of the &quot;plot&quot; is imaginative and delightful, making this a very enjoyable reading experience. One can almost believe in the actual existence of talking and dancing cats as well as Spam-loving bears - they come to life as observers of the world around them, offering support and insight when they are most needed. If read straight through in one sitting, the reader could overlook some of the profound truths as they are revealed. Betsy Howie demonstrates extraordinary insight into woman's truggle with the true meaning of life, love, and happiness in this ever-changing world. I could easily identify with the woman in the story, and thus found answers to some of my own questions and struggles. I await in eager anticipation for further books by Betsy Howie!"},{"Title":"Snow (Uncorrected Proof)","review":"In the dead of winter, her marrige over, a young woman leaves the city with her two cats and drives north with little more than a few cans of Spam and the vague hope of reinventing herself from ground zero. Outside all is white, but inside, her live begins to unfold before her in vivid color. Wishes can come true in the cabin - but will Vinny the cat's one special wish finally help the woman find her way to a true sense of peace? A very surreal book, sometimes confusing, but never dull. The two cats - clever, talkative Vinny, who claims to have had thousands of past lives; the innocent, quiet dancer Sophie - and a dull witted yet loyal polar bear named Simon provided the humor, and the woman was a powerful, inspiring character. Unusual, but worth reading."},{"Title":"Snow (Uncorrected Proof)","review":"Lots of people beat stress by turning to large bodies of water. They swim, they fish, they daydream on these waters. The Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf--they each have calming properties. But our heroine hasn't heard of the healing properties of blue water, so she turns to an isolated cabin practically buried in the snow. Her healing starts when physical pain from the cold snow intrudes on the life of her mind. Each of her split personalities pulls together as she first succombs to her inner pain then triumphs over it. Survival in a snow bound cabin becomes her first priority. The reader is asked to make a tremendous suspension of disbelief in order to accept the heroine's cat with split personalities too. But if you can accept that she talks to herself as one of several personnas, then why not her cat?"},{"Title":"Snow (Uncorrected Proof)","review":"Betsy Howie's Snow took me a few pages to get into -- she starts without providing the context upon which we readers tend to depend. I also feared that the book would be an angst-filled and self-absorbed ramble...it starts out feeling that way. After 20 pages, I was hooked. With creativity, humor, and heart, Howie takes us through a woman's self-discovery and her meeting of herself. There were moments when I felt I had lost the storyline, but that was due to my concrete thinking rather than any fault of the author. She asks the reader to stretch reality, break out of the dictates of linear time and one-dimensional experience, and imagine an inner world as real and tangible as the one we usually think of as &quot;reality.&quot; I loved the cat, Vinny, who gently encourages the narrator on her journey of self-discovery. I loved that Vinny, himself, ended up learning about self-acceptance, truth, and happiness. I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Snow (Uncorrected Proof)","review":"I'm usually a good judge of which books I'll love, but not this time. My friend warned me that Snow quickly disolves into psychobabble, but was worth reading for the cat antics. Right she was! Perhaps I didn't feel well the day I began reading this annoying book, but within the first 20 pages, I hated it. It was hard to finish, but I was intrigued with the unusual talents the cats displayed, and I kept hoping the story would become less uncomfortable to read. It just had no flow. The subject matter did not bother me, but the way it was written did. I hardly ever read a book I don't want to finish, but this one was a struggle. To the author's credit, I found Vinny and Sophie the cats very charming. Perhaps Ms. Howie's next book will be easier on the nerves."},{"Title":"DISEASES OF LIVESTOCK","review":"This is a very useful book for when we can't have a lab close by and have to rely on clinical diag. of farm animals. Also very good for a vet student. I have used it many times in the field, it's heavy to carry around but well worth the trouble.

Much of his poetry has a \\"familiar\\" feel to it, though not derivative. He speaks as a child when describing the Sleeping Giant, a small mountain in Hamden, CT, where, if one is in the right spot, the head, chest and feet of the \\"giant\\" can be imagined. He grew up in Hamden, CT, but his grandfather's home in the New Hampshire mountains helped shape his view of life, as well. In \\"Old and New Poems\\" his changing viewes of life over the years are seen.In the poem \\"1934\\" he reminds the reader of life during the Great Depression, and the fears it engendered.His poetry reminds readers of ordinary day to day activities. He writes of his father and grandfather reminiscing \\"In the Kitchen of the Old House\\", where \\"his early death grew inside him, like snow piling on the grass\\".\\"Old and New Poems\\" is very readable, and often autobiographical.

I also felt I was re-reading sections from her husband's book in her book; his words were just changed around a bit. There was nothing new nor were any original ideas presented in the book.She makes reference on why God loves to answer such a prayer as the Jabez prayer. Does that mean that God does not answer other kinds of prayers, and only chooses \\"prayers such as . . .?\\" I think not. She talks of women being very fearful and giving up on miracles in their lives. Well, thoughts have energy and if one constantly thinks fearful thoughts, then fear shows up in our lives. If one does not believe in miracles happening, then they won't. Ernest Holmes, in his ministry, stated, \\"Change your thoughts, change your life.\\" Jesus was able to do what he did, not only because of his faith, but also because of the power of his thoughts. Faith is a huge concept.The feeling I get after reading this book is that if one says this prayer then the miracles unfold. If one doesn't believe, or is skeptical, or has negative thoughts, their lives will not change. The author also talks about supporting one's husband. How about the husband supporting his wife's career? It works both ways and spousal support is not just \\"one\\" way. Have I stepped back into the 50's here? Satan is also mentioned in her book, which, in my review of the Prayer of Jabez, is getting old. We have free will, which God has given us. Our choices need to be held accountable by the person who made them and not blamed on someone else.She also makes reference that we have to realize that Jesus died for payment our sins and once we accept that we are saved. I think not. God's Spirit is with us always and if one does or does not accept the above statement, it does not mean that God will not bless us. We are God's expression on earth. We are already whole and complete and we are loved always. I am really tired of reading \\"Christian\\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on. This book also does not talk about a forgiving and loving God, which is very disappointing.She also talks ad nauseum on fear, on women's fears. Sure we all have fears, but again we either give into them or change them. It makes me wonder that as a minister's wife, she is so filled with fear, where is her supportative husband? Does she feel that insecure? Has her husband not helped to boost her self-confidence or has she been put down and made to feel insecure. Makes one wonder.This book was just as bad as the original, if not worse. Another disappointment."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women video workbook: Breaking Through to the Blessed Life (Additional Video Series from Global Vision Resources)","review":"I found this book to be insightful, though not quite as good as Secrets of the Vine (written by her husband, Bruce). Darlene Wilkinson gives the Prayer of Jabez a slightly different spin, putting her perspective on it. But beware of several items: 1) this is written from her perspective, so don't presume that all she says will apply or even make sense from yours; and 2) asking for God to enlarge your territory doesn't necessarily mean make you rich. I noticed a few other reviewers of Bruce Wilkinson's book thought that it meant make me rich. I took it to mean, make me more effective for Your kingdom, Lord, by taking me out of my comfort zone (my territory). Just as King Solomon prayed for wisdom and God, because He was pleased with his request, made him the richest king of all time, so with Jabez. The very same day I began my 30 day trial (I am still in it, by the way), God granted my wish by opening a position at my church for me to minister through serving. The Lord has truly blessed me through this prayer. It is 100% effective if you keep your eyes open and don't expect physical riches. For me, the riches I am seeking are those to be found in my eternal home. Though I'm not going to turn down any earthly riches if that is God's plan!"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women video workbook: Breaking Through to the Blessed Life (Additional Video Series from Global Vision Resources)","review":"I would have enjoyed this book more if I had not already read The Prayer of Jabez by Bruce Wilkinson.

What I found out is that God wants to bless us, not according to our worthiness but because we know He will answer our prayers.Wherever you are is your territory to bless others and glorify God. God will use you to benefit others, bless others, according to His perfect plan. We need to remove our limits on what we can do and who we can become to glorify God. God wants us to have a bigger impact on the lives of others by expanding our network of influence to reach others for Christ.On page 42, Darlene states a process to help us along in our Jabez Prayer:*Ask God to let me do more for him.*Aim to be available to those around me.*Approach surprise encounters as potential Jabez Appointment.*Acknowledge it's about God's agenda, not mine.I believe that if we are tired, overwork and stressed we are not living the prayer of Jabez because God always leaves us exhilarated, not exhausted.I would recommend this easy to read book to anyone who wants to feel like they are doing more for Christ as we are His Servants on earth.

Spurgeon's grasp and use of the English language is amazing and even when using 3 and 4 syllable words, he makes you feel he is extending his hand to you and offering you a step up on a higher plane without being an academic or worse---spiritual elitist.

I recently completed a book review for this for my M.Div degree and when I was asked to critique part of it, or find something to be at fault, I shuddered to think who am I to criticize anything this great man of God ever did.

By the age of 17, he was already adept enough in the Word of God that he was called to shepherd one of the local churches. During his lifetime, he published over 1900 different sermons. Each was original and thought-provoking. Those who have read his sermons know that each message was filled with the Word of God and sought to bring honor and glory to Christ alone. The teaching done by Spurgeon in these 28 lectures is a skill that has almost completely vanished from among pastor-teachers today. This 443 page book reflects just one reason why he was called, &quot;The Prince Of Preachers&quot; and &quot;A Master Pulpiteer.&quot; Spurgeon's teachings and messages will go on in Christendom as being revelant to any age in any decade. The ministerial student will do well to study these lectures and seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in applying them to their ministry. The experienced minister should also take the time out of often hectic schedules to study what made this &quot;Prince of Preachers&quot; a prince among preachers. No minister should ever be able to find fault with this classic. This contents of this book and the author should never be considered to be &quot;out-of-date&quot; and &quot;not up-to-par in this modern world.&quot; It is a timely piece which I thoroughly enjoyed. I would highly recommend it be read over and over again."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"This book is a classic, and should be a part of every Christian's library. What an encouragement and inspiration. This book has not lost any of its touch, even though the messages C.H. Spurgeon gave in it are over a hundred years old. Rather, he reveals why today's modern spiritualism is no match to the true power of God, encouraging us to WALK YE IN THE OLD WAYS and to GO BY THE OLD. PATHS."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"\\"Affectation of intellectual superiority and love of rhetorical splendour have prevented many from setting forth gospel truth in the easiest imaginable manner, namely, by analogies drawn from common events. Because they could not condescened to men of low estate hey have refrained from repeating incidents which would have accurately explained their meaning. Fearing to be thought vulgar, they have lost goldne opportunities. As well might David have refused to sling one of the smooth stones at Goliath's brow because he found it in a common brook.\\"Thus, we catch a glimpse of the practical wisdom, which so easily dripped from the pen of Charles Spurgeon, in the preceding quote. It is but a small portion of the witty, yet solid, insights he gives in his work Lectures to My Students. Although this book is intended for those would be pastors and elders who are picking up the mantle of God's preachers, there are great principles of biblical and practical truth which can be applied to any Christian's life. On that basis alone I approvingly recommend this read to all.Spurgeon's mastery and command of the English language did not keep him from \\"setting forth gospel turth in the easiest imaginable manner\\". In fact, with such an ability, he was one of the most avid communicators of his day, and even to this time. I've heard it said before that had Spurgeon's voluminous writings been \\"unrelgious\\" in nature, they would've been indeed used to exemplify the best of English language. Spurgeon has been affectionately called the Prince of Preachers, and rightly so, for his eloquence of speech was music to the ears of both the common man and well-to-do.In Lectures to My Students, Spurgeon's subject matter ranges anywhere from Vocal demonstration and care to \\"The Minister's Self-Watch\\". It would behoove anyone who \\"desires the office of an Elder\\" to get a copy of Spurgeon's Lectures and make use of the matter found therein. Spurgeon was indeed a uniquely used individual of God. When it comes to preaching, he was definitely exceptional, not typical. Would it be that God would grant us more Preachers such as he!"},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and recommend it for anyone in the ministry or entering the ministry. There are countless gems of insight and anecdotes by Spurgeon of his own experience, fellow ministers, and great men of God in days gone by. Each section is a precise snapshot of how old school, revival, God-entranced, Word-centered, Spirit-empowered ministry should be. There is great inspiration to be found here that challenges you to go deeper in your personal devotion in order to be more fruitful publicly. But what really amazed me was the practical advice that was given in every area of ministry from private to public prayer to sermon writing and delivery. Very insightful; and I am thankful to have gleaned these truths from the prince of preachers. The first 6 chapters are particularly captivating as they describe the essence of the minister and what his character and he in himself should be. Also worthy of special note is the chapter near the end on spiritual depression of the pastor/preacher; it is quite valuable.This is one of my top 5 books. All of Spurgeon's works are worth the effort and resources to secure (such as his autobiography, commentary on Psalms called Treasury of David, salvific work titled All of Grace, and monumental 63 volume sermon set :), but that is not always feasible. If you were to have only one book by Spurgeon, I would say this should be it.As has been said in the other more negative reviews: the presentation is not that great (this is the bibliobazar edition). The book itself looks very clean and sharp; it's a good size too, which I appreciate (just has a good hold and feel in your hands as you read). BUT, the type size is extremely small and the font is just okay. There are little spot marks and smudges in some places (though the text remains legible), due to the book being a photocopy of an earlier print. Also, this is only the first volume of what is a 4 volume set (comprised of Lecture Series 1,2, and 3 and \\"Commenting and Commentaries\\"), the whole of which can be found here on Amazon in one convenient edition. Just search for the ISBN 978-0851519661 and you'll find it (notice the page count compared to all the others; the complete version clocks in at a whopping 911 pages). The full edition is produced by Baker and is very high quality.Lastly, as this material dates back to the 1800s and is therefore open source, free PDFs of each Lectures series are available. Just search \\"lectures to my students pdf\\" and they should come up."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"Three things that I really appreciate about this book, are its candor, practicality, and humor. One very rarely finds a 19th century man who could communicate truths like these in such a way. In Lectures to My Students, Spurgeon gives indespensible advice to those going into the ministry about how to be an effective preacher. This book is a must have for those called to preach the Gospel and it is a fun read as well. God bless you."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"This is an abriged edition (although it says unabriged in the product description) and the print is VERY small."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"These are great lectures by Spurgeon, but the format of the book is very poor. It is a photo reproduction of one of the original editions and the type is VERY small and hard to read. There are other editions, Eerdmans for example, that are much better for a similar price."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"At least the first chapter anyway. The first thing he tells his students in this book is to watch out for your own soul- i.e. see to it that you are a partaker in Whom you are preaching. An exellent book, a little much on the interjection of Latin phrases for this day and age, but still worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"Lectures to My Students (In Japanese)","review":"Title: Lectures to My StudentsAuthor: Charles H.

According to Spurgeon's comments in his introduction, this request came from former ministerial students who had sat and listened to those lectures.There is no central theme to this book. The book is divided into three \\"series\\" which contain a number of lectures on various themes. The first series contains thirteen chapters, the second series contains ten chapters, and the third series contains seven chapters. Each chapter deals with a particular theme related to the pastoral ministry.Pastor Spurgeon used both exposition and argumentation to develop the various themes that he taught his students. Spurgeon was very committed to explain various parts and responsibilities of the pastoral ministry to his students.In evaluating this book, I found it to be very interesting and helpful. It was written in the tone, spirit, and language of 19th century England. Yet each chapter is filled with pertinent and relevant information that can be beneficial to pastors today. Those who read these series and this book will find the information to be very useful.I highly recommend this book to every man in pastoral leadership. One would do well to read and study this book. I would say that if one read one chapter a week, maybe on Friday, one would find this material to be both relevant and refreshing.___________________________________I received a free copy of this book for this evaluation.

What sets this book apart from others is that the authors present the material in a fashion that everyone can digest and therefore come to understand the very complex issues surrounding global terrorism.The book fully addressed and shed light on almost 40 topics regarding the war on terrorism. It gave me a greater understand of WHY the U.S. is a target, HOW al Qaeda operates, WHO bin Laden is, HOW the US and its allies can and are responding.Ever wonder about the history of the Arab/Israeli conflicts?, the history of the conflicts in Northern Ireland?, what makes al Qaeda different from other terrorist groups? ...its all in here, and then some.The book lists more more than 40 terrorist groups operating trhoughout the world, what their &quot;cause&quot; is, and the their bases of operation. It identiifes terrorist orgranizations on each continent, and by country. It gives some detail and information about states that sponsor terrorism, and the complex politics involved in each case.Overall, the book is a &quot;must read.&quot; It really gave me a clearer understanding of the global politics in play when it comes to the issue of terrorism.Great detail and facts about:What IS terrorism -its defined in many ways, this book clarifies why different countries and even different parts of the US gov. define it differently.The al Qaeda organization and its global reach,Terrorist operations in: Africa, Middle East, Europe, Latin AMerica, Asia, etc.Terrorism and International Lawand it even presents a balanced viewpoint on the hot issue of Civil Liberties.Overall- I give it 5 stars, and that's because I couldn't give it 6.To the authors -GREAT job!"},{"Title":"Terrorism Factbook: Our Nation at War!","review":"This book is exactly what I was looking for.

This is a thourough historical account that is worth reading."},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"Just finished this and have to say that it was very interesting. I would say that if you have seen the film Pretty Baby, which I believe Louis Malle based on this book, then this is going to be a bit of an eye opener. Like Pretty Baby, the author here seems a bit remote or detached from his subject matter. He does not take a stand or try to force his opinion on the reader. All the material is there to read and form your own opinion. I find this a little uncomfortable.Most of the chapters contain good information even if it is a bit dry. There is a chapter of interviews of the survivors of the Red Light District and I found this to be the most fascinating yet sobering of all. What I really wanted was more of those interviews. The author explains he did not use all of them and I understand his explanation but really, this is the most fascinating chapter.All in all though, after reading this I certainly have a very different opinion about \\"the district\\" and can see why many people were glad it was closed down.Any warm feelings I may have had about \\"the district\\" were certainly chilled after reading this."},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"Storyville is an excellent resource for anyone seeking a sense of what the whole Storyville experience was all about.

The place that music played, and how the madam's promoted the jazz greats, is a wonderful story.

I wish he was still with us."},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"This volume could be the all-time official history of that legendary Red Light District of New Orleans. It is exhaustively researched and illustrated including interviews with some of the surviving colorful characters that inhabited the \\"Camelot of Sin\\" that was Storyville. The den of sin takes its name from Alderman Sidney Story who originated the ordinance that provided for a restricted Red Light District. Ironically, he hated having his good name attached to a Red Light District. Today it's the only way his name is remembered. Prior to his legal restrictions the brothels and parlors were spreading throughout New Orleans like a cancer.Rose illustrated his book with photos, maps, directories, flyers, police reports, legal decisions, cartoons, business cards and almost any other surviving evidence of the now torn down section of the city. The author's research was exhaustive and probably as complete as can be contained in a single book. He combined aerial photos and maps of the area with close-up photos of the exterior and interiors of the many vice businesses. He shows pictures of the interior lushness of some more famous brothels, as well as the filth of some of the cribs. He uses most of the surviving photographic nude and semi-nude portraits that Ernest Bellocq made of some of the prostitutes of the district to make the architectural and interior photos of the bars, dance halls, gambling dens and brothels come to life. Rose also included quite a lot of humor in the form of stories from the time or through his selection of colorful characters to describe in detail. And they were colorful and probably wouldn't have been more colorful or interesting even if their biographies were fictionalized.By the time the reader finishes this book he will feel like he has actually visited Storyville and walked its streets and listened to and witnessed the birth of New Orleans jazz. In fact, Rose does an excellent job of documenting that birth of Jazz and even tracing its spread to the rest of America. The reader will also have been taken step-by-step through the historical reasons that Storyville was a necessary and probably unavoidable development at that time in American history.Storyville no longer exists. It was closed down by the U.S. Military in an attempt to keep sailors, soldiers and marines from contracting venereal diseases. After the buildings were empty they were condemned and torn down to be replaced by more desirable buildings in the classic version of urban renewal. It took the full force of the U.S. Military to destroy Storyville because New Orleans was and had always been too corrupt to accomplish the job. Almost from it's founding, the city was flooded with prostitutes and criminals (convicts) shipped from Europe to settle the colony. The riverboat traffic provided an endless supply of sex-starved customers for the fleshpots at the mouth of the Mississippi River.Like Camelot, Storyville has become a popular legend in the eyes of the population. The legend may indeed become more mythical with the passage of time. Today the very name Storyville can catch the attention of the public and because of that it is frequently used in the titles of fiction and movies.The reader won't feel that he hasn't received a very generous return on his cost for buying this fascinating non-fiction book. The fact is as interesting as the legend."},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"Was surprised at how boring this book was.

Featuring Ernest Bellocq's bittersweet photographs of Storyville's denziens and reproductions of 19th century New Orleans newspapers and gossip sheets this book has a moral for all of us: namely, that the legalization of prostitution can put an end to disease, abuse, and harrassment by johns and the authorities and become a viable part of the economy.\\"Storyville, New Orleans\\" starts out with a brief history of prostitution in the Crescent City and takes the reader on a street-by-street tour of the district created by city aldermen in 1897. Photographs of the girls and their houses are on just about every page and really shows the day-to-day operation of Storyville. In addition, scattered throughout Rose's work are the surviving calling cards and advertisements for each prostitute and her place of business. This includes the \\"Blue Book\\", a sort of Yellow Pages for the lecherous. There is also an extensive chapter on the jazz musicians--professors--who played in the various brothels and bars. Storyville was closed by order of the US Navy in 1917 and Rose shows us what happened to some of the women and many of the buildings.My only problem with this book is that many of the newspaper reproductions--especially that of the full-length Mascot in the back--are hard to read. I first found \\"Storyville\\" in my university library years ago when I was a student researching a paper.

He died in New Orleans thirteen years ago and was given a jazz funeral. He researched Storyville for 14 years. Many of the records had intentionally been destroyed. At the time he began the research he was living in Hollywood, Fl and wanted to paint a mural and map of Storyville on a wall in his home. He was a wonderful artist as well as writer. When he went to find a good map of Storyville and more details he discovered that the records of ownership of the well known houses of prostitution had been razored out of the official deed books. Intrigued by this he went on and on and the result was Storyville. He was a renaissance man: artist, writer, jazz impressario, labor organizer. He fought in the Spanish Civil War and worked with the Quakers to smuggle social democratic leaders out of eastern europe after the soviets took over. He studied under Diego Rivera, knew Trotsky, was a friend and confidant of every great jazz musician of the 20th Century and befriended all of them. I sat in his living room one night while Eubie Blake played the piano. Al wrote his biography and knew him for 50 years. He produced jazz records for the State of Louisina, still much in demand by collectors. The records bear the legend, \\"recorded under the personal supervision of Al Rose.\\" His real name was much longer---he was from a very old New Orleans family and actually has to take fencing lessons in case he had to fight a duel. he would be extremely pleased at the reviews on this site.

Great!"},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red-Light District is written by Al Rose. The author states that the purpose of this book is \\"to give the reader a reasonable true-to-life impression of \`The District'--its people, its music, its press, its rise and decline, its \`ways\\" (1). Rose is not interested in telling myths and rumors. He wants to tell the true story and present only the facts. This book is also not an argument for or against the legalization of prostitution. Through his interviews with former inhabitants of Storyville and historical accounts, the author delivers a powerful message of what life was like for residents living in New Orleans shortly after the turn of the century.This book describes how Storyville began, how life in New Orleans was affected when it was in business, and how it eventually was shut down by the government. Al Rose also includes chapters on the people, music, press, and first hand accounts from some anonymous survivors of storyville. These different chapters help to describe many aspects of Storyville. The author does a thorough job of recounting the events of Storyville. While taking the reader through the history, Rose also includes many photographs, documents, drawings, maps, and excerpts from newspapers of the time. This helps the reader to better understand and visualize the history and show evidence that the author is interested in only telling the true story.Al Rose starts the reader off with an introduction to Storyville. He describes Storyville as the legal red-light district of New Orleans. It existed for nineteen years from January 1, 1898 to November 12, 1917. Storyville was an area defined by law to be used for prostitution and other areas of vice. Lawmakers wanted a way to control and regulate prostitution without having to openly acknowledge it. New Orleans passed an ordinance, and this ordinance initiated the episode of events that created Storyville. The ordinance stated that prostitution was clearly illegal outside of storyville, but neither legal or illegal inside it. The area was later named Storyville by the press after Alderman Story, who helped to write the ordinance that created Storyville. Alderman was mortified and fought with the press for years to change the name. The residents of New Orleans often called Storyville \`the district.' It was only called Storyville by the press and historians.The most informative part of the book is the chapter dedicated to anonymous interviews of people who experienced \`the district' first hand. Rose includes several interviews with many different types of people, with different view points of Storyville. He interviews a \\"Trick Baby,\\" a Pimp, a Man About Town, a Madam, a Crib Woman, a Working Stiff, and a Working Girl. These interview give the reader amazing insight to what it was really like to live in New Orleans while Storyville was open for business. In one interview with the \\"Trick Baby,\\" she describes how she was born in the attic of one of the brothels. Her mother was a prostitute and her father was just another customer of \`the district.' She compares growing up in a brothel to growing up with a father that owns a grocery store. \\"I know it'd be good if i could say how awful it was and like crime don't pay--but to me it seems just like anything else--like a kid who's father owns a grocery store. He helps him in the store. Well, my mother didn't sell groceries\\" (150). These interviews force the reader to imagine what it would be like if they were in that situation. This helps one form their own opinions about prostitution and vice.In another interview with a Man About Town, who was a customer of \`the district,' the man offers a unique insight into how the businesses were run. He states that he has traveled all over the world, and has been to many different \`whorehouses.' He says that Storyville is different from all the other districts that he has been to. He reveals that, \\"The foreign whores, somehow manage to feign an attitude that leads you to believe, at least for the moment of intercourse that you have their attention and that they are interested in seeing that you have a pleasant time\\" (155). He describes them as having pride in workmanship. He compares this experience to his experiences in Storyville, \\"Storyville whores, no matter how well-dressed or how gaudily expensive the whorehouses, were avaricious, greedy, and uncouth. Really low class people, despite the Blue Book ads\\" (155). This contrast helped to reveal the truth about how storyville was run.Rose also talks about this stark contrast between Storyville and how prostitution is done in other places around the world. He compares it to Japan where women raised in the authentic geisha tradition receive a professional training in the sexual arts such as the Kama Sutra. He adds that Storyville was not about art, it was about greed. He describes the women as having no real interest in their customers' enjoyment or satisfaction. All they wanted was the money that the men brought. This helps to realize how unique and different Storyville was for other places that dealt with prostitution.Al Rose writes Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red-Light District as a true account of the events of \`the district.' He uses many primary and secondary sources to describe the attitude of Storyville and its people. He helps the reader to understand that \`the district' was a unique place. The interviews offer an extraordinary view of the lives of the people and how they were affected by Storyville. This book gives a significant understanding of the history and its importance to the reader."},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"Covers the truly bizarre (and lewd) phenomenon of Storyville -- an 1897-1917 experiment with segregating all prostitution in the city into a 4 block x 4 block area. This was obviously a real labor of love. Al Rose appears to have looked under every sheet and peered into every closet. He has amassed a very large collection of interviews, correspondence, printed material, and photos. The final product is interesting, well organized, well illustrated, and well written. It is amazing what he fits into 200 large pages.I'd highly recommend this adult glimpse into a seedier and less discussed element of New Orleans' unique and offbeat culture."},{"Title":"Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District","review":"I first heard about Storyville while researching material for a book I was writing.

First of all, the book delivers exactly what it claims to on the cover. I've read skimpier and more salatious books on Storyville, none of the caliber and detail that this book offers.I've made several tours to the site of Storyville and have found the directions in the book to be valuable and intensifyed my tour experience. The excellant photographs were most helpful."},{"Title":"Salt-water poems and ballads,","review":"I recently bought this book for my wife and had a terrible time finding it (and it was very expensive). She has loved John Masefield for who knows how long (since she was a child) and has shared favorite poems with me from this book. I have also read some of them and they are wonderful poetry and imaginitive enough for all aged readers and some powerful and beautiful enough to bring tears to myself. Highly recommended for anyone who loves the sea. I was lucky enough to find a nice hardcover with paintings that capture some of the sensations of the sea. Poems like \\"Sea Fever\\" are classics that frequently printed elsewhere (and quoted in a Star Trek movie :)), and it should be reprinted and made available in the United States where publishers seem unable to identify what American readers are intelligent enough to comprehend.

I couldn't tell you how many times I checked it out of the library to read and reread again. I even remember where it was -- second shelf from the end, three row up, reddish hardback cover.Over the years I'd forgotten the title, I just remembered that it was about a little Native American girl who climbed a tree and found another world in the sky.

Post-unification Italy's development might well have been less turbulent, had it not been for the distressing tendency of successive kings to interfere in politics and indulge their taste for intrigue. Nurturing the tender plant of Italian democracy was usually the last thing on their minds. As in his other works, Mack Smith wastes little sympathy on the civilian politicians who were, if anything, even more culpable than their royal masters in contributing to Italy's failure to construct a stable, corruption-free democracy before the First World War. But his particular focus is the monarchy, from its crucial part in the wars of unification after 1860 to its inglorious association with Benito Mussolini's dictatorship in the inter-war years. After putting down Mack Smith's book - a gem of concise writing and lightly worn learning - one can only be glad that Italians eventually abolished the monarchy after the Second World War. Republicanism, though drenched in corruption and crime between 1946 and 1992, did at least do something to modernize public life in Italy."},{"Title":"Shakespeare (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: \\"It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'\\""},{"Title":"Shakespeare (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"Highly recommended for someone who has some familiarity with the plays and wants to see this terrain through sharper eyes. This is not \\"CliffsNotes.\\" These are essays by a master critic who loves Shakespeare, written *for* readers who love Shakespeare. But be prepared when Van Doren plays the critic, not the worshipper. If your favorite is \\"Henry V,\\" for example, keep an open mind and wince along.A pleasant aspect of this book is that you can take the essays in any order. This means that if, like me, you know some of the more popular plays (Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Lear, Julius Ceasar), but not some of the seldom-performed ones (Titus Andronicus, Troilus and Cressida, King John, Pericles), you can see what Van Doren has to say about \\"your\\" plays and then come back when you have hunted up the others.Van Doren's prose is familiar, easy, and full of love. It is almost a conversation, and hardly less a joy to read than Shakespeare himself."},{"Title":"Shakespeare (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"I have always loved Shakespeare but, even though I have studied it, sometimes, he is a little difficult to pin down on what exactly he is saying or meaning and it is often hard to get the feel or mood for certain scenes. After all, he was a playwright, not a journalist! And he wrote five centuries ago in the idiomatic English of that time. This critique is absolutely brilliant. Van Doren's feelings on Shakespeare are that he wrote his plays to be enacted on a mostly-bare stage in front of a noisy crowd of Joe Q. Publics, not enacted in an elaborate hushed stage setting in front of a group of phychologist, phychoanalists, etc. I have often felt that some critics see deep, mystical, dark meanings in Shakespeare that he never intended (I feel it is more a reflection of the critic's own phyche). Not to say that Shakespeare is shallow! I feel his &quot;well-written&quot; plays are awesome and unmatched by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Van Doren brings Shakepeare to the light of day in a clear, logical, yet so very elegant way. This book literally brings me to tears, it's so beautiful!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"Articulate, scholarly, yet accessible. A classic I have wanted to have for a long time. Thanks --the service was marvelous."},{"Title":"Shakespeare (Doubleday anchor books)","review":"Professor Van Doren's work is unique in the universe of Shakespeare interpretation and criticism in that it is written in very accessible and familiar language and can be enjoyed as supplementary reading to the plays in almost any order or sequence. Each essay brings some clarity and provokes thought about the text in such a warm and conversational style that it has become the first book I pull off the shelf after completing one of the plays to enjoy the perspective of a fellow lover of Shakespeare. There are so many critical and explanatory texts to choose from and many are very useful but this is the one I'd recommend to a friend who wants to enhance their enjoyment of the Bard."},{"Title":"Sign and Sing Along: Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star","review":"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star - sing and sign along - My granddaughter is learning how to sign with this book.

Why was Annie such a spoiled young imp? Didn't she get any of her step-mother's maturity and demeanor? It was a good story and all but just didn't grasp my attention.

He's surprised to see that their daughter, Anne Trevelyan, has grown into a beautiful young woman. Colin is only visiting for a short time before heading to San Francisco, where he plans to buy a ranch, marry, and settle down. His friends ask him to escort the lovely Anne to San Francisco where they have enrolled her in a finishing school. Although he's concerned about escorting such an attractive woman hundreds of miles, he cannot say no to his friends.Anne is attracted to the handsome Colin, but she's determined to seek fame and fortune as an actress. Her parents are not in favor of her ambitions, which is why they are enrolling her in the finishing school. Anne has other plans though, and surmises all she needs to do is flirt with her companion enough, and he'll allow her to do as she wishes. But when passion rages between them on the trip, Colin wants to marry her. Anne is determined to devote her time to her career, and a husband doesn't fit into the equation.When I picked up this book, I was unfamiliar with this author, but the premise sounded interesting. Unfortunately, this has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. Colin was likeable, but Anne was immature and self-centered. What he saw in her is a mystery to me. The characters were one-dimensional, and never engaged my emotions. I virtually lost interest in the story, and could care less what happened to the characters. Additionally, the writing seemed awkward and didn't flow well. I have no idea why I finished this book, because it was painful to get through even with the skimming I did at times.

Even more shocking is to see how grown up the two youngsters he remembered giving piggyback rides to but especially twenty years old Kate, who is now a beautiful young lady instead of the four year old he remembers.Annie and her father have argued over her future as she wants to be an actress and has turned down several marriage proposals while Trev feels the stage is not a place for a wholesome woman.

On the journey west, Annie plans to seduce Trev into what she wants, but one thing leads to another and soon adult love blossoms between these two unlikely individuals.HIS UNEXPECTED WIFE is an engaging Americana romance due to the gender battle between the dynamic lead couple. The support ensemble provides depth that brings alive the gay nineties in several western locales while showing off author Maureen McKade&#8217;s ability to draw convincing, in-depth characters.

Furthermore, a recent news report stated that the intelligence gathered about the Iranian nuclear program was almost totally wrong. This should not surprise anyone who has paid attention to the history of the organization. In this book, which despite the title is largely about the American CIA rather than the Soviet KGB, you read about many of the ways the CIA has failed.Those failures started almost from the first day the organization existed. There were almost comical attempts to overthrow Enver Hoxha, the communist dictator of Albania. They failed to predict the North Korean invasion of South Korea and they completely overestimated the response of the Cuban people to the invasion of the island at the Bay of Pigs. Their assassination attempts against Fidel Castro were ridiculous and I still remember Senator Edward Kennedy laughing at some of their reported antics during the hearings conducted by the Church committee in the \`70s.The CIA also completely failed to understand how weak the Shah's regime was in Iran and how hated his secret police were, which were largely trained by the CIA. His downfall, like that of the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe was completely unanticipated.The years between 1946 and 1991 are generally called the Cold War, because the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union never reached the point where forces from both sides were shooting at each other. However, to the people in nearly every other place on Earth, the war was very real. We tend to think of the millions that were killed in Korea and Vietnam when exceptions are considered and this is due to the American involvement in those places. Less well known and generally unconsidered are the small, brutal wars where the CIA was involved. Places such as Chile and Argentina, where the CIA backed military coups that led to internal \\"dirty wars\\" when the military forces executed thousands of their opponents.No American citizen can read this book and not be alarmed at the horrendous record that the CIA has amassed over the years. There is an old joke that Central Intelligence Agency is a contradiction in terms and the events recounted in this book make it sound like a truism rather than an attempt at humor."},{"Title":"The Bronze Horseman: Selected Poems of Alexander Pushkin","review":"Pushkin can do prose or poetry.

Maybe the book was written in a hurry in an effort to put out some truth. It would have been nice to have a more well rounded story of what Freddie's life was like growing up, which would have included more information about his father and other aspects of his life. Also, there wasn't that much information on Freddie's then wife Kathy. It would have been nice to have had her input, but as the book stated, it was about a mother and son. I really wish someone would write a more detailed account of Freddie's life, he's missed alot, and many of the fans would enjoy it.

I don't remember reading any of this in the book, but I read this in 'Morbid Curiosity-Celebrity Tombstones Across America'. Quite possibly she figured the readers didn't need ALL the gory details.I don't know--Freddie seemed like a really good guy and a great son, but I did find him demanding and mostly thinking of himself before others. He wanted to get to the top and wouldn't stop until he got there.

That was a shame, too, since I'd bought about a dozen of her books because I was so SURE I would like her. The descriptions of her books sounded right up my alley.In all fairness, I have to say that the book I read did have a child in it, and I usually find books with \\"cute\\" children, well, annoying. So, that could have been the problem. Why do authors persist on having 6-year-old kids speaking like 2-year-old kids? Ick. Stop it!This book was not a romance. In fact, there was very little romance, but there was a lot of sexual tension. I liked it. I liked him, I liked her, I liked her friend, and, yes, I even liked her KID! There was a good enough mystery to make you want to finish the book, and lots and lots of clever dialogue. I love clever dialogue!My major disappointment in this book was finding out there are only 2 or 3 more in the series! Luckily, I have them. I wish the series would have continued on like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books, but that's probably not going to happen ... sniff sniff ..."},{"Title":"Hot Property","review":"I wanted to read all of Sherryl Woods books and have been searching used book stores, several libraries and you had the books"},{"Title":"The Jacket","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!

I'm looking forward to reading more from this author in the future."},{"Title":"The Jacket","review":"When I first started to read the book I started reading it online just to get a feel for the book to see if I would like it. Well after reading the first page I was hooked. It was like a drug that I just had to have more of. I read it anytime of the day whenever I could. I am a lover of thrillers and this is up there with some of the best that I have read. If you are looking for a &quot;Can't put me down book&quot; then you have found one in this book. I would not recommend it for the young readers as it has some explicit scenes. The ending definitely leaves you wanting more... I guess I'll have to wait. Excellent job, Well done."},{"Title":"The Jacket","review":"I was timid while i made the transition from Nancy Drew to horror. Not for long! This book brought me right out of my shell and kept me up for months! This truly spellbinding book took me to places that were so well described I was convinced that I was actually there! since then, I have read many a horror novel but none of them had quite the same suspense and thrill as this one! A deeply horrifingly spooky novel and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a few restless nights, sleeping with one eye open. I am very excited to hear that Charles is making a company out of the main character!"},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I find it odd that someone would pick up a high fantasy book, knowing that it's one, and complain about the magical elements. It's almost the same as picking up \\"Mists of Avalon\\" and complaining that it focused too much on the Arthurian legend. It reads like a different genre from \\"Comfort and Joy\\" because it so obviously *is*.And Jessex is hardly the Mary Sue that the reader above complained about; his overwhelming innocence/naivete, perhaps because of his complete lack of the ability to analyze, I think, is his fatal flaw. It bordered on stupidity and because of it, his world was nearly destroyed when it could have been easily saved, if he only had a pinch more wisdom. It's grating and annoying that he never suspect any of the upcoming events in his life, which any reader of average intelligence will forsee miles away.However, such isn't a complaint against the book itself. The book remained engrossing and enormously beautiful despite, or because of, Jessex, flaws and all. And Mr. Grimsley, imho, did a brilliant job and his choice to tell the story from Jessex's POV is, in the end, the perfect choice."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"It was a struggle to finish this book. It has positive features; the system of magic is well-conceived and well-described, and Grimsley has obviously put a lot of thought and effort into creating a history for his world. But this book simply doesn't make you stay up all night to finish it, the way the best novels do, although it does pick up a bit in the final third. I agree with the reviewer below who said that Jessex is perfect and therefore uninteresting. Also, I found the central relationship between Jessex and Kirith Kirin to be uninvolving, mostly because Kirith Kirin is devoid of personality. All we know about him is that he's a leader and that he's in love with Jessex, and we learn nothing more about him through 456 pages. Grimsley didn't make me believe that Kirith Kirin was thousands of years old, nor did he make me believe Jessex was 15. They could both just as easily have been in their 30s, judging by the dialogue between them. This is an interesting novel if you're looking for something different, but don't expect the readability of George R.R. Martin, Tad Williams or Robin Hobb."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I quite like this book. It is not extraordinarily good, but in comparison to many fantasy books I've lately been reading, it definitely is not bad at all.I agree with some of the reviewers who think Jessex is somewhat improbable because he seems much older than he really is and above all more mature than his lover and king, Kirith Kirin.In truth I must say it is all Kirith Kirin's fault, who is not much of a character: he is a bit too insignificant and colourless to be realistic if you consider that he is the immortal and millenary king who is ruling Athryn since thousands of years.Even the love affair between them is quite odd since you have the absurd sensation that it is Jessex who always takes all the initiative, which is at best unlikely if you think that he is fifteen years old --and virgin--, whereas his partner is much more experienced (I suppose he has been having some sex along thousands of years!).The magic is quite interesting and much better built than in Goodkind's or Marston's or Constantine's books (or even Flewelling's -who stands among my favorite authors-), the magic towers are a good and well developed idea.I liked it.It is worthy of the expense and of your time."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I can't even begin to put into words how much this story meant to me, and on how many levels. It's a rare book that makes you feel like you've been on a journey by the time you finally put it down; this is one of those novels I'll be thinking about for years to come. A magnificent work. Buy it."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Jim Grimsley is without a doubt my favorite contemporary author, and as a fan of gay fiction, and of fantasy, I was excited to hear that he had combined the two and produced \\"Kirith Kirin\\". While the book has many elements of a great fantasy, I didn't completely buy the romance and passion between the two main characters. For another author I would have applauded, but after reading Grimsley books like \\"Dream Boy\\" and \\"Winter Birds\\", I was expecting the same flesh and blood perfection in these characters, but it wasn't there. Perhaps the genre was a challenge because it seems Grimsley's greatest strength lies in his contemporary voice.Grimsley's depiction of magic and lore is meticulous and consistent, but unlike the grand-daddy of all fantasy epics \\"Lord of the Rings\\", this book drags at times, as we wait for a new revelation or battle. I wonder if the book would have been more enjoyable had a bit more been edited to make it a swifter read.All in all, still a good read for Grimsley fans, and I applaud any writer who refuses to be boxed into a particular genre."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Grimsley does an amazing job with this book. The characters are well developed and take you on an amazing journey. This book did remind me of the Last Herald-Mage Trilogy which it is bound to be compared too.Jessex is an adolescent on the verge of manhood when the winds of destiny catch him up into a struggle that has been blowing across the land. It is a journey of discovery and love that fuels the progress of this story.Unlike similar books in the genre, the magic system is well developed and we are allowed to glimpse the training that Jessex undergoes as he advances from level to level.This is a must read."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I don't know what it is about this book.... I had heard about it from a friend and looked it up here on amazon, it had enough good reviews for me and I decided to get it. I was very disapointed, the story line was good and the characters could ahve been interesting and fun, but there is just something about this book that made it VERY dificult for me to get through and even harder to really like. I felt no connection to the characters, and the romance between Jessex and Kirith Kirin was just.... it didnt seem real to me. I truely don't know what to say about this book. It wasnt my favorite but I cant say it is the worst book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"An avid reader of SF and Fantasy, I put this book as a reminder on my Amazon wish list about 10y ago. I refrained from buying it, largely because the \\"most helpful customer review\\" (Ivy, April 15, 2001) mentioned it was \\"too close to pederasty\\" (though in the end rating it 4 stars). I did not want to associate with pederasty. So I did not buy it. And so it went out of print. A few days ago I found the author'sDream Boyin a bookstore, and read it. A novel that pulled the rug from under me. Wow. I checked the author on wikipedia and found \\"Kirith Kirin\\" again, for Kindle. Read it in two days. Also wow. A fully fledged high fantasy world. Reminded me a bit of Gene Wolfe'sWizard Knight, and of Carol Berg's Rai KirahRai Kirahbooks. The second for the depth of the fantasy world, the first for the weirdness and the language, and because it moved me similarly. Some here liked it toWraeththu- well, that is gothic punk that does not compare. (Not all books with m/m relations in it compare. But Wraeththu's protagonist also happens to be 15 when he falls in love with a basically immortal creature. Nobody seems to have minded that.) So I say thank you for a wonderful, strange journey. I just ordered the author's two loose follow up novels (The Ordinary,The Last Green Tree). (And if you are still dubious because of that bloody p-word, let me remind you of the 12y age difference between Frodo and Sam.)"},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Kirith Kirin is one of the best Gay Fantasy books I have read. It is a hero's journey, in the High Fantasy tradition. It is the story of Jessex, our narrator, and his part in the war between Drudaen Keerfax, Athryn Ardfalla and Kirith Kirin.Jessex is descended from a long line of witches, and born into a country on the verge of civil war. The ruling Queen, Athryn Ardfalla, has too long resisted turning the throne over to its rightful successor (Kirith Kirin), using the powerful magic of the wizard Drudaen Keerfax to keep her eternally young, and taxing the kingdom's inhabitants into poverty and starvation in order to appease her own greed. As the kingdom grows increasingly restless, Jessex is recruited into Kirith Kirin's army, after the seer Mordwen Illythin is sent a dream foretelling Jessex' arrival.After Jessex leaves the farm he was raised in, his family is slaughtered by Athryn, his mother kidnapped by Drudaen, and his own secret training in the magical art of Wyyvisar begins. From here, Jessex' journey is long, and at times slow. But as he grows stronger, he will also discover true friendship with his comrades, find love in the midst of war, and recognize his own responsibility and courage despite fear and the slim odds of success.Although the story was slow at a couple of points, I absolutely loved reading Kirith Kirin. I became completely wrapped up in the character of Jessex and his journey through war. Although the book is \\"good vs. evil,\\" many of the characters develop a depth which is far more complicated.The book is moving and engrossing, and easily ranks as one of the best Gay Fantasy novels I have read. I look forward to reading more by Jim Grimsley.Read it!"},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"In Kirith Kirin, Grimsley begins his three-book series set in the world of Aeryn, where magic works in a fairly 'scientific' way. The world itself, and its places, take up a lot of the book, so that it seemed to take a long time to read it. But having read the other two books in the series, \\"The Ordinary\\" and \\"The Last Green Tree\\", I'm very glad to understand where this world started, and to meet Kirith Kirin and Jessex, who figures largely in the other two books. This series should be as well-known as many other modern fantasy series. The gay relationships were quite romantic, and there were no graphic sexual scenes.It's distressing that this book is out of print and not available cheaply used; I was driven to the library, when I would prefer to have my own copy."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Jessex is a normal boy who grew up as all little boys do, but he soon was called upon to enter the service of the exiled king. There he fulfilled prophecy after prophecy and was trained to be a wizard or Thaanarc. When his training is complete, he is immediately thrust into battle against an evil wizard who has ruled the kingdom for far too many lifetimes. At his side are the king, Kirith Kirin, and the other twice-named. The twice-named can be killed, but if they are not killed in battle, poisoned, etc., then they live forever. This is the story of their battle to regain the kingdom of Arthyn for Kirith Kirin.Jim Grimsley does a superb job on crafting a completely different world. He creates a richly textured land complete with details as to how magic works, how different races came to be and how the land is ruled. The details really make this world come alive and helps the reader understand all of the subtle ramifications that come from one small act.This book is written as a type of personal history that Jessex wrote long after all of this happened and, as such, is written in third person instead of the more active first person. This is a bit disorienting at first, but the reader soon adjusts and is captivated all the same.Take a chance on this novel - you will come to love the world and the characters. Hopefully Jim Grimsley will be inspired to write more fantasy novels that seem as real as this one."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I had read \\"Winter Birds\\" and \\"Dream Boy\\" by Jim Grimsley, so I knew he was a great author.

It has great character developement, and the characters also show true emotion.

Finally a majical hero that doesn't go through the book crying \\"why me\\" and \\"I really don't want this power\\". There are so many other works in the genre that drive me crazy for just these reasons. I know ... yet another all powerful majician saving the world, but that's the nature of most fantasy novels. The hero almost always has special powers. ... I enjoyed the book. It was a little long and could have been edited ... but at least it was well written. The love scenes didn't overpower and take away from the main story line. It was sort of like old movies where there's a little gropping, a little sex, the light fades, and the next thing you know, it's morning and the birds are singing. Somethings are better imagined. ....it wasn't yet another good vs evil scenario... It's all about power. People in power do not tend to relinquish it voluntarily. I remember a line from one of David Eddings books where two old sorcerers are talking to a young man. They tell him not to confuse the issue with good and evil. It's them and us and that sort of keeps it simple."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I have read this book over three times now and I never get tired of it.

Amazon didn't have any copies and the independent sellers where listing it for around 75 dollars! Eventually, I found a cheaper copy and purchased it.The writing for the story feels like a fable, gentle and mystical. For me, the style was different and enjoyable. The main character starts of like a mirror (in which he seems to have little personality and is there for other characters to bounce off of) but as he gets older he becomes more 3-dimensional.There are a few too many characters that tended to blend together as well as parts I ended up skimming no matter how hard I tried to resist, but overall I really enjoyed the story. There is a really nice romance story going on, while an interesting plot takes center stage.[...]"},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Kirith Kirin is the most original and creative piece of high fantasy I've ever read, and that's saying a lot since many of my books are fantasy and fiction oriented. The writing is, to put it simply, just amazing. The lines are well-wrought and masterfully executed, which serves to bring the large vivid world to life. What was most refreshing about this novel was that it was very original with how it handled magic, and it's almost guaranteed that you won't find this type anywhere else. There was no themes or motifs commonly found in fantasy books such as dungeons, elves, dwarves, dragons, etc., but it takes concepts so often overused and turns into something excitingly new. I'll admit, though, that Grimsley does get lengthy in the geographical and historical concept of the book. The book is slow paced, but rather than hinder the reader, I think it brings out the full depth of it (unless you happen to be impatient). Despite the lengthy descriptions that could've been cut down, the writing flows very well and matches the tone of the story. I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and is trying to find something new, as long as you don't mind the homosexual theme. It holds only a small piece of the book, but some would find their relationship to be rather scandalous due to the age difference."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"The first 70% is a great read, but after the turning point of the story line: the war of the wizards, both the plot and the characters get thinner and flatter, as if the author tried to finished it in a hurry..."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I must say I approached this one with both curiousity and trepidation; I've read most of Jim Grimsley's novels - Winter Birds, Comfort and Joy, Dream Boy - and found them well-written, engrossing, unusual, even masterful. But Kirith Kirin is a huge departure for Grimsley, who has crossed a line most authors won't: from 'literary' fiction to genre fiction, in this case fantasy. I wondered, starting the book, if he'd pull it off. Verdict? He stumbles in places, and Kirith Kirin is not up to the level of his other novels, but there's some good stuff in there. In short - it reads like a lot of the better first novels do, and as long as you can read it without dwelling on either its flaws or the fact that it *isn't* a first novel, it's quite enjoyable.But let's go back to those flaws for a second. First on that list for me was the main romantic relationship in the book, between Jessex, the farmboy-turned-magician-turned-savior-of-the-world, and Kirith Kirin, the virtually immortal king. Jessex is *15* for most of the book. For me, the disparity in ages - thousands of years old v. 15 - was too great. Sure, Jessex was willing, but the relationship seemed to me to be coming too close to pederasty. And the rationalizations offered by Jessex, as the narrator, weren't really enough to make me comfortable. (I also found myself wondering why Kirith Kirin, who has lived for millenia, couldn't find the wisdom and self-control to keep his hands off Jessex long enough for him to start shaving.)Another problem with the book is the length. It's 500 dense, closely printed, oversized pages. Now, I've read some great books of that length, books that needed and deserved to be that long, but Kirith Kirin isn't one of them. It begs for some judicious editing. In places, the excess verbiage drags the pace of the book down considerably - in particular, it seemed to me there were areas where Grimsley could've omitted his detailed descriptions - with things like travel itineraries, for example, and the many ordinary days the characters spend on horseback.However, the book has some great strengths, too. Despite a rather standard-issue plot (one that shows Grimsley's familiarity with fantasy literature, I might add), there is some true inventiveness in Kirith Kirin. In particular, the magic system and magic use stood out as an order of magnitude above what most fantasy books have to offer; for once in my life, I read an entire book in the genre without hearing any echoes of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons magic system.Also, Grimsley displays his usual command of the language despite the padding effect. Even the excess prose is a pleasure to read, especially in a genre like fantasy, where the writing isn't always of a high order. He also takes the opportunity to do some additional explorations of his usual themes - isolation, for example - and images.Overall, there's a lot more of Grimsley in this book than I had feared, and a lot less of the derivative stuff that fills a lot of fantasy novels. Although it did seem to me that the author hadn't quite settled into the genre, the book is very readable, and I expect that if Grimsley continues with the fantasy experiment, we should be seeing marvelous stuff in a book or two. So, in the final analysis: if you can give the author a bit of slack, you'll find a book that lives up to the genre, and in places goes beyond it."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"When I first picked up this book, I expected it to be light, brainless reading. Certainly, the blurb on the back cover gives no insight as to the depth and emotion of the story. More than a conflict of immortal royals and their wizards, it is the story of a rise to power and a loss of innocence, the devastation of war and the end of an era.The book is written in a first person narrative which allows the reader to experience the emotions of the main character as he develops his magical powers and discovers love in the form of his king, Kirith Kirin. Jessex's magical training is described in minute detail which caused the book to drag at times. On the other hand, the description of the circles of magic also led to an appreciation of the scope of Grimsley's imagination and attention to detail.The love affair between Jessex and Kirith Kirin was poignant and touching. Although at first glance, their romance appears to border on pedophilia, it is clear to see that Jessex had reached adulthood not only by Aeryn's conventions but in maturity as well. Grimsley manages to describe their growing affection with dignity and without resorting to the type of melodrama prevalent in many other fantasy books.Lastly there is the war itself and the conflict between Jessex and his enemy Wizard. The battles are described almost as an understatement. This only serves to make the destruction and the horror Jessex feels about this destruction more immediate.I could go on forever writing praises of this book! But I think the best way to truly appreciate this book is to read it yourself and immerse yourself into the characters. With Grimsley's powerful writing, Jessex and his friends come to life and it is not so difficult to imagine world such as the one they live in. Grimsley is a master storyteller with an amazing sense of imagination. I hope that he will write more fantasy books in the future of this caliber."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I want to start by saying that I've read just about everything Jim Grimsley has thus far written, so when I learned he was writing a strictly &quot;genrefied&quot; fantasy book, I was a bit curious (not to say skeptical). Like Grimsley (in his authorial comments above), I grew up reading Sci-Fi/Fantasy but more or less abandoned it for more &quot;classic&quot; (read: literary) fiction. This isn't to say I am denigrating genre fiction, as Jim has proved to me (via Kirith Kirin) that you can go home again.Kirith Kirin is vintage Grimsley with a twist, and I hear echoes of his other works coursing through this novel. It's ostensibly the coming-of-age story of Jessex, a 14-year-old farmboy who is prophetically called to become the saviour of the mystical world of Aeryn Along the way, Jessex discovers he is especially adept at magic, of which he is taught by three ancient &quot;sisters&quot; known as the Diamysaar. He also discovers that he loves, and is loved in return by, the soon to be prophetically-decreed king, the eponymous Kirith Kirin. Typical of the genre, there are inevitable conflicts involving battling magicians, armies of quasi-humans (called Verm) engaging the forces of Kirith Kirin, and the like. Through it all, Grimsley's prose shines beautifully. There is as much imagistic influence from Dream Boy and Comfort and Joy (particularly the emphasis in Kirith Kirin on singing) as there is from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Samuel Delaney.Having said this, there are of course caveats. Kirith Kirin is quite long (472 pages, plus glossaries and appendices) and sometimes tedious. The echt pedophiliac relationship between Jessex and Kirith Kirin (of which David Tedhams, in his June 2000 Lambda Book Report review, voiced concern) is utterly superfluous. Ironically Grimsley, perhaps showing his own Southern propriety, even apologizes (through Jessex) for &quot;too much information&quot; after their first erotic encounter.This isn't Grimsley's first foray into sci-fi/fantasy (his short story in Nicola Griffith's anthology Bending the Landscape and his play Math and Aftermath are the most obvious predecessors) but it certainly is his longest and, perhaps, most ambitious. I'm a great fan of Jim's writing and would eagerly recommend any of his books, including Kirith Kirin. I would also be interested to see if he continues in this genre. Well done, Jim!"},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I had no intention of liking this book. The cover is the worst sort of generic- dark horse riding through the woods-and the back cover blubage does little to convine anyone that there is anything interesting here. So why did I read it? Word of mouth from folks who never lie kept saying &quot;you've got to read this&quot;. The plot is summarised in other postings so I won't repeat any of that. It's the writing itself I want to tell you about-if you are wondering should you pick it up-the answer is: only if you want something exquisite. I said to myself as I read it &quot;I am not worthy. I haven't died and gone to reader's heaven with good lighting, huge cushy armchairs, and belgian chocololate yet. But here is an insider's view of magic and subtle states of trance, the regrets of living as an immortal, all the nuances of perception as an adolescent is trained as a magician. Move over T.H White!&quot;The word I want first to describe the writing is intelligent. By that I mean that as a reader I was never condescended to: I wasn't hit over the head with clunky expository lame dialogue. What a relief! Charachters that were fully imagined, not a stick figure sketched in anywhere. And no simplistic good wizard / bad wizard junk cluttering up the pages either.This is writing that far exceeds what might be reasonably expected. It's a great novel that happens to have magicians in it. Brilliant, tender, insightful, filled with life. Damn I didn't want this book to end.Read it and be seduced, dazzled, and end up buying copies for everyone you know. I was. I did. And I'm glad."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"If only action packed sword and sorcery fantasy novels are to your taste you should carefully avoid the trouble to look for this out of print book which I happened to purchase for a rather outrageous price.It is extremely slow paced, with longish descriptions of magic theory and magical duels and little action. We find here the coming of age story of young Jessex (the real main character), an anonimous adolescent peasant boy drawn into a civil war he hardly understands by a dim premonition of a long lived priest.As it is always the case in any fantasy novel, Jessex turns out to be far more important than everybody expects.He falls in love with his liege, gorgeous and long lived prince Kirith Kirin, learns magic and finally save his beloved, his kingdom and prevents an apocalypse.Sensitive readers should not get alarmed: sex is mentioned but never graphically; Jessex is very young but his love for the centuries old prince is authentic and mature, a little more than it is to be believed of a teenager.Mr Grimsley seems to be interested in creating a strange, melancholic, sensuos atmosphere; a world full of wrecked ghost cities populated by evanescent wraiths. The characters seem to partake in this misty setting, they seem to live a half life made much more by different shades of gray than by crude black and white. Even the main villain, though despicable, is only half alive. Much attention is given to the landscape instead: we get many (perhaps even too many) details and the land of Arthen seems to be the only character really alive.The writing being fine I only feel like complaining about the overabundance of invented words: it looks like an alltoo easy device to create an exotic setting; we are given a full glossary at the end of the book, together with some appendices regarding various aspects of this fictitious world, but why hinder the reader with strange sounding names when a well chosen common word could have served just as well is something I have not come to explain.At any rate this novel is beautiful and should not be out of print."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Could you tell that I liked the book from the title?Okay, so, just to let you know. I'm a straight female. For those people out there who think that you can't read something with gay guys in it because you're not one, you need to get over yourself and read this.The language was elegant, beautiful, and, just so you know, the sex wasn't over powering. I've read romance novels that were so much worse, you'd laugh.I must admit, that the age difference threw me at first. You see, from the reviews I read here before I bought the book, I thought that Kirith Kirin was some crusty old man, which he isn't. True, Jessex is only fifteen, but the way I was thinking about it was, Kirith Kirin only looked like he was 20, 25 maybe. My dad was 12 years older than my mom, so, looking at it that way, it didn't sound so bad. That's just a comfort thing for myself, though, if it will help more people read the book, great.The magical system was awesome. I loved the discriptions some other reviewers said were too long, and I thought that, even though Kirith Kirin might have been a bit more interactive and discribed, over all, the book was magnificent.This is most definitely a book that I will compare others to for a very long time, if not for the rest of my reading life."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"For a start, let me say this book is very well written. Like Dream Boy, the prose is well constructed, and has a similar dreamlike quality at times. The story itself is slightly different to the standard fantasy fare, notably with the interest in dualism, which at times seems to border on obsession. It has a bittersweet, elegaic quality to it, reminding me of the same sort of atmosphere that is so prevalent in The Lord of the Rings, which marked that book out from its many clones that followed. Also interesting is the portrayal of the relationship between Jessex and Kirith Kirin. It is not even described as 'gay' as such. It is simply a relationship based on love, the gender of the 2 is shown to be irrelevant.As for flaws... the characters are a little sketchily drawn, but this seems to be a feature of Grimsley's writing. He provides the framework, and we fill in the details. The magic system was well described but seemed self-indulgent: the depth of description made me glaze over on occasion, and did not seem strictly necessary. As for the supposed 'pedophilia', I would direct the reader to the contents page, which states that the year of Aeryn is substantially longer than our own, making Jessex at least 18 in our terms at the time he first slept with Kirith Kirin.Overall, an original fantasy well worth giving your time to. Will reward with ideas that people like Terry Goodkind can only wish they could write about."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Kirith Kirin is a huge departure into a world that grasps you right away. The two main characters, Jessex and Kirith Kirin, have a very slow-paced, fully realized and emotional relationship throughout the entire book. Yet the book doesn't shy away from plot nor the satisfying quality in the main love story. Both are large in scope and are simply mind-blowing; the scale in which you will imagine things while reading this book is unable to be put into words.There are dozens of side characters that enrich the lives and events in Kirith Kirin, but they never seem ridiculous or cliche. This book does not have the olden sound of J.R. Tolkien either, though the cover alludes to that sort of thing. Instead, it is a melancholic adventure of young Jessex, who you will see lose his innocence willingly in order to protect his King, Kirith Kirin. Instead, images of Miyazaki films or Steampunk (minus the technology) darkness come to mind.You could say that the main themes throughout this book are sacrifice, loyalty, and endearing through the near impossible. (However the ending, which I won't ruin for you, is questionable- but it leaves it open ended and ties up things you didn't even know you wanted tied up!)As for both characters, they are highly developed and a delight to read. In the beginning of the book, there are beautiful snippets of a happy situation between the two- so you will be both satisfied in the light department and the darker parts of the story as well. I am quite picky with character types, but I loved both of them. Kirith Kirin is almost like a figure of victory, a handsome young man that happens to be a blend of human and legend; but on the other hand, he's somewhat selfish (when it comes to Jessex) and brash, (in a cute, emotional sort of way)and it's a wonderful foil to his own image. He has an aura of command about him which makes him desirable, but when alone with Jessex, he has a tenderness that balances fear and duty. Jessex is someone who, even though he is telling the story in first-person, (which is done beautifully and doesn't ruin the story) you still ache to understand him, and you feel for him when he gives up certain mortal-virtues in his quest to aid Kirith Kirin. He has unquestionable trust in Kirith Kirin, and though he ends up having otherworldly magic, he is still so small a person.I've heard people have different thoughts of the \\"age\\" difference between Kirith Kirin and Jessex. However once you read certain parts, age is simply irrelevant. I mean, scientifically irrelevant. But, again, I won't ruin it.And if you want action- along with all these other things- buy the book. It was completley worth my forty dollars. The scope of the magic system is enthralling; they occur in huge green fields with masterful \\"wizard towers\\" looming over the landscape- storms are brought up by magicians and the sheer force of two mages battling each other atop these towers is awe-inspiring. They ride horseback and control devastating power, and you'll never want to stop reading!Overall, it's definitely in my top three. Maybe even number one. The length of the book is monstrous; the text is small and the 600 some-odd pages are satisfying and wonderfully done. The in-depth gay relationship thrives in the whole book; the two exist for the other and it is a beautiful asset to the plot. The adventure and battle system is unbelievable and huge in scope. The style of writing is highly advanced, almost poetic, and has an intricate quality only few can ever achieve. I would have easily smacked down more money than I paid."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"You get tired of the same old romantic-adventures where the hero save the maiden and good prevails over evil. I read Jim Grimsley's DREAM BOY on recommendation from a friend in my theatre. I really enjoyed it, not so much because of the story but because of the style in which it was told. KIRITH KIRIN, much like DREAM BOY, gives you a sense of knowing the characters and growing with them. Though a little slow in the begining, once the story really got rolling I couldn't put it down. The world Grimsley has created is a complex in its peoples and history as Tolkien's Middle Earth. What I really enjoyed about this book, however, is the conflict between people; each character has the potential for good or evil, giving them each their own spirit and the ability to surprise you.The big battle near the end is not the preditcable climax of any other book that gives you a sense of closure. Rather, it makes you want to keep reading and wondering how the characters will continue the rest of their lives, and you miss them when the book is done. I wish there were a sequel, or a prequel, or something with the same characters.All in all, this is a great book for fantasy lovers of any persuasion, male or (as in my case) female."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Grimsley is one of my favorite authors. Kirith Kirin is his first effort in fantasy and he has once again proven his talents. Kirith Kirin surpasses my expectation.

I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I knew about this ahead of time. I still would have read the book but I think a warning on the back cover or the excerpt in the front would be appropriate. I think the basis of the world and magic system was well through out as well as the religion in the fantasy world.

He learns magic, and discovers he is really talented but then he falls in love with Kirith Kirin and oh by the way who is a man! I stopped reading this book right after their love scene at 1/4 of the book. This is not a book for me or anybody else who has similar disinterests."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"A spell binding book. One can not stop reading. Sometimes you start believing, that magic could be real. I felt with Jessex and Kirith Kirin throughout the hole book.

After reading Grimsley's haunting and beautiful novel &quot;Dream Boy,&quot; I was intrigued to see how the writer would handle a fantasy genre piece. Grimsley really delivers...a tome filled with enchanting visions of a world where magic is revered, but little understood except by those who are very adept in the art. Don't let the hundreds of pages of very fine print scare you...Excellent map, glossary, and other appendices make the world portrayed come to life."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"I give the book two stars instead of one only because the prose style itself is not bad. Everything else about the book is. I have to admit I skimmed the first two thirds of the book - don't the authors know that the first rule of romance is to get your characters together? Apparently not. The first half of the book is about absolutely nothing much, and Kirith Kirin spends most of his time travelling somewhere far away. When he and Jessex finally get together, there is maybe two paragraphs of substance, which is everything worth reading about the book. Unfortunately it's only downhill from there. Kirith Kirin has zero personality, nothing, nada. He's a king and very old and in love with Jessex and that's it. Jessex is a boy - you get that from the beginning, and over and over again, and that's about all that can be said for him. He's a beautiful boy, he has magical powers, blah blah blah. There's a war in there somewhere, although I can't imagine anyone caring much about the battles or the outcomes, the politics of which are described in often excruciating (and yet completely uninteresting) detail. There is nothing personal in this book. It's a few character sketches and a detailed plot outline, and it just has no substance to it. The stuff you care about - what Kirith Kirin is thinking maybe, or what kind of person he is, or how these characters would interact with each other if ever anyone interacted with anyone in this book in all but the most superficial manner - all that stuff is missing. It also fails as a fantasy novel - the use of magic is highly unoriginal, warring parties devoid of character and motivation, and the plot is there but it just doesn't *move*. I put it down at about the two thirds point. It was just too painful to go on."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"Hey, can authors rewrite their own books? Of course they can! I think Jim Grimsley needs to redo this one. Kirith Kirin is actually kind of a prequel to his new science fiction books, The Ordinary and The Last Green Tree.His writing in the two new books is crisp, elegant, and has wonderful descriptions. Some of this is present in Kirith Kirin, also, but the plot is just...plodding. Very strange, with periods of extreme drama, interspersed with long, slow interludes...I really enjoyed the rich descriptions of the land and people in the beginning of the book, but I was VERY distracted by Mr. Grimsley's use of an invented language, later on. Every other word was in this faux-language, and I could not keep the names and terms straight.Yes, there are several appendices at the end--but when i read, I prefer not to break the narrative stream every other page by referring to them.The curious thing about Kirith Kirin is that it is mentioned--as a book!--in the Ordinary. One of the characters is reading it--and she can't understand it either!!Now that fantasy writers are freeing themselves from the Tolkienesque idea of many races, fake languages, and complex geography and linguistics, I think that Mr. G ought to write it again. amazon lists the publication date as 2000, but it seems much older.The new books move along much more briskly. His publishers can easily market the new \\"Kirith Kirin\\" as a \\"long lost prequel\\"."},{"Title":"Kirith Kirin","review":"One word: Mary Sue. Okay, so maybe two words. All I know is that Jessex (the main character, and narrator of the story) is portrayed as a frickin' savior to all the land. The world could literally have not survived without him. He has no faults. He has so many ethereal 'gifts' and 'magical abilities' that I want to puke. The 'rightful king', Kirith Kirin, is hopelessly woed by Jessex's beauty and youth and talent. Sure, the king is supposed to be a confident leader and more-than-able ruler. But he hangs to Jessex like a teenager with a crush. Yes, Jessex is 'special.' He is the 'chosen one.' Everyone must fear, admire, and worship him, AND the ground he walks on. When Jessex makes mistakes (I think there was ONE time), he saves lives and kills evil witches with superior magical abilities.Don't get me started on the magic. There were endless pages of thorough explanation on what the magic was, how to learn it, how to use it, and blah blah blah. I honestly couldn't care less about the tedious details of these special powers Jessex had to his disposal.But maybe you do. So read it, and if you hate it even a fraction of what I do, just don't say I didn't warn you. Personally, by the time I was finished reading the book (and it's a LONG book), I felt cheated. What a way to throw my time away. It's a pity, because I really did like some of this author's other works, especially 'Comfort and Joy.'

Jim Grimsley results indoing so are uneven. Great athmosphere, some beautiful evocative scenes (like Jessex in the abandoned city), but on too many places the reader feels like he's swimming in molasses.The general background isn't very clear,and one has to go to the appendix to see which is which.And the premise itself of the story isn't much plausible,on my opinion,even for a fantasy world. But what really annoyed me were the absurdly unsightly uneuphonious names the author chose for places and things: Shenesoeniis, Chalianthrothe, Gnemorra, Curaeth Curaesyn, to name some.

The Prince to be King will fall in love with him and they will have adventures. The plot moves slowly with attention to many details that are not obviously connected to the story line. Unlike Robert Jordan, however, Grimsley does not overdo the language and culture. Much there is here to link to history and culture. Also there aren't monsters and a brace of enemies. There is one Drugaen Keefax with whom Jessex struggles. One apparent thing missing with Drugaen is why he turned to shadow.

They are hard to put down once you pick it up. I am reading in chronological order, and am up to The First Fast Draw."},{"Title":"Heller with a Gun","review":"Why did Louis L'Amour have to shoehorn a schmaltzy romance into what could have been a lean, mean Western yarn? That infernal love triangle with King Mabry, Tom Healy and Janice Ryan just ground to a halt the momentum of the story and soured the closing quarter of the book, where this long-simmering subplot began boiling over into the primary plot, that of King Mabry escorting a hapless theater troupe up through Wyoming into Montana in a brutal winter, their tracks dogged by a band of greedy gunmen as well as by roving bands of renegade Sioux Indians.A strength of the story is seeing a seasoned man of the west--King Mabry--saddled with a group of five city-folk from back East. Mabry originally wanted nothing to do with them, meeting them at the Hat Creek Station as he was moseying south and they northwest. But their naivete, Tom Healy's plucking a gold coin from a full pouch in full view of wide-eyed, greedy dry-gulchers, for example, troubled his conscience, knowing they would be easy prey for the hard-bitten men bred by a hard land to hard ways (to paraphrase my copy's cover blurb, pulled from the closing line of Chapter One). And not only Mabry's conscience was stirred--he had an eye for Janice Ryan, one of the singers in the troupe. That coupled with his learning that Andy Barker--a fugitive killer from the Plummer Gang--was hired to lead the two wagons over the wintry expanse, motivates Mabry to follow along and watch for trouble, which invariably arises.The troupe of tenderfoot thespians is led by Healy, who is also in love with Janice. Doc Guilford is a \\"charming old windbag,\\" writes L'Amour. A 17-year-old ingenue, Dodie, and an older woman, Maggie, who is stricken with pnuemonia, round out the cast. Each responds differently to the trials and tumults they encounter on the frontier, though Doc and Maggie are window-dressing and relegated to remaining one-dimensional. Dodie moves from the background to the foreground in a well-done work of character development on L'Amour's part, showing how the struggles of the West can tap into and tease out from people strengths and abilities they didn't suspect they possessed. Tom Healy is the book's best example of that. He's a changed man after his escape from the camp and long, cold trudge through the snowstorm following Mabry's tracks. As doubtful as it appeared early in the book, there's now a confidence Healy has mustered what it takes to make it in the West.An element I always enjoy in L'Amour novels is his opening chapters. Like the pre-credits sequences in the classic James Bond movies, they often have no real connection to the main plot, but set the stage and galvanize the reader for action. This novel features one of the best I've yet read, with Mabry suspecting he's being tracked by a killer that he can't see in the blinding snowstorm. His finding and preparing a shelter and then confirming his suspicions of a pursuer makes for compelling reading. Chapter One could stand alone as a short story.This is a relatively early novel of L'Amour's, first published in 1955. It caught the attention of Paramount Pictures and was adapted into the 1960 movieHeller in Pink Tights. As is often the case, the movie strays far from the source material. The ludicrous title change alone indicates this movie is less a Western and more a \\"romantic comedy with slices of Americana,\\" to quote Robert Weinberg in his invaluable book for L'Amour readers,The Louis L'Amour Companion. Weinberg adds that it's \\"a wonderful film,\\" but that \\"most of the L'Amour novel disappeared.\\" Top billing went to Anthony Quinn as Tom Healy and Sophia Loren as Angela Rossini (the Italianized Janice Ryan role), with Steve Forrest of later fame onThe Baron: The Complete SeriesandS.W.A.T. - The Complete First Seasonplaying the rechristened \\"Clint Mabry.\\"Was I the only reader perplexed to discover no character in the book is named Heller? I kept waiting for this person to show up (with a gun, of course). I looked in vain for the meaning of this term, wondering if it was Irish or theatrical slang. The best I turned up was a dictionary definition of a \\"heller\\" as \\"a reckless person,\\" a description that could be applied to many characters in the book, from those foolhardy enough to oppose Mabry to--in my conclusion--Mabry himself in the final chapter!"},{"Title":"Heller with a Gun","review":"A gunfighter with a reputation again is the hero in Louis L'Amour's yarn that plays out in the wilds of Montana in the dead of winter.

I have found no important topics missed out in this truly encyclopedic work. And like other good encyclopedias, it is hard to put down once you start looking things up because one topic leads to another - and so on.The book is well written and easy to read. At the same time it contains important details such as the musical tempos and modes that are characteristic of different types of Irish tunes - reels, jigs, hornpipes, etc. This is especially useful for those who actually want to learn to play Irish music as well as listen to it with greater understanding. (Most books claiming to explain Irish music actually miss out the musical details altogether and take the easy option of just rehashing the familiar historical stuff.) There are also many examples of tunes provided in conventional musical notation.Key biographies are included of important and influential musicans - past (e.g. Michael Coleman) and present (e.g. Jackie Daly) - including their major recordings. This would also be very handy for anyone wanting to build a worthwhile CD collection as well as looking out for live performances of exceptional artists.Details of all the main instruments used in Irish music are given, i.e. accordions, concertinas, fiddles, flutes, pipes and whistles.The editor and writer Fintan Vallely clearly knows his subject extremely well and he has chosen other true experts for their valuable contributions. (This contrasts with certain other books that claim to be written by experts who really don't know what they're talking about.)I have personally found this book essential reading and I am extremely grateful to Fintan Vallely for providing so much good quality information in one volume.(In case anyone should be thinking, \\"Is 'The Companion to Irish Traditional Music' in any way too expensive?\\", then the answer is simply this: this book provides so much it is actually very good value for money - you could easily waste a lot by buying several other books that don't give you anything like the information you need and that furthermore seriously mislead you about the subject.)If you want a genuinely complete guide to Irish traditional music then this is it.

The topics are arranged alphabetically, which makes it seem a bit like a dictionary. While this is not necessarily a bad thing (easy to find what you're looking for), I prefer the continuous reading style of some other books. The competition generally comes up short on both amount and depth of coverage though.

I imagine Vallely did not intend it to be the last word, but some reviewers have made more if it than need be, I think. depending on what topic one is seeking to learn of it is varyingly helpful, frustrating, or of little use. the bibilographies and discographies are interesting though. refer to it, yes, just don't make it your only source of reference material for Irish music."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"All we want is a cozy, comfortable, inviting home.

This book defines various cottage looks, all the while talking about how to use those colors, furnishings, fabrics, and so on to turn your home into a cottage getaway. An interesting approach. I want to escape when I go home, so I am using this book as one of my guides in creating that &quot;great escape&quot; look in the suburbs. What I love is that my husband is getting into it, too. He talks about going away to his &quot;cottage&quot; on the weekends. This book doesn't focus on kitsch or clutter (but it did help me organize the teapots I collect) but on creating a look that can make a home seem like a farmhouse or a log house or a nautical seashore cottage in simple, tasteful ways."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I picked up the book at a big bookstore before ordering from amazon. (Amazon's price was better.) What I wanted (and got) was an excellent decorating book but not a ditsy, cutesy book filled with projects. This is a kind of interior design primer that seems to cover the bases of such things as color and arranging accessories but with a yummy, cottage-style focus. There isn't another book like it, and I've been looking. Very helpful and also a wonderful book so flip through because the photos are gorgeous."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I have to say this is my favorite decorating book. I could spend hours looking at this book and always see something new. I love the photos and the ideas. If you like masculin-homedecor, very contemporary, or very, very formal this may not be for you. The ideas are very easy to apply to your own home and style. I have a new home and the ideas work. If you have an older home this book is even more perfect for you! With these ideas we can relax and have style! I would call it Cottage Chic! Some Shabby Chic too. Beautiful!!! I highly recommend this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I didn't know my decorating style had a name until I found this book. It's all about decorating in a different way and avoiding the dull sameness that we usually find in suburban homes. There is something freeing about cottage style. It's all about freshness and fun and ease and escape. We are using this book and another cottage book called Second Home to inspire and guide us as we decorate our home."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Cottage Style can mean so many different things and this book can help you to find your own cottage style.This book covers the different modes such as beach house, primitive country, Victorian gothic, English country rustic western and southwestern, romantic (like Rachel Ashwell's shabby chic), French country, farm fresh country cottage, and garden style.The book is generous with photos for inspiration (over 200 to be exact)- no doubt some re-purposed from the pages of Better Homes &amp; Gardens - but examples are all somewhat \\"country\\" in appearance with all the painted, stenciled, stamped and embellished windows, walls, and floors. And all cottages are not country. If you want a real beach house, coastal living theme or a real English or French country look, you may want to look elsewhere.But the be-all, end-all knowledge of all forms of cottage style decorating is not what the book promises to be. It's a good primer to introducing you to ALL of the cottage styles so that you can see what speaks to YOU and your tastes. Then you can research each particular style that you want to achieve.No matter what, the book is a helpful reference for trekking your cottage style giving you specific suggestions on color, fabric, and accessories. Then, the book gives you specific examples for different areas of your home: living room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and porch...there is even a nursery decorating idea page.Perhaps one of the most valuable sections of the book is the glossary of terms in the back. It may only be a two-page spread but it is smattered with terms essential for decorating today.There are only a few real how-to instructions for completing specific projects in this book, but who cares? There are tons of decorating tips and snippets for added touches in creating cottage style home d&eacute;cor. All in all, a great feel-good book, great for thumbing through and making notes with a cuppa joe in hand."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This book finally defined my decorating style - I didn't even know it had a name. The photos and the info help you figure out what appeals to you so you can make decorating decisions that produce your desired effect. We have been able to give our home that &quot;cozy-comfy-bed&amp;breakfast&quot; feel that is very relaxing. I look at this book whenever I'm stumped and always get a new idea. Get it today!"},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"As soon as I read the customer revivew that referred to this book as a &quot;chick flick&quot; book, I knew I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed, either. It shows styles ranging from serene and pared down to kitschy, but each of them is lovable and cottage-cozy. And that is what we want in our home. I design all kinds of rooms for clients, but when I get home I want to sink into overstuffed chairs and have my favorite things around me. I have a lot of clients, too, who want me to use cottage furnishings and fabrics to turn their homes into &quot;weekend cottages.&quot; As a designer, I appreciate the fact that the book doesn't promote cluttered decorating but offers sound design advice on mixing colors, fabric patterns, and arranging collections and furnishings. This is a happy, snug little book on a style that never seems to die."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I started to buy the book at the bookstore and put it down -- on several trips. But, it kept drawing me in. Finally, I ordered it, and I am enjoying it very much. I find myself going back to it repeatedly -- picking it up when I finally sit down with some decaf at the end of the day or when I'm looking for an idea for a particular room. There's a lot here -- and it's fun to read, too."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I started using the ideas in this book 3 months ago, and our home is beginning to feel like the country cottage we've always wanted. I like the pictures. And the writing is telling me how to make lots of big and small changes in every room. Thank you!!!"},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I was thrilled to read all the online reviews of this book, as it sounded like just the thing I was looking for. I perused a copy at a bookstore, and absolutely hated it! The style is not cottage at all, but country: flowered chintz everywhere, clutter, cutesy. If you're looking for the simplicity of cottage style, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I was hoping for more of a shabby chic design, but it was fun to browse thru and get some ideas."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This is a beautiful book ! It was & is so much fun to look at !"},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I had to laugh at an earlier review which said that no one decorates like this. I bought this booka after seeing it on my neighbor's coffee table. Not only does she decorate like this, but her sister's home on the east coast is actually featured in the book. The book is beautiful if you love homey cottage-style decorating. I think the reviewer who did not like this book was a guy, and, frankly, this book is not a guy thing. It's like a chick flick decorating book! Yummy."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I am an artist and craftsperson but I am not a writer, so all I can say is that I love this book. The book is loveable. I sat with it for an afternoon and enjoyed every room. Now I have Postit Notes sticking out everywhere with my own notes about how I want to use this or that idea. Once the kids are back in school, I plan to be cozying up our home in cottage style. I love it."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I finally decided to see this book for myself, because I wondered what all the good reviews were about. I see now. I want a home that's homey, comfortable, charming, relaxing, timeless, and simple, and this book has captured that. Like an earlier reviewer, I was surprised too that there was so much variety within cottage style. I like the big color pictures but also the idea that the author has explained decorating principles so I can not just copy the rooms I see but create my own look. The book is lovable, and I hope my rooms will be the same. My problem now is that I pick up the book and end up sitting back and just daydreaming with it instead of getting going on decorating. A pleasure to look at."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"poor book, I don't read it anymore."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Lush pictures of several cottage styles makes this a delightful book to peruse while sipping tea. The vaired cottage styles include the expected &quot;English Ambience&quot; and &quot;Touchable Treasures&quot; but also included &quot;Camp Out&quot;, &quot;Family Farm&quot;, and &quot;Pure and Simple&quot;. There are many cost conscious suggestions and funky whimsical designs which made this a book that I added to my own library. I got many ideas for adding the cottage flair to my home without breaking the bank. I truly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This is the first interior Design book that I actually purchased &amp; I thought it was well worth the price. It gave a broad overview of various &quot;cottage style&quot; interiors - everything from rustic cabin to English garden cottage to plain American farm house. I was able to get a much more focused idea of the look that I want to achieve. I'm taking this book with me while shopping for a few new furniture pieces in the next 12-18 months and I think it may have prevented a costly mistake."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"An absolutely great book, filled with tons of color photos that demonstrate cottage style in many different fashions. Whether you are interested in English country, nautical, romantic, folksy... or any other form of cottage decor, this book will have ideas for you! And the text is just as nice as the photos! No boring, four syllable, technical jargon... The content is easy and enjoyable to read and teaches you the basics of decorating for any style. So even if you discover that cottage isn't your thing, you can still benefit from this book by using the basic decorating elements and creating your own design. What a great book... Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This book is jam packed with gorgeous pictures and ideas. I never realized how many different expressions of Cottage Style there is. It helped me to fine tune the specific cottage style that was right for me. I personally was turned off by anything cutesy but found that cottage style needn't be cutesy at all...if you don't like that look. Nor does it have to look old and antiquey. Most books on decorating I read from the library. This one I had to own. It is a reference that I will use over and over as I 'tweak' my decor year after year."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This book, which I recently purchased, is beautiful to look at and wonderful to read. It's loaded with photos, ideas and decorating advice. The fact that all kinds of cottage styles are represented is important to me. I think one of the earlier reviewers who thought the book was busy was misled by the way the book is designed. As an art major, I did find that the graphic design IS busy. But for me that is a minor complaint."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I don't see the problem with the graphic design (which an earlier review mentioned). I love this book. I thought I was buying a pretty dream book to get me through the winter, but now I've put Post-it Notes on page after page so I don't forget all the ideas I'm getting. The first thing I'm going to do is paint the old brown paneling in our den, slipcover the couch, and put up some lace curtains. As I said, I just love this book."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Caringer's book is definitely not a &quot;buy a blue pillow and place it on the floral couch next to the white lamp&quot; type of book; rather, the photographs and one-line comments give you sensible ideas on how to achieve the look you desire on your own. Whether you want to buy everything new, incorporate your existing furniture into this look, or experiment with garage sale finds, this books shows you how to do it. Everything from floors to ceilings, bathrooms to porches, as well as how to use accent pieces is covered in this book. I would also recommend it for singles/couples just starting out as it illustrates how to put together ordinary items to create an extraordinary environment."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This is the ultimate springtime redecorating book. It'll get you out of your winter doldrums and deep into planning how to freshen up your rooms. This isn't a book, it's an anti-depressant! Fresh and happy and springy and cozy all at the same time and packed with one idea after another."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I just looked at this book at &quot;Urban Cottage&quot; (a wonderful store) in Buckhead/Atlanta, and could not wait to get to the internet to find out more about it. Like many of you...I have a small place and I want my home to be unique and peaceful, a place for entertaining and rest from the Atlanta pace...you encouraged me that this book will help me get there. Thanks...I can't wait to get started!"},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Now that the holidays are over and spring is around the corner, I'm so ready to redecorate and turn my house into the kind of getaway that the author describes.

Now, on amazon I found the follow-up book by the same Better Homes and Gardens editors. It's called Second Home, and it has more decorating ideas (from real second homes around the country) and also information on finding our own second home. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"The cover was the best photo found in the book. Many pictures showed busy rooms and cluttered kitchens. I love country chic style and am a HUGE fan of cath kidson and rachel ashwell as well as other books such as New Cottage Style and Country Chic. If you are looking for those styles, this is NOT the book. After looking through this book, i wanted to clean out my entire house due to the clutter overload."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Uh oh -- I loved Cottage Style so I guess that makes me cutesy, according to the previous reviewer. I wrote one of the positive reviews earlier, because the book encouraged me to make this little place of mine the cottage I'd always dreamed of. Yes, my sofa is chintz, my walls are white-painted paneling, and lace curtains flutter at my windows, blown by the breezes off the ocean. If that's cute, than what's the problem?"},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I just discovered this book after first buying a newer book by the same author and publisher. This book shows how to decorate any home in a way that makes it feel like a weekend house. I already have marked lots of pages that have ideas I plan to use. The newer book, called SECOND HOME: FINDING YOUR PLACE IN THE FUN goes one step further and shows real second homes around the country. SECOND HOME covers everything from choosing a second home location and home style to decorating. Both books are like little getaways or destinations in themselves, because I love sitting, relaxing, and looking at all the pictures. Both books also make me believe that I really can, first, turn my present home into a &quot;getaway&quot; and, second, actually find, buy, and decorate a real second home some time in the future."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Great pictures coupled with great decorating advice for everything from arranging collections (and furniture) to planning color schemes."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"This book is not bad, it has useful information, it has nice photos (some I've found a little dated).However it is still helpful if you want to create your own little cottage retreat and you can get some inspiration looking at the pictures too.I was still a little disappointed when I've received this book, probably I was expecting more up-to-date photos. I've seen better picture books out there on cottage style. I think this book is still growing on me...I got some use out of it though."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"I didn't know until I picked this book up at a book store that it's about decorating in a way that can give my home the look of a vacation home. What a neat idea. Amazon's price was better, so I ordered the book on line, and I'm loving it. I'm really happy with the photos and ideas."},{"Title":"Cottage Style","review":"Thank you, thank you, thank you. I've always been afraid that my favorite decorating style was too &quot;homey&quot; to be &quot;cool.&quot; Now I know I was wrong. This book has given me &quot;permission&quot; to decorate my way with country-cottage furnishings and my favorite accessories. We live in the suburbs, but when you walk in, you feel as if you're in a summer cottage."},{"Title":"Sadat","review":"Kissinger and Brezhnev worked in concert to release the tightening noose which caught the warring parties. Was that planned well in advance or was it by a sheer \`last minute' appraisal? How can one know! Brezhnev invited Kissinger to come immediately for talks. In fact, Brezhnev made a personal appeal and on Saturday, October 20, 1973, Kissinger flew to Moscow. To the layman in the Middle East that was a sudden activity and a total surprise. The closed-door conference started immediately, press reports said the two high officials met in less than two hours after Kissinger's air force plane had landed.Why the sudden appeal to come? Why the sudden wish to get something done quickly? Why the sudden excitement, or indeed: Panic? - We were surprised how far the Soviet leaders remained inactive for almost two weeks !! The short and obvious answer is of course that until about October 18 the Russians had thought that the Arabs were winning; if not a total and complete victory but, at least, the Arabs - in Russia's eye - were gaining the ascendancy with advancing edge as the war progressed day after day, so that at the end of fighting they would negotiate from a position of strength when an inevitable armistice talk started within a month or two from October 6.Actually, the Soviets were led to believe that, on the battlefield, the story was indeed so rosy. Their side was gaining ground. The Soviets were briefed the Israeli counter-attack into Syria , which was similar to a German WWII Blitzkrieg, had been halted and it was a viable conclusion that in the important battle for Sinai the Egyptians would grow more powerful and the Israeli weaker with each day that passed.Local (Arab) press focused, the previous Saturday of October 13, on the National Security Council meeting with the conclusion that the Russians had no interest in an immediate cease-fire. The media highlighted as a major premise that the Russians had no plans to stop arms supplies.Up to October 15, Soviet diplomacy was not entirely inactive but it behaved with leisurely steps. Nobody was in a hurry. On Tuesday of October 16, Kosygin - the Soviet prime minister- went to Cairo for two days meetings. Everyone he saw, Egyptians as well as Officials from the Russian Embassy, told him that military situation was excellent; Laymen in the rest of the Arab world were having mixed feelings about the military condition. A Yes and No stance - strange indeed! Like one wanted to believe Arab successes were true and resisted any news to the contrary even if this news was true. There were three meetings in Cairo between Kosygin and Sadat. The press did not tell us much about the outcome of the three meetings, until after we listened to BBC that Sir Alec Douglas Hume, the British foreign secretary, had been told, most probably by the Soviet ambassador in London, that the purpose of Kosygin's visit to Cairo was: \\"\\"Mission of Peace\\"\\". \\"\\"Mission of Peace?\\"\\" We began to speculate that most probably Egypt's peace terms were discussed. But was that good news or bad news? In these talks, according to a Yugoslav source, Kosygin suggested an Israeli withdrawal and minor Egyptian concessions on its borders with Israel; the new Lines were to be guaranteed and to be policed by the U.S and U.S.S.R. The Egyptians turned down these suggestions; they would not budge one inch, \\"\\"Egypt will not give up a single centimeter of Egyptian territory\\"\\" the Egyptian radio vowed.While Kosygin and Sadat were deliberating, Israeli Raiding Unit headed by General Ariel Sharon continued its activities west of the canal; later, according to General Saad-eddine Shazli, it took the Egyptian high command more than three days to realize the full extent and the implications of this operation.One cannot dismiss the fact that the Russians were better informed. A reappraisal of the military situation took place in Moscow only on the day of Kosygin's return, October 19. Within the context of the policy of \`d&eacute;tente' between USA and USSR, the Russians were made aware of the actual military predicament. On October 19, the day that sent shudder throughout the Arab countries, the Soviet press reported for the first time that Israeli units were operating on the west side of the canal. This news prompted Brezhnev to make his \`'sudden \\"' decision to appeal to Kissinger to go to Moscow on October 20."},{"Title":"Sadat","review":"In my view, the book &quot;Sadat&quot; by David Hirst shows the far sightedness and wisdom of Anwar Sadat in a way the author never intended. The book was first published in 1981. The author portrays the late Egyptian President as a somewhat weak man who threw himself at the Mercy of the West, secured a peace for Egypt at the expense of full resolution of the Mid east conflict. Through out the whole book, the claim is made that Sadat's peace mission was in reality a disservice to the Arabs and Jews, because it made an &quot;easy&quot; peace which overlooked solving the more intransigent issues of the conflict, such as the Palestinian refugees problem.Now, 20 years after the book was first published, the events show how erroneous the author was and how wise Sadat was. Sadat's peace saved Egypt other horrible wars, secured peace and some economic advance in those 20 years over its conditions during Nasser. It established for the rest of the Arabs a guideline for dealing with Israel some of which was used even by the Palestinians themselves through the Palestinian Authority negotiations in Oslo. Sadat broke the psychological barrier to negotiations between Jews and Arabs.I can't but wonder what would have happened to the Middle east had Sadat lived. Some of Sadat's ideas mentioned and criticized in the book, such as using the Niles waters to irrigate the Sinai desert and Israel Negev desert appear nothing short of genius.I really enjoyed reading this book. As I read it, I could not but feel the weakness of the arguments the authors presented against Sadat's mission. But the counter argument I need not make, because history has already made it for me. The book's prophesies , which history has proved a failure, is a great testimony to that Sadat was ahead of his times, even for an author as sophisticated as David Hirst."},{"Title":"Amazing Grace","review":"This book, which is a perfect gift a non-believer or believer, is a powerful, yet simple display of the various forms of God's immeasurable grace. I found this book a great source of encouragemt and a great lesson on the realms of God's grace. It really will open your eyes and help you to appreciate the sacrifice of Jesus."},{"Title":"Carthage","review":"Ross Leckie writes exciting, thrilling storys, but a writer should not work in historical fiction if he doesn't know anything about the period is writing. Every time ross goes for some detail...it's COMPLETELY WRONG...he dont even know that a primus pilus (primipilus) is the first centurion of the first cohort. If you want to read historical novels about rome, try Steven Saylor or the marvelous Colleen McCullough. Mr. Ross, You don't have to be a scholar to write historical fiction, but please...read one or two books before you write your novels."},{"Title":"Carthage","review":"This is actually the last book in a trilogy but the first of the trilogy that I have read. I very much enjoyed this novel. No, it's not pretty and there are no characters who are all good or all bad....pretty much like real-life. The previous novels have received VERY mixed reviews and I suspect this will be no different.This is not history romantacized so it gets pretty rough sometimes but it is a good story with seemingly excellent character depiction. Also, one must bear in mind, it is a historically based NOVEL....license is taken.If for nothing else....I was introduced to the wonder of the city of Carthage.I have since purchased the first two novels in this trilogy and am ready to proceed.....more so now that I have read the mixed reviews as I am now very curious to see what my eventual feelings are on these novels.In any case, I found this to be an intelligently written, thoughtful book and would recommend it. Take your time reading it...the more time you give this book the more you will get out of it."},{"Title":"Carthage","review":"I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong, this is trash, one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, he doesn't know squat, and his characters are ludicrous, badly written and boring."},{"Title":"Bulletproofing Your Medical Practice : Risk Management Techniques For Physicians That Work","review":"The focus of the book is on the &quot;administrative&quot; end of the medical risk management spectrum. A book like this is a must for a physician facing a first time medical malpractice claim.My only desire is for a more substantial treatment of physician practices that mitigate risk prior to a claim being made."},{"Title":"The Black Mountains (Ace book)","review":"A magnificent blend of fantasy, medieval, hints of technology, and magic, this is Saberhagen at his best. The Black Mountains is the second section in Empire of the East, (related to the Swords novels).The plot details an assault by freedom fighters on a mountain citadel, held by a dark lord who has become something less than human, and a great demon, whose mere passing weighs heavy on human minds and makes bones feel like jelly. Another great being of unknown allegiance uses his power to heal whatever men come to him. The plot is gripping and detailed, yet simple, and the stories of the characters are well-told, inspiring, and necessary to the whole. It features characters from The Broken Lands: Rolf, and Chup.I've read many fantasy and Sci-fi works, this, along with its sequel Changling Earth, just might be the best."},{"Title":"Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars : A Memoir","review":"Yep, this girl stood out at Harvard. She stood out on the East Coast. She'd have stood out anywhere, except perhaps for the gritty streets in Oregon and California where she was raised, essentially homeless. Lauralee Summer is protective of her mother in this memoir, and one quickly understands why. Certainly hampered by despair, depression, perhaps mental illness, and the stigma of welfare mom and Bag Lady, Lauralee's intelligent mother nevertheless home schooled her daughter, protected her, stayed with her, and loved her.Somehow Lauralee won a scholarship to Harvard - in wrestling.!?! Graduated now, surviving even the Parents' Weekend when Mom arrived from the shelter, she has written a memoir without self-pity, full of the shame, rage, and heartbreak of her growing up years on the streets and in shelters.It's not a perfect book, but it deserves 5 stars for talent, guts, storytelling, and a great forecast for the future."},{"Title":"Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars : A Memoir","review":"Seeing is believing, or in this case---reading, as the adage goes that relates to the remarkable story of one such lady who in my opinion beats Frank McCourt's 'Angela's Ashes.' Don't get me wrong about McCourt's memoir of the Irish poor, but Lauralee Summer's oddly titled 'Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars' has an extraordinary flair all it's own. When Lauralee Summer was at the age to enter college she never knew her life would make the newpapers and make radio airwaves nationwide. The headlines would read \\"Homeless to Harvard\\" and she even got interviews with the Boston Globe and other prestigious newspapers. When she was asked to make a network TV appearance, during the interview she was pressed for time, the host gave her only less than a minute to reply to the question: What was it like to be homeless? The short-moment media experience of her life in a nutshell prompted her to write the memoir.Summer's reveals in her memoir of a fatherless, nomadic-type life who lived with her mother who was known very little of being employed, eccentric---but loving and protective of her daughter. Summer and her mom were always on the move to one state or another. Life was far from easy of living in dreary, and even dangerous homeless shelters and delapidated welfare houses. They didn't own a car or a bank account and what little money they had wasn't enough for food or clothing. The sort of schooling Summer had she obtained here and there. And her joy came from learning to read and her love of books when she was a small child. It wasn't until she reached high school when she found the mentors she needed and a love for wrestling where she was accepted on the competitive all-male team! This was the time in life, Summer was able to move into her own acceptance. This would later build her foundation into the priviledged walls of Harvard. It was when Summer won a wrestling scholarship to Harvard, she was in the limelight of the press media of her unique story. Summer had come a long way from poverty and neglect, but everything paid off in the end. For everyone it always does in some way. Summer found her place in the world and made her own home. By constructing her life from the life of the streets and her Harvard education she is a mentor who paints a window of the dark, isolated and discriminating world of women and children in poverty. The house that Summer built was the one of a honest, courageous and compassionate heart who has found joy from dogs without collars."},{"Title":"Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars : A Memoir","review":"Lauralee Summer's memoir moved me beyond words. It is so uplifting to read stories like hers that show the resilience of the human spirit.Despite her very unconventional childhood, Lauralee's mother was very loving and supportive within her capacity to provide for her brilliant daughter.An earlier reviewer mentioned her father. This chapter moved me more than almost any other. If there was ever a person who regretted his earlier behavior and genuinely tried to make it up, then her father would get my vote.Inspiring, moving, beautifully written in the same vein as ANGELA'S ASHES and FINDING FISH"},{"Title":"Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars : A Memoir","review":"A woman and her infant daughter, chronically transient and homeless...the mother (an unsung champion) makes love, tenderness, knowledge and wisdom available to her child in small ways, whenever and however she can; one or two important people at critical moments, and the bright, irrepressible child grows up and goes to Harvard.There is a tender innocence throughout. A protective telling of the author's story. The love between the mother and the child...the anguish felt over their circumstances...never maudlin, always sweet...intimate sadness, a tender grief...an un-self-pitying resolve. I sensed all of these feelings and ideas on almost every page.And, finally, the child becomes a young woman, intelligent, strong and loving.I think of this as more than just another Horatio Alger story."},{"Title":"Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars : A Memoir","review":"Lauralee has a warm soul, a compassionate heart, and a gift with words. I feel truly thankful that she has chosen to share these stories.Once I started reading I could not stop. I kept reading as I walked through the city, oblivious to the traffic dodging and cursing me as I drifted through intersections.

Nothing too intense. It was a little slow in the middle, but still had enough interesting stories to keep the reader going and find out what happened to this young woman.

Doherty brings to life once more Hugh Corbett, accomplished clerk and spy of King Edward I of England. Doherty, who is an Oxford graduate and history scholar, is a popular author writing under other names as well and he is able to bring the 14th century literally to life in an intriguing series that weaves logic, realism, and romanticism with medieval European thoughts and actions. Indeed, Doherty really does lay bare some of the romantic concepts we're used to, in not only this book, but the others as well. Thus, it is Hugh Corbett's responsibility to save the King once more in this ninth accounting.The year is 1303 and Edward's nemesis, Philip IV of France, continues to threaten the very essence of Edward's kingship. This time, Edward arrives in York to begin a series of secret negotiations with the Knights Templar. Following an attempt on his life, the King sends for Corbett and his faithful servants Ranulf and Maltote (Ranulf has been promoted to &quot;assistant&quot; by now). From this point, the book picks up its always-suspenseful form and the reader is carried to a satisfying, intriguing end (what else?) in royal fashion.The title comes from the fact that the assassin in the book uses a mysterious fire to kill his victims. This fire seems &quot;unexplainable,&quot; but Corbett (whose skills in logic seem to leap centuries!) is able to &quot;break the code&quot; and solve the mystery, as one would expect.Doherty's flair for evoking the realistic images of the period is no accident, as he is an accomplished historian who specializes in Edward I. Doherty also writes under the noms de plume of Michael Clynnes, Anna Apostalou, C.L. Grace, Edward Marston, among others. Each &quot;name&quot; features a series with exciting historical characters--none to be missed. An exciting read!"},{"Title":"Satan's Fire (Hugh Corbett Mysteries 09)","review":"Hugh Corbett, bloodhound to King Edward I is back in business.

Hugh and his two companions find a very secretive and dangerous place where people keep dying in a mysterious type of fire that resists water. The best thing about the series is the history lesson that we get from each book. Not only do we hear about the Templar movement and some of its history, but we find out where and when gunpowder originated in this book alone.

P.C. Doherty weaves a fine tale within a tale."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"Two things induced me to read this book: 1) Its brevity, and 2) it's status of having won the prestigious Pen/Faulkner award. I dug the book out from one of my banana boxes and read it in one day. I was amply rewarded. Each page added to the intrigue, and I could hardly wait to see what would become of the characters. I wanted to learn the fate of Lewis, who Wolff characterized as one screwed-up dude. I actually felt sorry for him and wondered what experiences in his life could have produced such behavior. As for Philip, he is irrevocably changed by his experience at Fort Bragg and the Vietnam War. But, in my opinion, the ending came too abruptly. Wolff simply tells, in a few sentences, what becomes of the characters after the war. I think the novel would have been more powerful if Wolff would have shown a few scenes in the lives of each character. After I read the last sentence of the book, I wanted more, more than I got. Maybe an epilogue of sorts. But Wolff atoned for this deficiency by revisiting the symbol of the ammunition dump at the end. Life can be volatile and each experience (spark) in our lives can have explosive consequences."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"I've read and re-read (multiple times) everything Tobias Wolff has written and I think this book is the best. It has the narrative pacing of a suspense novel, with strange, funny yet very human characterizations. The writing is pristine clear. The primary theme is the percieved benefits of conformity by the main character and his undercurrent of resistence to it."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"Tobias Wolff has written a brief yet powerful tale concerning a young man awaiting deployment to Vietnam. During his wait at Fort Bragg, a thief emerges, stealing from his fellow troops. The tale goes on to offer reactions to the thefts, then, in true original Wolff style, switches perspective half way through to give insight into the motivations of the thief himself. Finally, the book finishes with its original perspective, offering a tight and satisfying conclusion.Wolff is an expert at cutting to the heart of his characters, sometimes with very little narrative at all, but his stories always resonate with the reader far after the book has been finished. The Barracks Thief is no exception, and I believe it is a superb commentary on how most of us feel alone even when surrounded by throngs of people.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"Tobias Wolff may be known for his skill in short fiction and memoir, but his lauded 1984 novella THE BARRACKS THIEF won the PEN/FAULKNER award. It's a beautiful example of how even longer fiction can take on the intensity of a much shorter story.THIEF centers on three young men who enlist in the Army during the Vietnam era: Philip, Hubbard, and Lewis. The chapters alternate between their viewpoints; Philip's parts are told in the first person except for the novel's opening chapter, while the other two are in the third person. Because none of them has been to Vietnam, each is isolated from the other, more experienced men, and simultaneously feels resentful toward the other two loners. One of the three soldiers is the culprit for the wallet thefts in the barracks, which comprises most of the story.This book is no classic whodunit, as the thief's identity is clear about halfway through the slim volume. The true story is not about crime, but about how each of these three vulnerable characters is vulnerable and seeking after love and comfort in a world that doesn't make itself hospitable to either. This yearning molds each of their lives in different ways. Philip comes from a broken home, his father distant, his brother missing somewhere out West. Hubbard is homesick and devastated from the deaths of two of his closest friends while he was away, and his only solace is in the love expressed in his mother's letters. Lewis is a hillbilly-ish braggadocio whose claims of sexual exploits are an attempt to cultivate acceptance and push away the insecurity that tears away at him inside.THE BARRACKS THIEF is a novel about brothers who aren't brothers, men who are desperate to join a lasting family, but are quick to forget those who perish and to denounce those who betray the group...even those who betray it for reasons that make them kin to everyone else.Favorite line: \\"The full moon lit up the silk above me, above the hundred other men falling in silence overhead and below and all around me. It seemed that every one of us fell under his own moon.\\""},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"A very short read, but full of emotion and great story.

I hope Mr. Wolff enjoy's his new teaching job at Stanford."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"This is a story about three guys who enlisted in the Army. One of them was the barrack thief. I could learn some interesting things about what kind of life these men lived in the Army."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"This book took Vietnam War to be the background to narrate the story of the barrack's life. The story is about three young paratroopers who are Philip, Hubbard and Lewis. They are from different families, and they have different characters. Everything seems so insignificant and common, but actually it is very natural and lifelike. This book shows perceptive clarity, I understood it."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"The Barracks Thief was a pretty good book, the plot seemed so real; it dealt with real life situations of a persons life.Wolff did a excellent job on making the reader feel the pain that the boys and the mother were going through after their father left the mother for another women. He touched basis on love, trust, survival and friendship.This wasn't Wolff best book but it was a good book he made his charecters like real people they did things that real people do; he kept the readers attention and that was good for me.In the beginning you would think that the book would be about a man who was having problems with his wife and wanted to leave;that wasn't the case at all Wolff really switched it up on you.Wolff talked about how one of the boys was having trouble in school and wanted to go to college but his grades were not good enough to go so he had to attend a junoir college.The book had a little of comedy,profanity and real life drama,the book touched basis on the everyday relationships of family members.The brothers were not that close in the story but the older brother was more closer to his friends then with his brother.In one chapter of the book the older brother even joined the army to better his life;there he met his two friends that turned out to be a big part of his life to me writing that friendship in the story was good because it showed how friend really stick togeather when times get rough.Wolff did an excellant job on this book i would reccommend this book to any college person that really big on reading long story books this is a great choose because it is short and very interesting.Wolff did a good job on giving full detail on the boys life while they were in the army,this was one of the reasons i thought the book was a good book because Wolff worte it in a true form meaning the things that the boys did or talked about were things that boys today do and say overall i give the book three stars."},{"Title":"The Barracks Thief","review":"It was interesting to me to know about the soldiers'experiences before going to war.

It all comes together to create one of the most remembered US Open's in history."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I'm not a huge fan of this book. I made my way thought it, but it was a bit of a slog. The book is more about the behind the scenes aspects of the Open than the actual Open itself or the professional golfers plying their skills and the competition itself. As such, you'd really have to have an interest in the minutia of event planning to enjoy this read."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The actual playing of golf tournament is secondary compared to getting the rights to host the Open, the long planning cycle and the behind-the-scenes action. That's ok with me, as play-by-play of golf action usually doesn't work well in print. In this case, the tournament did not have a lot of suspense or memorable golf moments, with Tiger largely in control.Thus, we learned about the massive effort to pull off a tournament, beyond what readers may have sensed had they volunteered at a regular PGA stop or even only attended one in person. Feinstein covers many inevitable turf wars and glitches and weather-induced problems against a firm deadline. You can't slip the schedule for the US Open. A core of talented and dedicated people succeeded in execution, which, although it must be quite difficult, is far from unique, as majors run each year and other sporting events of significance also manage to happen. It made me wonder what would happen if something really bad did occur (beyond weather and a parking mess) at a major. The author gives a lot of detail on the staff, with various amusing anecdotes or key background, but they blend together and ultimately are rather forgettable.The end result is an OK book, one unlikely to be read seven years after the fact (there's even been another Open back at Bethpage in 2009), other than as a snapshot in time and as a rather different look at golf."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Open is an exceptional book that takes the reader literally behind the ropes at Bethpage. Starting as a wild idea to host the Open on a public course, Feinstein is able to capture the years, months and days leading up to the 2002 Open. The book takes into account the extra security, parking, and such that comes with a major sporting event just months removed from 9/11. I enjoyed the in-depth profiles of the individuals responsible for putting on the show. The stores about close calls and how pairings are made. The book is definetly not your typical recount of a shot by shot golf tournament but rather a masterpiece for those of us that are as intrigued about how the USGA puts on championship versus who wins it. I recommend it to anyone who would is interested in the business side of sports especially golf."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Typical Feinstein (\\"A Season on the Brink\\" excepted). Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc. This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island. The subtitle, \\"Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black,\\" is used here as a figure of speech, meaning \\"behind the scenes.\\" (\\"Inside the ropes\\" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.) Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion. We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course. Yet the book does not fulfill its promise. My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Being from Long Island, I understand the story behind the US Open. I was also able to go to the Open on the Saturday and get a feel for the event. As such I really appreciated this book because it is hard to build such an event in the public course like Bethpage. It is a testament to the USGA on how organized they are and all of the event preplanning they do. I thought it was a different and insightful look at the Open"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Mr. Feinstein is a gifted writer and storyteller. This is the story of a golf course, the championship it hosted and the people that made it happen. Mr. Feinstein follows the story of the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black Public Golf Course from idea to fruitition. He takes us behind the scenes and inside the ropes. It is a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Having read &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; and &quot;The Majors&quot; I surmised that John Feinstein had exhausted his insights on the subject of golf. However, &quot;The Open&quot; showed me that Feinstein can go low whenever he writes about golf. Somehow, he is able to provide information that make events come alive and keep the pages turning. Having been a caddy myself in High School, I enjoyed the inside the ropes details Feinstein provided. When it comes to writing about golf, Feinstein is the man! Good shot."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein has done a masterful job yet again. He captured everything about the planning and executing of the 2002 U.S. Open. If you're looking for a &quot;typical&quot; golf book summarizing the Open, you might be disappointed. While he does cover the week of golf, Feinstein devotes the majority of his book to how the USGA went about developing everything for last year's Open. It is as much a book on managing a golf championship as it is a book about the four rounds played Thursday through Sunday. Something a little different than what I expected, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I have to admit to not being the world's biggest golf fan but in the hands of an expert storyteller like Feinstein, the sport takes on a life of its own. Initial reviews highlighted the lengthy build-up/preparation for the tournament as a negative, but the scene setting really allows the reader to delve into the psyche (not only of the players, but of the Open itself). Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"One of the more disappointing books by John Feinstein. He acts like the people putting on the 2002 U.S. Open were working on a cure for cancer. But seriously if the people described have all the abilities that Feinstein accredits them with, why aren't they doing something more meaningful than putting on a Golf Tournament. ALSO since I am a Huge Tiger Woods fan the usual Feinstein bashing of Tiger is not appreciated. One thing that surprised me is that NBC dictates pairings and starting times. If David Fay has all the integrity that Feinstein gives him credit for, he should not allow NBC to be so selective.Also, I remeber watching this event on the tube. And Feinstein does not capture the enthusiasm that New Yorkers displayed for Phil Mickelson. The Book does not mention that he was called \\"The Mick.\\"The only question was how low to rate this book. Though unscientific 3 stars \\"feels\\" right."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"First off, as has been written below, this is not a book that revolves around the golfers, as &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;Good Walk Spoiled&quot; did. It is an in-depth look at all the work and politics behind staging an Open championship (not &quot;tournament&quot;, as we are reminded seemingly countless times). The challenges run the gamut from the contract with the course, to television, to parking, to security. If these machinations do not interest you, don't bother.That being said, I enjoyed the book. As is the case with his books, he introduces seemingly countless players and provides short bios on each of them (much shorter than those in &quot;The Majors&quot;, thankfully). Good stuff, except a) there were so many people that it's simply hard to keep track of who they all are, particularly when they were last referenced 45 pages prior, and b) there really weren't any &quot;bad guys&quot; (although he didn't paint a rosy picture of Frank Hannigan). This isn't a surprise, given the fact that he was basically cozy with all of them and was their guest, but it did make for rather vanilla interaction. Surely over the course of years it took to stage this, there had to be some tension, instead they came off as one Giant Sized Cleaver Family.The golfing itself was given very short shrift, being mentioned almost in passing, which was fine with me.In short, if you are a fan of Feinstein's writing and can deal with the minutae, you will enjoy this."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, &quot; Inside the Ropes&quot;, as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"If someone told you that you could read a book about what it was like to escort the President of the United States through catering tunnels in hotels, would you want to read it? I wouldn't.Open is seriously flawed by providing me with much more information than I ever wanted to know about the USGA, biographies of its staff members, and little incidents of limited relevance to the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, the brilliantly rehabilitated course on Long Island. Two-thirds of this book could have been eliminated without taking away anything I wanted to learn about the staging of the Open.On the other hand, the book is detailed and will probably be very popular among those who know those who are described in the book or have played Bethpage Black. If you fall into either category, this is definitely a five-star book.Emblematic of the book's fundamental problem is that it fails to have a single illustration of an entire hole on the course. It would have been interesting to see what the hole layouts' and conditions were before and after the USGA paid for the fix-up.Of the many little anecdotes in the book, I liked the ones about the qualifying rounds the best. My interest is mostly in playing golf and developing great golf courses, and this book could have used more of a focus on both subjects.After you finish enjoying the book, I suggest that you visit Bethpage Black and take a look for yourself. If you don't mind getting up early in the morning, perhaps you can even play a round there.Despite not liking the book very much, I would like to compliment the USGA for its new focus on bringing the Open to courses where ordinary golfers with average incomes can pay. That's a fine contribution to the game and to us all."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Mostly rubbish - as a book and especially as a Feinstein book.John Feinstein broke new ground with &quot;A Season On The Brink&quot; and successfully used the same formula with &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; (although the former was a better book).&quot;The Open&quot; is confirmation that Feinstein has completely adopted a paint-by-numbers approach. A typical paragraph/chapter follows:...John Doe was a skilled high school/college golfer, eventually lowering his handicap to 3. He thought about joining the minitours or becoming a club/range pro but was offered a job with &lt;insert corporation&gt; out of the blue. Through mutual contacts, he met &lt;insert USGA staffer&gt; and acted as a &lt;insert golf tournament job&gt; at a local qualifier. He eventually worked his way up the USGA ladder and is now responsible for &lt;insert title or duties&gt; at the US Open and other national USGA events...There are two big problems with this approach:1) Feinstein tries his hardest to portray each person as unique, but this Mad Libs style of writing gets repetitive when applied to dozens of individuals.2) It's a transparent attempt to humanize some of the stuffed shirts at the USGA. Unfortunately, some of them are beyond rehabilitation. Tom Meeks, in particular, comes off as even more arrogant and pigheaded (which is quite an accomplishment, in a way).I don't know if it's an East Coast/Long Island/political thing, but there are far too many groups who demand some form of tribute before they will cooperate. Feinstein attempts to portray the local governments, police, and transportation officials as helpful but watchful; instead, they come off looking like the tinhorns they are. The Masters, the Memorial, any number of tournaments are carried off year after year with similar crowds and logistical problems, but those events are not treated like a moon shot. Our own wonderful Department of Energy (of the people, by the people, for the people...or something) causes problems by refusing to allow vans transporting the players to the 10th tee to drive on their precious service road. In short, the tournament was carried off in spite of all the 'help' the USGA received, not because of it.I'm sure Feinstein stayed up late trying to think of a way to inject his buddies on tour, particularly Paul Goydos, into the storyline. As luck would have it, Goydos had the very first tee time of the Open, so we are treated to more incredibly boring coverage of this journeyman. This 'everyman' approach worked well in Feinstein's first golf book, but three volumes later it has been worn threadbare.As others have stated, if you're looking for coverage/insight into the top names in golf, read the newspaper or GolfWorld. If you are dying to find out how Suzy Smith sets up her armada of cash registers in the merchandise tent, pick up a copy of &quot;The Open.&quot;"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of.

Or that the workers at Bethpage enjoyed eating sandwiches at BK Sweeney's??? Or that the guy who caddied for Tiger in his practice round was frome Ireland and his family, blah, blah, blah... Come on. It was just too much clutter and noise.This from an avid, single-digit handicapper, from Long Island, who played Bethpage Black and went to the Open on Friday in teh pouring rain!I had every reason to love this book, but instead threw it away. Save your money. I wish I had."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"John Feinstein may very well be the best golf writer around, but that doesn't mean that all of his books are instant classics like A Good Walk Spoiled. \\"Open\\" details the tournament at Bethpage in painstaking detail, from the history of the course, to the political machinations to get the tournament at the course, to the renovation of the course, to the volunteers, to the tournament itself. Although the devil is in the details, I would have appreciated more of the tournament and less of the development. Still a great read, but I wanted more golf and less golf course."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I highly recommend this book.

And reading it on my Kindle made the experience that much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books, A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors. Instead of stories about the players on the tour, this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn-out municipal golf course Bethpage Black into the great course that hosted the 2002 U.S. Open championship. I found I couldn't stop reading, as Feinstein's prose is once again funny, heartwarming, and flowing. My only critique is that I wished for more detail on Rees Jones' changes to A.G. Tillinghast's design, with illustrations. For a book about the transformation of the golf course, there isn't enough about the physical changes that were done. The book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken, so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"If you are looking for a stroke by stroke description of the Open Championship, look elsewhere. As others have pointed out, this is a story about running an Open, not playing in an Open (perhaps the subtitle is a bit misleading).If you have any interest in the topic, it's a pretty good book. Feinstein's style is pleasant and interesting and he does a nice job describing the myriad of tasks and personnel required to set up an Open. This is not as good a book as The Majors, but I enjoyed it as much as A Good Walk."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I have to admit to not being the world's biggest golf fan but in the hands of an expert storyteller like Feinstein, the sport takes on a life of its own. Initial reviews highlighted the lengthy build-up/preparation for the tournament as a negative, but the scene setting really allows the reader to delve into the psyche (not only of the players, but of the Open itself). Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"If you're looking for a fascinating book whose main purpose is not simply to provide a narration and analysis of the competition at Bethpage this book is for you. Mr. Feinstein describes the transformation of the Black course for the 2002 US Open Championship with the entusiasm of a devoted fan and the broad perspective and clarity of a truly talented golf writer and reporter. For those of us fortunate enough to participate directly at Bethpage as fans, volunteers or interested onlookers this book completes the first chapter on the use of a truly public (State owned) facility as a worthy venue for our national golf championship. Seldom, if ever, have we been allowed to glimpse the preparation for and staging of a major sporting event from start to finish. This work is as much about golf as golf is about life."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I loved &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled,&quot; Feinstein's previous book. If you haven't read that one, read it--it's fantastic. But this book was disappointing, mainly because Feinstein introduces too many characters involved with the US Open at Bethpage. And I don't mean the golfers--instead I mean the architects, administrators, maintenance people, producers, etc. Feinstein doesn't really focus on golfers very much in the book--probably the book's fatal flaw. What the PGA crew did at Bethpage was great but Feinstein tells us too much about them--after a while, I just started flipping past the pages and pages about their upbringing, their career paths, etc. I just didn't find them that interesting as people--although what they did to set-up Bethpage was interesting. But I kept on reading, thinking Feinstein's description of the actual US Open competition would be fascinating. But instead, it's truncated and not really fleshed out--not much of a payoff for reading the rest of the book. I guess &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; spoiled me for his second book."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Given that his most recent book &quot;The Punch&quot; was released recently, I figured Feinstein hastily put this book together to cash in the upsurge in interest in golf. I WAS WRONG and am happy to admit it.The author once again takes us on the &quot;inside&quot; and proffers the reader another dose of history, tradition, and day to day banter of those who help stage the world's greatest (and most democratic) championship. Feinstein grabs the reader with his poignant insights and an introduction to the jargon of those in the know (How many people will be correcting their foursomes on pin placements vs. hole locations?).The 2002 Open was truly a special and spectacular event held so close to New York during an historical time and truly an Open for the people. Feinstein does justice with this well written and easy to read tome. In fact I found myself wanting more.I noticed in the thank you portion at the end of the book that he thanks dozens of golfers, but did not mention the 2002 Champion, Tiger Woods. I really thought there might have been more on Tiger, but maybe John has been frozen out of the inner circle due to his book &quot;The First Coming: Tiger Woods: Master or Martyr&quot; Feinstein has alienated subjects in the past (right Bob Knight), but sometimes showcasing the &quot;inside&quot; leads to people reading unflattering things about themselves they wish to hide. It's the author who has to live with himself with those relationships; however once again I found myself enraptured in great sports book by Feinstein.Write on John!"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"This is a facinating book.

From a good walk spoiled to The Majors to The Punch and Now The Open Inside the Ropes at Beth Page Black Mr Feinstein know how to weave the details and the intricate fabric of an event into a interesting and page turning story. I found the lead up to be just as interesting as the guts of the tournament. Great book for all readers who enjoy a good story."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"John Feinstein's writting never sucks you in to leave you with the \\"I can't put it down\\" feeling. No, his books move slower and more methodically.But in the end his books, this title included, leave the reader with a satisfied feeling. A feeling that they have gotten an in depth look, with thorough reporting and a sometimes unique perspective, at a sports issue.The beauty of \\"Open\\" is that this event was widely reported on and covered by the media at the time of the U.S. Open. But the author's reporting starts us on this jpurney decades earlier and shows us many more reasons why this particular U.S. Open was an historic and dramatic event, aside from the obvious answers that are already known.He merges the players on the course with the players behind the scenes who made the event happen. He shows the history of the financing of the U.S. Open and how that has evolved. His wrttting is crisp and clear and he sets the scenes in the book nicely with important details about key figures that help the reader appreciate their role in the events even more.This book should appeal greatly to the golf fan and have a slightly broader appeal to those who enjoy good reporting from behind the scenes of major news events."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"What a book!!! Hard to believe you can break down one weekend and make it so fascinating! Made me want to go get a job at the USGA! What a great read, good flow, great humor but not over the top, good storyline, great characters...and it's all true!!!GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The subtitle should be, &quot;Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,&quot; because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, &quot;A Good Open Spoiled.&quot; Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Mostly rubbish - as a book and especially as a Feinstein book.John Feinstein broke new ground with &quot;A Season On The Brink&quot; and successfully used the same formula with &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; (although the former was a better book).&quot;The Open&quot; is confirmation that Feinstein has completely adopted a paint-by-numbers approach. A typical paragraph/chapter follows:...John Doe was a skilled high school/college golfer, eventually lowering his handicap to 3. He thought about joining the minitours or becoming a club/range pro but was offered a job with &lt;insert corporation&gt; out of the blue. Through mutual contacts, he met &lt;insert USGA staffer&gt; and acted as a &lt;insert golf tournament job&gt; at a local qualifier. He eventually worked his way up the USGA ladder and is now responsible for &lt;insert title or duties&gt; at the US Open and other national USGA events...There are two big problems with this approach:1) Feinstein tries his hardest to portray each person as unique, but this Mad Libs style of writing gets repetitive when applied to dozens of individuals.2) It's a transparent attempt to humanize some of the stuffed shirts at the USGA. Unfortunately, some of them are beyond rehabilitation. Tom Meeks, in particular, comes off as even more arrogant and pigheaded (which is quite an accomplishment, in a way).I don't know if it's an East Coast/Long Island/political thing, but there are far too many groups who demand some form of tribute before they will cooperate. Feinstein attempts to portray the local governments, police, and transportation officials as helpful but watchful; instead, they come off looking like the tinhorns they are. The Masters, the Memorial, any number of tournaments are carried off year after year with similar crowds and logistical problems, but those events are not treated like a moon shot. Our own wonderful Department of Energy (of the people, by the people, for the people...or something) causes problems by refusing to allow vans transporting the players to the 10th tee to drive on their precious service road. In short, the tournament was carried off in spite of all the 'help' the USGA received, not because of it.I'm sure Feinstein stayed up late trying to think of a way to inject his buddies on tour, particularly Paul Goydos, into the storyline. As luck would have it, Goydos had the very first tee time of the Open, so we are treated to more incredibly boring coverage of this journeyman. This 'everyman' approach worked well in Feinstein's first golf book, but three volumes later it has been worn threadbare.As others have stated, if you're looking for coverage/insight into the top names in golf, read the newspaper or GolfWorld. If you are dying to find out how Suzy Smith sets up her armada of cash registers in the merchandise tent, pick up a copy of &quot;The Open.&quot;"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The idea had promise, but Feinstein couldn't identify and develop the more interesting aspects of what goes on behind the scenes to stage a US Open. He reveals that Bethpage Black was always a great course, without giving any supporting reasons why. He goes into minute detail of meaningless stuff like the family histories of junior USGA staffers, yet totally fails to address the efforts or process of renovating the condition of a run-down muni course to US Open standards. He teases us with one anecdote describing USGA exec David Fay's practice of putting together US Open pairings with humorous threesomes such as &quot;Jerk Groups&quot;, without naming who the &quot;jerks&quot; were.About the only interesting thing I can say about this book is that, with Feinstein's history of treating almost every single human being in every one of his books as a saint, it is truly an indictment when he portrays someone in a negative light. In the past it was Bobby Knight (A Season On The Brink), in this book it is Tiger Woods, who he refers to as &quot;soulless&quot;, callous, unforgiving, and like most of the other characters in this book, uninteresting."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I enjoyed the book, but it certainly occurred to me in the middle of reading it that a lot of people were going to be ticked off at how misleading the title is in relation to the actual direction of the book. As has been previously mentioned repeatedly, the book is more -- MUCH more -- about the behind-the-scenes personalities than the US Open golfers themselves. Feinstein's overall theme is that the US Open is more than a golf tournament, but it's a multi-year planning process with dozens and dozens of vital people playing important roles. The problem is that he spends a few hundred pages beating this idea over the head of the reader, while the reader wonders when the actual golf is going to start. You have to sift through a great deal of mini-bios -- and some not so \\"mini\\" -- on USGA and state characters before the Open tees off.I must say that one of the main reasons I enjoyed the book was because I live 20 minutes from Bethpage Black and drive past the \\"Bethpage: Home of the 2002 US Open\\" water tower every day on my way to work -- so the geographical and course info, and other relevant stuff, caught my interest. Obviously I realize that this same info is meaningless and annoying to people not from the area, something Feinstein should have realized, and if he did, he apparently didnt care.There certainly are a bunch of patches where the reader labors through incredibly unnecessary detail, but I thought most of it was made up for with SOME of the behind-the-scenes planning process, as well as the coverage of the Open Qualifiers. There is a lot of stuff here that is very interesting and entertaining, and you can learn a lot about what goes into putting on an Open. But if you simply want to read about the 2002 US Open's golf play and analysis, I wouldnt be surprised if you quit after 100-150 pages. The actual golf coverage takes up maybe the last 20% of the book, and its not all that fulfilling even when you reach it.Simply put, the book is way too bogged down in details that have no business being in print. Outside of the families of said USGA officials, state politicians, etc., I dont know who would be the least bit interested in much of what Feinstein wrote. However, if you can stomach the rough patches and the misleading title and marketing -- and if things like network TV negotiations, traffic/parking issues, merchandise tent issues, local vs. state politics, etc. can hold your attention and intrigue you in any way -- I think you'll enjoy it. And you'll probably add a star if you're from the NY Tri-State Area."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein's creation was aptly named... \\"Open\\". The national championship is open to all entrants, the public course that hosted it was open to all who wished to play it and the USGA finally agreed to open its closed doors and allow a great author to document what goes into running this major championship.Feinstein allows the reader to be a fly on the wall as David Fay (Executive Director of the USGA) formulates his dream of hosting the U.S. Open on a truly public facility and watches that dream become a stunning reality. Along the way he answers a number of questions that the avid and/or casual golf fan has probably wondered: How do they create the pairings? How do they choose the host course? What exactly does the USGA do and how do they interact with the PGA Tour?Feinstein also captures the pride and character of the New Yorkers who call the course home and couldn't wait to see how the best players in the world would fare on The Black. As one of those New Yorkers myself, I can truly say that Feinstein's narrative on this point is right on the money.The only criticism I have is around his chronology of the final round. He states that Tiger was on 13th hole when the weather delay hit, but Tiger had yet to tee of on 12 when they halted play. This becomes even more important when one considers the tee shot Tiger had to hit after a 45 minute delay on 12, the longest par 4 in U.S. Open history. As Roger Maltbie said on the NBC coverage - \\"I can't think of a another tee shot I would least like to hit than this one after a rain delay.\\" Tiger, of course, striped it 300 yds down the middle and made par on his way to the championship.I was fortunate enough to volunteer at last year's Open all four days and I look forward to doing it again in 2009 when it returns."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"In his book \\"Open...Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black\\" John Feinstein truly takes you inside the ropes at one of the most talked about golf championships in history. Beyond Golf, the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black was unusual for so many reasons. From the inner workings at the USGA, The New York State Parks Department, NBC Sports, to the Long Island Railroad, you get a real sense this was more than a typical 72 holes of Golf. Be prepared to miss a few rounds as this is a difficult book to put down."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"John Feinstein finds a lot more interesting things about the preparations for the 2002 U.S. Open than I would. He writes about parking pressures and vendor pilfering the way Cornelius Ryan wrote about D-Day.Those expecting a play-by-play on the golf played during those four days in June, which saw Tiger Woods break away the first day and never look back, may be disappointed. Even when the book's narrative finally reaches the event itself, after some 260 pages, the focus remains on the behind-the-scenes organizers, the USGA, NBC, and state officials. It's a unique situation, Feinstein reminds us, to have used a municipal course to host the U.S. Open, but maybe it's not worth writing a book about.That said, Feinstein's book is an interesting read, especially for those who care about things like event management, sports broadcasting, or professional golf. As an author, Feinstein is much more engaged than he was when he wrote &quot;The Majors,&quot; his style coming up to that of his classic &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled.&quot;Some of his wit is back in evidence. When a volunteer realizes Tiger used the Porta-John he helped set up, he calls a friend to share the good news. &quot;Yes, Woods thrilled people in many different ways,&quot; Feinstein concludes.I also liked the fact he doesn't hold back with the players, something I noticed and minded with &quot;The Majors&quot; after his no-holds-barred approach in &quot;Good Walk Spoiled.&quot; Woods still won't shake a TV reporter's hand 18 months after that reporter said Woods was in a &quot;slump.&quot; Sergio Garcia has his star moments, while Jeff Maggert comes across as totally unpleasant. At least Feinstein whipping boy John Daly's on his best behavior this time around.The portraits of the organizers and staff that center this book are smoother, and maybe Feinstein finds more of interest about them than you will. It's an interesting tack to take, though, writing not about the game's stars but those who help to make such marquee events happen. Feinstein is in uncharted territory here, and maybe reclaiming some lost ground as golf's most original working writer.That said, &quot;The Open&quot; is still a bore in parts, and lacks a strategic or historical overview of what makes Bethpage's Black Course so special. What did course designer A.W. Tillinghast do with the track that was so unique, and how did it preserve that notoriety over the decades as an overused Long Island muni? There's a splendid tale about golf course architecture waiting to get out here that never quite does.All the same, &quot;The Open&quot; is good for what it is, an appreciation of a very underappreciated aspect of sport. Too bad it isn't a little more interesting, but for those who care (and there are many, given golf's popularity), it will probably be worth your while to check it out."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Those who buy this book thinking they are going to get the inside story of the US Open golf tournament held at Bethpage Black in 2002 are going to be disappointed. The tournament doesn't even start until page 262.What this book is about is how the United States Golf Association decided to bring it's prestigious Open Championship to a municipal golf course on Long Island, rather than the famed country clubs which have hosted this event since it's inception and what goes in to putting on such an event. The title says&quot; Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black.&quot; What you really get is inside the workings of the USGA, what goes on behind the scenes, how decisions are made (or not),how catastrophes were avoided (or not)and in the end you may have learned more about what was involved in bringing this tournament to this course than you really wanted to know.To those of us who follow golf closely and have attended a US Open, this is a very interesting read. Feinstein researches his subject exhastively and tells the story in an interesting manner, but at the end of the book I don't believe the reader has gotten a full measure of what has been promised. So, be aware of what the book is about and what it is not about, and if it is your cup of tea, read on."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I am really ticked off and feel that somebody at Little, Brown publishing co. owes me $26. This is the worst book about golf I've ever read, and I've read a lot.Feinstein is generally a fantastic writer and in the past I've really enjoyed his stuff . . . so imagine how disappointing this was when I found out that it not only was NOT his usual great work . . . and that in reality, this one is really a 5-star stinker.Here's the problem: If you look at the book's dust cover, there is a guy teeing-off and gallery on both sides looking on. Look at the back of the jacket and there's Tiger and others. Read the title, &quot;Open -- Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black&quot;, and adding all that up you'd think that this would be a book about the open, inside stories about the golfers and personal looks at them and their lives and their games. You know, the kind of stuff that made Feinstein's other books so much fun to read.Inside the jacket the blurb talks about Tiger, Sergio, Nick, Phil, etc., so you figger you'll be reading about them. Uh-uh.Imagine, then, how the reader feels when this book slogs on and on about Barney McFeeley and Harry O'Howsmigolfin' and Freddie Fatsohuffinpuffin and whoever these old geezers at the USGA are . . . stories not about golf, but about executives and bureaucrats having to do work (! wow, imagine that!) to set up an open at Bethpage Black (and the reverence for this golf course really gets on one's nerves, I mean, come on already). Bo-ring, boring, boring! But I suppose this sold well on Long Island and in the New York area. . .I don't blame Feinstein, the author. He wrote a book about a boring topic and was probably misled by his publisher into thinking this would be a big hit. And his editor, well, what could he do with a can of crud like this. But Little, Brown, knowing they had a bomb on their hands, did the unethical thing, and that is to market this as something it's not.Little, Brown if you are out there, please email me.

He's dream was to make Bethpage Black an open. This dream came to him in 1995 and in 2002 it came true, with the help of many others like Craig Currier (superintendent) Mary Lopuszynski (sales) and many other important characters. David Fay is about to figure out all these problems because there is nothing that will get in his way of making Bethpage an open. So don't you think he will follow through? Well find out.This book is non-fiction and reads very smooth. John Feinstein did a good job of using very specific details so pay close attention. This book does not only teach you about golf it teaches you good life lessons that are unforgettable. I think this book is best suited for sports readers who want a good book to read and they will not put it down. The good thing about this book is that it makes you pay attention the bad thing is that it jumps around a little bit.

From both personal and second-hand experiences, I can say that this book will make your life miserable. The authors attempt to give the readers a deeper understanding of calculus concepts, but go about it an an obtuse and incredibly disorienting fashion. The book is chock-full of obscure references, half-hearted derivations, dizzying metaphors and incredibly bad jokes. Trying to follow this text is like trying to follow the wing movements of a hummingbird on steroids.Also, the authors of this book are devious in their methods. They are constantly re-issuing new editions, and because they have a vice grip on their school's math department, students are forced to buy new editions every semester. This means after suffering our way through an entire semester of this dreadful text, we can't even get a decent deal when we try to sell back our books, because it is a new edition has been released.

I graduated with a 3.6 in my undergrad and 3.9 in my doctorate.With that said, I could not make head or tail of what on earth they were trying to get us to do in this text! From my understanding, they were trying to teach us not the function of Calculus, but how to reason your way through it?!? However, this is not appropriate for a beginner. I met with the prof individually...I enlisted the help of other students in Advanced Calc II to help me understand the assignments. Guess what? The Advanced Calc II students had no idea how to help me. Does that tell you anything?I ended up dropping the class because I thought I was going to get a B.

Students talk more math than do math!! The authors seem to thoroughly go against the classics that emphasizes the &quot;symbolic&quot; approach more than &quot;numerical and graphical&quot;.

I qualified to take the 300 level math which is Calc II, but decided on Math 226, which is Calculus I at my university. The material looks challenging, and for me since I only took AP Stats my senior year, I've forgotten a bit of Calculus.

I used it in my Calc class and liked it. It is funny in places."},{"Title":"Calculus: From Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View","review":"Most of the other reviews have it wrong. I imagine they are mostly from calculus students who got grades they didn't want, which isn't hard to do no matter WHAT book is used. I'd hate to think any calculus teachers downrated this book. It's a prize winner.I teach advanced placement calculus; have for 34 years, during which time I've seen and used a LOT of calculus texts. This book is an excellent treatment of the topics of calculus--not Real Analysis, for math majors, but great for its intended audience.Most of my students read the book since I encourage that. Most who read it report that they like it, especially the humor. Those who don't like it no doubt dislike the lack of example after example after example after example after example that dull the mind and prepare the reader ONLY for those numerous similar-if-not-identical problems in the homework.Not an easy read? It's CALCULUS! Read it slowly for comprehension, with a pencil. It's not a novel.But it IS NOVEL. Its concept-oriented approach is quite unlike the traditional algebraic approach. We have computer algebra systems today; UNDERSTANDING the CONCEPTS of calculus is what's more important and Ostebee and Zorn provide this through a variety of thought-provoking problems. In most sections, no two are alike. FAR from traditional-looking.As a reform text, it is unusual in that they built the book from the ground up. None of this, \\"OK, we're getting pressure to put in graphing calculator problems; let's make volume umpteen different--put little calculator icons next to every 3rd problem and add a few lines to each chapter and stick 'Graphing Calculator' in the title\\" approach taken by other authors and companies.But it's not just for high school AP calculus. Many colleges use it. Do an internet search. No, it's not as widely used as some of the aforementioned modifications of older popular texts, and should NOT be unless instructor and student are unwilling to think, assimilate, and apply concepts constantly. P.S. This is a sure fire way to learn ANYthing."},{"Title":"Calculus: From Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View","review":"I used this book for my calc class and while it is an interesting and noble approach at changing the way calculus is being taught today, it lacks the ability to explain things on the student's level.

Personally, I got so fed up with this that I threw this book (softcovered edition) on the wall of my dormitory hundreds of times throughout the semester out of frustration. I was lucky that I had an EXCELLENT professor during my first semester of Calculus.* the \\"proofs\\" that are used are mostly examples or counterexample and do not rigerously explain the \\"why\\" questions?* needs organization* not enough examples to adequately solve end of chapter problems; humans learn through example* some typographical errorsPro's: Some of the end of the chapter problems are ingenious and help provide the student with a deeper understanding of the material.Overall: If you are a student forced to use this text you should obtain another book (Hostetler for example) to supplement the reading material and attend all lectures.

In the others I could always follow their examples and relate them to the homework questions. In this book the example problems have nothing to do with the homework questions.

If you want to challenge your mind in this way, this book is probably the most suitable for you. I am using it in my calculus calss, and I found the concepts are very clearly explained. The thing that I love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions. This only imperfection of the book, if any, is that there lack of some theoretical exercises. But any book can not be perfect. The most important thing is how you enjoy it. For me, it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus."},{"Title":"Calculus: From Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View","review":"I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition, and this Ostebee-Zorn text demonstrates why. This book attempts to make calculus easy to understand, but the only result is that it is impossible to follow. Essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage, and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow. Add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual. As a teaching assistant, I have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result. With so many quality calculus textbooks on the market, it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment."},{"Title":"Calculus: From Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View","review":"I praise Ostebee and Zorn for making an attempt to make calculus easy and for everyone. But I just don't think that is true. Calculus is a sophisticated form of mathematics and sometimes it needs to be taught with vocabulary and methods within the mathematics community and outside of everyday life. When you combine this with the usual high number of mistakes present in a first-edition book, a great deal of the phrase &quot;we'll discuss/define this soon&quot;, excessive use of the graphing calculator, and some pretty lame jokes, you get a product that's not really worthy of being used in a college-level course."},{"Title":"Calculus: From Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View","review":"I bought the book for college and it has served it's purpose.

Neil lives with his Aunt Gladys and uncle Max in Newark, while Brenda lives in Short Hills, a rich neighborhood.

They did not appeal to me, and I insist that I am not a Roth basher. Letting Go is a great American classic (see my amazon review), I very much liked Indignation, and I am engrossed in the Zuckerman novels now. But this collection is distinctly inferior in my opinion.For one thing, and I'm not going to rant and harp on all the little things that bothered me, there are many inaccuracies and implausabilities. Brenda's parents let Neil, the boy friend, live with them for two weeks in the summer? They would not be that nave. Ron, Brenda's brother, likes Mantovani? Come on! Pat Boone maybe but not Mantovani. Neil works at the library and helps out the artistic black kid. What a great guy Neil is. How very contrived and unconvincing. And so on.I come from exactly the same background and milieu as Roth, but I am about ten years younger. We are probably (distant) cousins. And I am telling you it was not like that, not like it was portrayed in Goodbye, Columbus. (Although I will admit that the dialogue is often brilliant. Roth is always a master of dialogue.)As for the other stories: \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" is ludicrous, and marital infidelity revealed by a rash? All of the stories are amateurish and unconvincing. Perhaps these stories are bizarre Kafkaesque fantasies. They are not realistic portrayals and explorations of life. Nor are they particularly entertaining as fantasies, either.That's my opinion. So there. Revile me."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I guess somebody scanned a paper version of this book to build the kindle edition, as it appears to be filled with OCR errors.The content of the writing is enjoyable, but the kindle-edition typos are a real buzzkill for getting into the book.Get it in paperback, skip the kindle edition."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I found the protagonist of the title story to be a bit shallow, and some of the situations a bit dated (sorry, I refuse to believe your daughter getting a diaphragm is the end of civilization) but aside from that, Goodbye Columbus is an extremely strong first book. You can see from his first work that Roth has a sincere and abiding interest in the post-war Jewish American community. And a lot of the concerns of his later writing are first examined here. The conflict between different familial generations, the ways we escape from our traditions, the ways we are still bound by them, sexuality (it wouldn't be a Roth book without sex), etc. His ear for yiddish-tinged dialogue is really rich and wonderful, and he seems to have more or less cornered the market on writing about jewish mothers and aunts with both humor and sympathy. 'The Conversion of the Jews' is one of the most anarchically funny things I've read in a long time. It alone should be required reading for any aspiring wise-guy"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"This was the book that put Roth on the map in a big way, and I had been looking forward to reading it for quite a while. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. It it is not that it was bad in any way, it just was not especially interesting in any way. Still, I will probably hang onto it because one of the short stories is great.GC is a short novel that follows the relationship of two young Jewish Americans in the 1950s. Neil Klugman is a kid from blue collar Newark who works in the town library and seems to be rather aimless about his future. He gets involved with Brenda Patimkin, a girl from the right side of the tracks, the daughter of a successful self-made businessman. She goes to Wellesley, wears the best clothes, and is an all-around J.A.P. It is hard to know what really brings them together and keeps them together for a whole summer, but the dialogue is very believable. The story is told in first person by Neil, and he relates how he gets to know the Patimkin clan, her regular guy dad, her polite but neurotic mother, and her jock brother. The title comes from a record the brother, Ron, has about saying goodbye to Ohio State after his last basketball game there. Altho Neil is accepted by the Patimkins, he never really fits in and never really takes to their way of life. It is in some ways an interesting look at 1950s America, but in other ways it is quite ordinary. Maybe life has not changed very much since then. At its best, Roth's prose is dryly witty and insightful. His style is regular and low-key. My guess is that his success has 'derived primarily from his timely choice of subject matter and the easy, accessible nature of the writing, but not knowing the other books too well, that is just a guess.Of the short stories, there were two that interested me. \\"Epstein\\" is about what I guess you could call a midlife crisis. An overweight Brooklyn businessman, surrounded by sex and youth, struggling with the continuing pain of his son's premature death, strikes up an affair with a widowed neighbor. The scene in which his wife finds out something is wrong - in which he has a rash on his thighs, and begins covering it up - is outrageously, painfully funny. \\"Defender of the Faith\\" is the best thing in the book - in it, a Jewish sergeant, back in the States after fighting in Germany, finds himself taken advantage of by a manipulative, fast-talking little private who uses their common faith as a way to wheedle favors out of the guy. At the end, the sergeant pulls a string of his own."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"A great collection that really acts as a first rate introduction to Philip Roth.In 'Columbus' where poor boy Neil becomes enamoured with rich girl Brenda after holding her glasses at the pool, you not only have a love story of Neils insecurities and self doubt that a rich girls motives are true,but great comic dialogue and characterisations that captures the changing culture of increasingly assimilated jews in America who's roots are still with their faith. Leo Patimkin's tales of poverty;Aunt Glady's world weary monologues-all seem to have grown and become part of jewish culture today. A story definately from the 50's when it was written, but with a timelessness as it captures so much of what makes us all human.The five short stories carry the whole Roth range; many of the tales and themes being re-enacted in his later novels.Again, the huge strength in character,dialogue, language and observation-added to the ability to tell a good story-shine. All look at the jew in the post holocaust world and the clash of old and new.'Defender of the Faith' is a stand out; a manipulative young soldier uses his faith to create an 'us' against 'them', yet is only too willing to trample over anyone for his own ends. 'Epstein' sees a man get a nasty rash after a brief affair (wonder what novel this gave fruit to?!)and 'Eli the Fanatic' tells of the assimilation of jews into modern scientific America and society, to the point of denial and shame.This book is perfect Roth; the one I would recommend if anyone wanted to know what he's like and all about."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"This is not a literary review of Philip Roth's work, but of the quality of this digital translation. I'm only into about the first 50 pages or so, but got so annoyed with the high frequency of typos in this digital version that I felt compelled to bring it to Amazon's attention. I just bought my Kindle a few days ago and this is actually my first digital book I'm reading, so I have nothing to compare it to in terms of frequency, other than paper books, however, for the price that Amazon is charging to download these books, the quality of proofreading should be just as good or better! This is unexceptionable."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I turned to Philip Roth's first novel, the National Book Award winner \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" (1959) after reading Roth's latest book, the short novel \\"Nemesis\\" (2010)NemesisI wanted to compare the themes and writing of this great American storyteller over these long years. And this was my first reading of Roth's early masterpiece. While an excellent book, \\"Nemesis\\" does not have the verve of Roth in his rambunctious, iconoclastic youth.Both the early and the late Roth novels feature a 23-year old male Jewish protagonist from the lower middle class of Newark, New Jersey. In \\"Goodbye Columbus\\", the chief character and narrator is Neil Klugman who, as the story begins is a graduate in philosophy from a local public university who has served in the army and is working in the local public library until he determines what he wants to do with his life. Neil is living with his aunt and uncle to save on the rent; his parents have relocated for health reasons to Tuscon. Roth has a remarkable ear for colloquialism and for the rhythmic speech patterns of Newark Jews.The story centers on a summer romance between Neil and Brenda Patimkin of the suburb of Short Hills. Brenda's family had its origins in Newark, but with the economic success of the father's business in kitchen and bathroom sinks, the Patimkin's have relocated to a wealty suburban home with all the amenities. Brenda is a student at Radcliffe and is spending the summer at home. \\"Nemesis\\", set earlier in the 1940s has a somewhat similar pairing of wealthy and poor Jews. Its protagonist is a young man, nicknamed \\"Bucky\\" (and Brenda Patimkin goes by the nickname of \\"Buck\\") who is in love with a wealthier girl, Miriam, the daughter of a physician from the near suburbs, and who visits her, at her invitation, at a summer camp in the Poconos far from sweltering Newark.Roth's Jewish characters frequently have a passion for sports and athletic activity, probably to counter stereotypes of over-intellectualized individuals. In \\"Nemesis\\" young Bucky is a physical education instructor who is gifted at hurling the javelin and at diving. In \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" as well, much of the story turns of Brenda's prowess at tennis and at Neil's ability to run. Equally important Brenda's older brother is a recent graduate of the University of Ohio, Columbus, where he starred on the basketball team. Much of \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" centers upon the brother's garish wedding to a young woman from the midwest.\\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" tells the story of the relationship between Neil and Brenda, which begins in chance, and quickly over a summer becomes intense and sexual. Brenda, pampered, wealthy, and spoiled and the rough around the edges Neil are attracted to and seem to want to love each other. But their relationship teeters upon their differences in economic background which led to suspicions and jealousy and backbiting. Neither family trusts the other, and ultimately the two young people cannot find a place for one another. Roth portrays masterfully these different social classes in American Judaism of the 1950's and the strong tensions between people of essentially the same background. He writes with genuine sadness about the failed relationship and with, in light of the criticism Roth's early work sometimes received, sympathy for both his flawed protagonists and their families. And in \\"Nemesis\\", Roth's late novel, he writes with nostalgia and affection for the Jewish community of his youth, both those of the poor inner city and those who had managed through education to reach the suburbs. In addition to showing the difference in class and wealth, Roth's novel turns upon the sexually repressive mores of the 1950s, a theme which also finds its place in \\"Nemesis\\" and in many of Roth's other novels.The short early novel of about 135 pages is masterfully written for a young writer as Roth develops both character and location. He is more at home with Newark than with the suburbs, writing, for example, \\"Once I'd driven out of Newark, past Irvington and the packed-in tangle of railroad crossings, switchment, shacks, lumberyards,Dairy Queens, and used car lots, the night grew cooler.\\" (p8) The plot develops with an inner logic and with tension. Every step tells and contributes to the story. To take one example, Neil describes his encounter with a young African American boy at the Newark library who escapes into the stacks to look at art books of Gaughin's portraits of Tahitans. (At that time many young boys looked at art books to see nude human bodies. Roth's young child seems to have a larger-based interest). There are parallels between Neil's relationship to the young boy on the one hand and his relatiomship to Brenda on the other. And the child's fascination with the far-away Tahiti suggests Neil's longing for the seemingly unattainable world of Short Hills and Brenda.In addition to \\"Goodbye,Columbus\\" this edition also includes five stories Roth wrote as a fledgling author. These stories seem to be the basis for stories that Roth attributed to the young writer, Nathan Zuckerman, in his book, \\"The Ghost Writer\\"The Ghost Writerwhich received criticism, in Roth's telling, for their claimed negative portrayal of American Jews. The best of these five stories is \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" which shows Roth's fascination with and skepticism about theological questions. Both \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" and \\"Nemesis\\" share this preoccupation with religion which ends, in both early and late Roth, in secularism.An astonishing early effort, \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" remains one of Roth's best works and is an excellent introduction to this author. I have been reading a good deal of Roth of late. This is a book I would have liked to have read when younger.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"This was my first Philip Roth set of stories, which is probably fitting since it was his first published collection of stories. At the time the collection garnered heaps of praise, eventually winning the National Book Award and starting a career that continues to this very day (if I recall Roth has a book out very recently, actually). And since I haven't read the rest of his work I can't really put this into context or say if he got any better or more incisive or whatnot. All I can really do is talk about this.And I have to say, it's pretty good.The title story is typically the one that gets all the attention and for the most part it's deservedly so. The story of a young Newark Jew's summer romance with a Short Hills Jew (and being from New Jersey myself, the very fact that I've been to some of these towns is exciting in itself) and his interactions with her well-to-do family succeeds by being very sharply focused, a slice of a year that winds up telling us way more about the characters than they ever do. It's Roth's keen eye for details that work here, an offhand description, a revealing exchange of dialogue. The small moments, like the \\"goodbye, Columbus\\" sequence that gets everyone's attention. Nothing in here is overtly \\"literary\\", he's not trying to do any formalist tricks, he's simply telling a story. And yet it's an examination disguised as a story, a switch that we never notice and only makes the story more deeply felt. It feels entirely naturalistic, like it happened to Roth itself, even if it didn't, but it's wrapped into a distinctly Jewish perspective as well as examining the nature of class. From early on you can see it not ending well, but given the characters there's no other way it could end. You believe in these people even if you don't necessarily like them.\\"Goodbye Columbus\\" is so quietly good that we don't notice how good it is until we read the rest of the collection and see how the other stories measure up. And while there's no missteps, nothing rises quite to the level of that first story. \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" is the other big name here and comes close to deserving that status as well. It's more focused on the nature of being Jewish than \\"Goodbye Columbus\\", telling the story of a young boy challenging his religion through honest questioning and how that doesn't go over well. That story succeeds gloriously in its ending, with the final sequences causing the story to finally take flight, showing how accepting what you're told is never welcome, if that accepting causes pain for others. It reminds me of Henry Roth's \\"Call It Sleep\\", only without the underlying anger and the other Roth's more deliberate attempt to be literary.The rest are decent. \\"Defender of the Faith\\" depicts a Jewish soldier's attempts to deal with some other Jewish soldiers who are trying to get ahead of the game. It doesn't make anyone look good and in fact doesn't really make Jews in general look good, with everyone coming off as fairly manipulative for petty reasons. On the other hand, the ending is amazingly brutal in a quiet fashion. \\"You Can't A Man By the Song He Sings\\" is entertaining and slight but nothing more than that. \\"Epstein\\" feels like another Henry Roth piece, dealing with the despair of getting older and discovering that you've done nothing exciting with your life when you had the chance. \\"Eli, the Fanatic\\" is actually fairly interesting, examining Jews who aren't very fond of other Jews, when a more orthodox crew moves into town. The scenes where Eli, of a more conventional faith, has to deal with the newcomers, makes them feel alien even though both scenes share the same beliefs.What comes across in all these stories, no matter the quality, is Roth's voice. There is a definite Jewish point of view, not always flattering (often not flattering) and as such the stories examine a certain people's relationships with society and each other and how their faith informs the actions they take, overtly or otherwise. As a people, the Jews share a unity and history that many other faiths don't possess and sometimes that's not easily understood (I'm not Jewish, so interpret that as you will) but Roth gives us his view of a society that he understands all too well and even if he can't give us the roadmap on how to understand ourselves, at least he can show us where to start."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Here is Roth's masterpiece-in-stories, six pieces dealing with his trademark themes of love, assimilation, and maybe even despair. It begins with the famous title story, a startingly realistic college love story with deadly accurate characterization and a painfully truthful conclusion. From there Roth delves deeply into the American Jewish psyche, with characters that morph from sharply denying to acutely embracing their faith and spirituality. The overall feeling upon completing the book is of people forgetting their faith in the midst of a burgeoning sense of acculturation, and the shock delivered to the system when, through fate or circumstance, one has to deal with their fundamental self. Like the best of the fiction of its time, it is incredibly readable while also having a stunning tone and underlying structure. Every story is a knockout here, and will make you want to stay in the crazy yet somehow warm world that Roth creates. That he wrote such a collection at such a young age is stunning; thankfully it was the herald of a consistently brilliant career. An outstanding collection."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"In this initial work of Philip Roth, the characters almost seem too realistic at times. Though this is a collection of short stories, the title piece shines as the highlight of the set. Without a doubt, this is among Roth's finest works.\\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is an authentic tale of summer love shattered by an uncompromising society much like Romeo and Juliet. While one can doubt the strength of the young love of Neil and Brenda, the sound of young hearts breaking touches the reader. It is tale of conflict in love, caste, and mores in the era before the pill.Like \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\", the other stories use the Jewish faith as a central theme. \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" and \\"Defender of the Faith\\" are humorous tales that follow a theme suggested by the title. The scandalous lives led in \\"Epstein\\" with a skin rash serving as its conflict and \\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Songs He Sings\\" with mafia men in training stretch the boundaries of reality into humorousness.Any fan of Roth is certain to be delighted in this set. Though I am not usually a fan of short story sets, I took great pleasure in this collection."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"It's a literary masterpiece, realistic as it can be, Goodbye Columbus makes you feel as if you were 19 again.

It talks about the relationship between a middle class Jew and an upper class Jew. Phillip Roth exposes the differences between classes and uses the characters to show in a great manner the way of living and thinking of each part of the society. It also shows the lack of commitment that some teenagers may have and the problems that this may cause. Not to spoil the whole book for the readers the last thing that should be said is that the book is entertaining, even though some of the characters are not likeable; especially Neil. Everyone should read this book if they want to pass a good time and if they want to know about social conflicts."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Wow, what an enjoyable novella! I really love the simplicity of the story and the humor in it which would become Roth's trademark, along with his flawed protagonist. The five short stories are enjoyable as well and, together with the novella, form a very intriguing set of existential stories. I think Roth showed so much promise with this work that, despite the fact that he is one of America's premier writers today, I don't know if he's ever fulfilled that potential."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Reading this book I felt like I was reading Judy Blume's Forever but from the male perspective, in which that loser character from Forever gets to speak for himself and reveal just how much of a loser he really is.Romance between working class Jew and Jewish American Princess and the tensions. My girlfriend told me that it reminded her of me in that the working class guy is constantly challenging and fighting with his girlfriend in order to cover up his own insecurities. Our relationship got better after that.You don't really pay attention to the psychological aspect the first time because it's all about sex, when are they going to have sex, how often are they going to have sex, is she going to get birth control? And like i said before, the female character is not at all like the subdued Ali MacGraw in the movie. She's a harpy from the main characters perspective. When the story ends on a Portnoy's Complaint type note you are both laughing and sorrowful.The other stories are ok. Not great. THey also follow the idea of Jewish assimilation and how it works and doesn't work for Jews. The one about the soldier that uses shared ethnicity as an excuse for getting out of work is good and The Conversion of the Jews is for anyone whose ever hated Hebrew School."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"A fascinating look at a young man who is beginning to question his youthful ideals.

It is beautifully written and very real."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"a very interesting debate about love of social classe"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Philip Roth was unknown to me until I noticed 3 of his books in my roommates collection. I chanced across a copy of this book at a Salvation Army. Man, can this guy write! I wasn't that impressed with Goodbye Columbus; the characters weren't too likeable. (actually, a lot of his characters aren't that likeable.) But &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, about some Jewish soldiers in WWII, blew me away. Absolutely one of the finest short stories I've ever read, right up there with Shirley Jackson's &quot;The Lottery&quot; and Ray Bradbury's &quot;The Veldt&quot;. The other short stories are also of highest quality, especially &quot;Conversion of the Jews&quot;. Be warned, though. He deals with very sensitive issues about the Jewish people &amp; faith. And he doesn't pull punches. As a gentile, I took his comments in stride, but I can see where people might get offended. There were a few times when I said &quot;He did not write that, did he?&quot; However, these issues are obviously very personal to him, and he must write what he feels. A highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"What's to say? The collection is brilliant ... as is most of his work. End of story.This guy and Updike ... they don't get any better."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"\\"GOODBYE, COLUMBUS is the first book published by the american writer Philip Roth in the late fifties. Neil Klugman is a young intellectual working in a Public Library near New-York City. He falls in love with Brenda Patimkin who belongs to a rather wealthy family of the Jewish Bourgeoisie. Excellent descriptions of the different social classes composing the american jewish society of 1955, smart dialogs and an humoristic style. Highly recommended.\\"Daniel Staebler, Resident Scholar"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"A friend, who is an admirer of Roth's other works, especially American Pastoral, dismisses this as \\"sentimental nonsense.\\" I argue that \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" - the story itself, forget the five other stories (although they're good too) - is a classic. Certainly it is written in an autobiographical vein, and depends on its readers' emotions to be effective, but there is something more to this book.And I think lots of people miss that \\"something\\" when they say that \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is about \\"capitalism\\" or \\"social class\\" or even about secular Jews trying to find themselves - let alone each other - in our crazy, modern world. All of these critiques are right at some points, but they miss the crucial thing: \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is a love story, a very scary love story.If Roth gets anything right with Neil and Brenda, it is their absolute inability to communicate despite being two of the most educated people on earth. Neil thinks he's advancing the relationship - telling Brenda he cares - when he tells her to visit Sanger's clinic. He thinks by catering to her every whim that he's loving her. (What she thinks is unclear. The story is told from Neil's point of view and doesn't show Brenda to be particularly moral, or even thinking along such lines, at all.)And maybe in some perfect world, Neil would be right, his love would be made truly manifest in such things. But even he knows he's living a dream, at best. All that's left in terms of love in a world without commitment and tenderness is carnality, and that only goes so far...As I said, a classic. You'll have to read the book to find out if I'm right about it."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Readers starting out with Philip Roth might think this - his first book, published way back in 1959 - is the logical place to begin. But they might have a far richer experience if they come to it, as I did, after reading all of the Zuckerman novels along with \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" and Roth's slim but insightful volume of autobiography, \\"The Facts\\". So much of Roth's work is preoccupied with what it means to be a Jewish writer that it was fascinating to read, through the lens of that half-century of history, the book that began it all. Knowing (from \\"The Facts\\"), for example, what happened when Roth appeared on a panel at the Yeshiva University in New York in 1962, you can imagine just how incendiary some of this material might have seemed for Jews in post-war America. In story after story Roth troubles the notions that would be put to the young Nathan Zuckerman in the later novel, \\"The Ghost Writer\\". Should the Jewish writer suppress aspects of his work to avoid or counter anti-Semitism? Or should he be honest and risk including something that might \\"warm the heart of a Julius Streicher or a Joseph Goebbels?\\" There's plenty here to offend those who don't accept that Jews are human beings with all the complexities and contradictions that entails. Roth's agenda is not to insult his heritage, but to explore the anxiety of Jewish people as they struggle, for example, with feeling American but being treated like aliens; or wanting to assimilate yet wanting, equally, to maintain and defend their right to elements of their traditional culture; or, by the same token, wrestling with defending their faith against members of it who cynically exploit its observances and kindship for personal gain. The aspect of this book that troubled many, I suspect, is that Roth doesn't provide answers to these troubles. Rather, he seems to have followed Chekhov's advice to Alexei Suvorin: \\"You are right in demanding that an artist approach his work consciously, but you are confusing two concepts: the solution of a problem and the correct formulation of a problem. Only the second is required of the artist.\\" That's something the reader would do well to remember, too."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Neil first sees the elusive Brenda when she asks him to hold her glasses at the country club Neil is visiting. This book is a vital part of the collection of writingsabout the American Jewish experience. Through the puzzlingrelationship of two young people, one rich and one poor-the conflict of Jews who have made it and those who have not is evident.The brutal business world is shown through the crude,unsophisticated yet loving manner of Mr. Patimkin, a sinkmaker and his brother, a salesman.This first generation has struggled for wealth and admires it while Ron, Brenda, and her boyfriend are foreign to Judaism and to the desire and necessity of earning a good living. Brenda's mother struggles with the ambition to be young and beautiful like her daughter and is angry at her daughter because Brenda is used to luxury. Brenda and her boyfriend finally end their summer fling as they realize the divide between their worlds really is too great. The metaphor of Brenda being too nearsighted to see without her glasses continues as she is too &quot;myopic&quot; to manage to sustain their relationship. She is sorry but unwilling to grow or sacrifice for Neil."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"My favorite Roth book. There's a yearning here in a young man who loves a girl he really has nothing in common with. Roth captures the summer romance of youth. During the day, hanging out at her parents house and eating their food without feeling they have to pay for anything. And at night, he steals into her bed, sneaking into movies that are half over. It has a real fifties-early sixties feel, and I highly recommended the film (When I first saw it as a teenager it stunned me because I never saw a romance in films that didn;t work out because of differences--I mean it's Hollywood right, doesn;t everything end happily and people see the error of their ways through love. Well no.) I think the book is an excellent way for anyone to remember their own summer loves. It's plaintive, irritating, and awkward feel--really, the way I recall those moments too. Being in love but trying to find yourself as life comes between you and your youth. I re-read this book every year, and my only complaint is the male character isn't fleshed out enough, but then I think that is the way of being young and self-conscious, the adult world shifts by you, you feel detached and an observor. But passion is passion and it's there. And rueful but appreciated memories."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"First Love is a really wonderful novella that was the first work of Philip Roth. It was published in 1959 and won the National Book Award.What makes it so wonderful? The quality of the prose is exceptional. It is precise and often poetic without ever using that overly precious tone from which many short story authors suffer. Roth takes careful aim at upwardly mobile Jewish life-- most of the stories in the volume look at least subtly at the internal (identity) clash that arises as Jewish families start integrating into the mainstream middle class. What's nice is that he is unflinching and often critical without ever feeling as though he were being mean. Goodbye Columbus is beautiful and thought provoking, wry but not bitter.The novella is published together with five short stories, \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\", \\"Defender of the Faith\\", \\"Epstein\\", \\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings\\", and \\"Eli, the Fanatic\\". \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" is generally considered the best of the lot, but personally I was more drawn to \\"Defender of the Faith\\". All five stories are worth reading, even if they are not as strong as the title novella.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Indeed a book worth reading. Neil and Brenda\`s love affair is a clear example of materialism in love affairs. They also show a great amount of common sense as developed by Roth, which is very representative of his own life. Although brief, the characters are well developed, their attitudes are representative of the temporal setting (around the 60's), which sets the mood effectively.At first, we thought that the story was a bit slow, but near the end, the finale is magnificently narrated, showing the characters more humane than in any other part of the novel. We would recommend this story because you might feel connected to any of the main characters. Finally, don't forget to take a look at the title's symbolism; this can be a key factor in determining the true meaning of the novel (Tahiti-Gaugin-The Patimikin's fridge filled with exotic fruit-Christopher Columbus?-New World?-Neil's New World?)."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I think this is a good book even though I enjoy reading other kinds of books (like science fiction.) However, what I found special about this one is that it is very realistic. The characters and the situations in the novel makes you feel this happened in real life. The book is about the summer romance between two teenagers: Brenda Patimkin (one rich girl) and Neil Klugman (a poor boy). Neil sees her for the first time swiming in a pool, and falls in love with her. After that, they begin to love each other romantically; but after awhile they start having problems with each other, which will make you wonder if they'll stay together as a couple (but that's for you to read.) I'd say it is an entertaining book; it has funny parts, sad parts, happy and romantic. I haven't read other Roth novels, but this one is very good written. If you enjoy realistic novels, then it's a good choice."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"In Goodbye Columbus, Philip Roth first displayed his subconcious mind-probing virtuosity and the anti-hero proto-character, which would both become trademarks of his. Packaged with five very worthwhile short stories, this book, despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, remains one of Roth's most endearing creations."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Though definitely not his best work, _Goodbye, Columbus_ is an impressive first effort from one of the best authors of the second half of this century. Throughout the book one can sense the style Roth was creating for himself, and though this book doesn't exhibit that breathless virtuosity of prose, that mastery of the English language, of his later books, it's still a nice read.The novella _Goodbye, Columbus_ is a love story and a quiet meditation on a different type of &quot;class struggle,&quot; and a better example of Roth's style -- not to mention a better story -- than his next two books, _Letting Go_ and _When She Was Good_. The first of the five stories, &quot;The Conversion of the Jews,&quot; is a bit sick, but entertaining for that very reason. The middle three stories are a bit lackluster, but the book ends in high style, with &quot;Eli, the Fanatic,&quot; a story that manages to be both a moving story about conflicting loyalties (the goyim or the Jews) and a hilarious portrait of a nervous breakdown.I would not recommend this book to those just starting to read Philip Roth (try the Zuckerman Bound trilogy instead), but for anyone wondering where Roth's career started, it's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"...that states that everyone should read this book. The title story is at once hilarious and heartbreaking. Roth is one of the most gifted writers America has produced, and this (his first book) proves it. I particularly admire Roth's ability to get the reader to sympathize and realate to characters they don't particularly like. It was a an unforgettable experience. Don't waste your time with the movie version though. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Goodbye Columbus is a book that shows reality about love. I really recommend it to everyone, specially the teenagers who want to learn a tough lesson about life. I think the deal with Neil and Brenda is that they were in love at some point of their lives but still their relationship was not so strong to handle a long distance relation, neither a problem with parents. Both were still immature, especially Brenda who could not take her own decisions because, as a little child, she was influenced by her parents, no matter what she felt. On the other side, Neil ran out of love so, at the end, he was not interested on fighting for their love. I believe that the idea of the story is sad but is still has some humorous parts that will make you enjoy the book at the same time it teaches you a lesson."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"It is an excelent story for everyone even young readers.

This is the story of a summer love, the protagonist, Neil Klugman is a kid who mets Brenda Patimkin, a girl of upper class that falls in love with him, but Neil is always making fun of her and her social class, sometimes being even mean to her. For this reason, the reader can never like him. The setting of the novel is great, but flaw is the protagonist and his attitude and that is not good, because when you begin to read the novel, the expectations are high, but in the end it dissapoints."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye, Columbus, but I did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion. thank you for the short stories...."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"&quot;Goodbye, Columbus,&quot; by Philip Roth, is a series of short stories. Each story has it's own characters and plot. Roth begins with a story about man and women who fall in love. They experience many conflicts such as family matters and working habits. The second story is about a boy who is trying to discover how Jesus was established as a religious icon. His misunderstanding leads to a crisis on top of a building. The third story is about World War II and a man's perception of the war and his experiences. The fourth story is about a husband and wife who are struggling with marriage conflicts. The wife believes her husband is cheating on her because he develops an extraordinary rash. The fifth story is about two boys who are in high school and are learning about baseball and true friendship. They develop a friendship that lasts a life time. The last story is about a man and his pregnant wife. They struggle with money and job issues, but somehow they learn to deal with their obstacles in life when approached by them.The short stories all have similar aspects to them. Roth uses very descriptive diction to project a vivid image into the reader's mind and to create a romantic tone in the story. The stories are easy to follow and understand because of the use of straight forward word choice and descriptions of the characters. The reader may find that the stories are short and unfinished, but because of this, the reader is left with suspense and imagination."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected.

Roth's style is easy to read and surprisingly humorous. The title story about a summer romance should hit home with a lot of people. I found the theme of love versus lust to be quite an interesting and realistic perspective. I think many of us could learn a valuable lesson here."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"This is Philip Roth's first acclaimed work, a novella about a Jewish twenty-something and the yearnings of young love, and five other short stories. Roth always touches on something completely exceptional by its normality, and tells a story in a gripping, intelligent and thoroughly honest manner. The title story is about a young man who out of youtful desire starts a passionate affair with a Jewish girl, knowing nothing about her or her family. He ingratiates himself into her life and family, while still remaining somewhat elusive and anonymous. He has no real family ties, with parents living thousands of miles away and an aunt in Newark whom he is trying to break away from. It is a fascinating story, providing yet another glimpse into Jewish identity and alienation, of which Roth is one of fiction's greatest exponents.The remaining stories are also outstanding; remarkably different from the title story, but each providing something of the present day (well, 1950's when the book was written) struggles with identity experienced by the post-WWII American Jew, ranging from a 13 year old boy undergoing training for his bar mitzvah and questioning issues of faith and tempting fate; to a Jewish military sargeant conflicted about how to fairly treat Jewish members of his military battalion.One can almost taste the honesty, it is so thick. That is what I love about Roth. He has no agenda other than the accurate descriptions of humanity, which in his experiences happen to be mostly Jewish, in all its failings, idiosyncrasies and conflict.I eagerly await the next installment in my Roth-provided education."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Roth at all, and when discussing him, I always seem to forget that he wrote these stories. It really does seem like the work of a different author; a brighter, more clever and inventive one; namely, younger. Maybe the mold of cynicism just set around him at a certain point as he aged, in which case Goodbye, Colombus stands as his first and last good work.First of all, the writing is first-rate modern American, a light but not overly breezy style, something like Bellow. Especially in the title story, the subtle humor is very effective, and he has a Salingerian gift for making the last sentence of a paragraph resonate. The themes, also, that continue throughout the stories are well-developed and intriguing; in 'Defender of the Faith,' he shows how a very convincing sociopath takes advantage of his Jewish identity and uses it as a weapon; in a story the title of which I can't remember, a young boy rebels against the oppressive Jewish instruction of his elders; then, later, in 'Eli the Fanatic,' Roth shows a man discovering solace in the stark rituals of traditional Judaism. The issue is examined from many angles. 'Epstein' is more suggestive of his later work and somehwat distasteful, very bleak, but a convincing portrait of an aging and frustrated Jewish man. 'You can't tell a man by the song he sings' is lighter and has little relation to the theme of Judaism, in case you were beginning to think Roth couldn't write about anything else.The title story is easily the best; the rest are just accesories. While the romance which it depicts never really seems justified (what does she see in him to begin with?), the writing is superlative and the characters interesting, and the semitragic conclusion more moving than it really should be. In this story, Roth displays a delicacy which is foremost among the things he inexplicably loses later on; he seems to like these characters, even the spoiled and decadent family, and stops to linger on minor details with a real zest for description.Reading these stories made me think I had judged Roth too quickly after reading only two of his books; I read another, and was disappointed again. Stick to this one."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"From the first quarter of the first story:The darker it got the more savagely did Brenda msh the net ...Though it w3s summer now nnd I was out of college three years, it w3s not hard for me ...The page he had been looking at showed an 81/212 x 11 print... twinkled in his boyish eves Poor little Tulie (eves should be eyes, no period, Tulie for Julie)yamdkah (not yamulkah)In the entire house I had'nt seen one picture of Mr. Patimkin.incongrosly (misspelled)Believe me, I could on like this all day -- there were hundreds of mistakes like these.

My battered paperback copy of this book accompanied me through my teenage years and early 20s -- helped tip the scales in favor of my choosing to become a writer for a living. The experience of reading this on the Kindle was such a disappointment that I really wonder how Amazon's not ashamed to ask readers for money for a defective product that's inferior to the one that was originally published 51 years ago. Terrible."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I find Philip Roth's debut novella, Goodbye, Columbus, to be much more enjoyable than his more famous work, Portnoy's Complaint. For one thing, Columbus is much shorter - it gets to the point. It is not endlessly repetitive, the way Portnoy is - nor is Roth as full of himself in this more modest work.Goodbye, Columbus has all the heart that Portnoy's Complaint lacks. It is the proverbial \\"coming of age\\" story of Neil Klugman. Neil is the Philip Roth stand-in - like Roth, he is a poor Jewish boy from Newark. He has his first great love affair with Brenda Patimkin - a rich girl from Short Hills. Brenda is all he could ever want in a woman, so everything should be perfect...right? The reader may guess at the stops along the way, but predictability isn't really the issue - it's the journey that matters.I found the short stories in this collection less appealing. They are all on the same theme: the aversion Roth feels towards Jewish-American culture, while being a Jewish-American. This is one of the central themes in his novels as well, but his short stories are not able to support this theme as well as the other diversions that make his novels enjoyable. As such, the short stories are one-trick-ponies, and I found them tiring. Perhaps this is the reason that Roth is known as a novelist and not a short-story writer. However, the book is worth purchasing for the novella alone."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"After I recently heard a piece about Roth on the radio I decided to learn more about him and read one of his books. After looking at the long listing of works he's written and literary awards won, it seemed easiest to just go with the first book he wrote, of which it's been said is a 'masterpiece'.Having written this first book while still in his 20s, it may be safe to presume he was at the latter end of his formative years. Therefore, it seems this book of short(er) stories must be strongly reflective of Roth's Jewish upbringing, as nearly each story is centered in some fashion around the Northern New Jersey Jewish community of the 1950s. Yet, despite that seemingly narrow setting and context, each of the stories is unique in its own right. Nearly every story presents to the reader a conflict of some type, be it in love, family, religion, community, self, morality, ethics, or something else along those lines. These are not intense stories of suspense or mystery which keep the (or this) reader turning the pages with anticipation, but the conflict presented in each story coupled with what I think is excellent overall style and great characters make for good reading.So, while in the end I wasn't enthralled with this book quite enough to give it five stars, I must say that I so much enjoyed Roth's style that I definitely will take a closer look at his other works, find some that look like good stories, and read him again."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Reminded me a bit of 'Sterile Cuckoo'. College romance - beset with the fumblings of young adults. An enjoyable story with an almost predictable letdown. The letdown was expected, so it wasn't a bummer.The other stories varied from pretty good to okay.The last story was strange, but it was not a show stopper. Roth is a good writer."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I found the novela interesting, but dated. Of course it would have been wonderfully scandalous at the time it was written. Many men today have become less insistent on women taking a lead in birth control.

This is a period piece that must be read as a historical novela."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"went on a long plane ride, the book was a delight to read and made the travel much happier.

It's usually easy to work out what the word should have been, but it's very distracting and breaks the flow of the text."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I reread Goodbye Columbus, which I had read in 1970! This was Philip Roth's first novel, starting off his long (and continuing to this day) career of quirky, bold, controversial novels. Goodbye Columbus was really a novella, and somewhat autobiographical (in time and place at least). It isn't a book for everyone, but I loved it! Neil Krugman, lower middle class Jewish young man, living in Newark with his old school aunt and uncle in the late 1950's meets Brenda Patimpkin, original Jewish American Princess (before the term was used, but clearly at a time when the newly wealthy Jews were leaving the Jewish \\"ghetto's\\" of NY and Newark and heading to Short Hills, Milburn and Livingston, NJ, where even today they live in material splendor. Brenda and her parents, brother and little sister Julie (quite a brat) live in Short Hills where with their surgically altered little noses, they are fed lovely meals by their housekeeper, Carlotta, and they play tennis and swim at their ritzy club which is where Brenda and Neil meet one day when she is home from Radcliffe for summer vacation. She asks him to hold her glasses. He does, and from there a romance builds. Neil spends many weeks at the Patimpkin home, staying there for a 2 week vacation and spending his nights sneaking across the hall into the waiting Brenda's arms. This was risque in 1957. It happened, of course, but it wasn't talked about and people were far more furtive than Brenda and Neil. He encourages her to be fitted for a diaphragm and she is horrified. And here is where, only people of a certain age would know the reference to Margaret Sanger, Neil advises Brenda to go to the Margaret Sanger offices in NYC. I only knew what it was because I remember my Grandmother telling me that when she was a young married woman no one but married women could get such birth control, but that Margaret Sanger had an institute where wealthy married women could go for birth control! Most people reading this novel would not know this. Funny the things a book can bring back to your memory 40+ years after a conversation with a beloved, long dead grandmother! Brenda heads to NYC but feels she must pretend to be married!!!! There is a delightful scene as she exits the Margaret Sanger office, a scene which played out in my head in Ali McGraw's voice as I remembered her so well from the movie based on the book, a movie I saw at age 15 while traveling with a theatre camp. (I would NOT want a 15 yr. old to see the movie, rated R, even now!)Roth's observations are keen. When he heads back to his home in Newark to see his aunt and uncle he wonders about the city, which had been so fine at one time. Jews with money left, the town was being filled with black people en masse, and he ponders whether, they too, will flee one day, but he concludes that no, he cannot imagine any other group filling it's streets. I found that so interesting as I look at Newark's demographics today. Roth, via Neil Klugman, is mocking the identity loss of ethnic Jews, fixing bent noses, living in over abundant splendor and looking down on the middle class, even the Jewish middle class. Even today we see people like this in their McMansions (doesn't matter their ethnicity or religion). These are the people who drive flashy cars and have to make known their wealth, even though no one is really impressed except themselves.The romance of Brenda and Neil has it's twists and roadblocks. In the end there is a controversy I have never forgotten, but won't ruin for you. Did she or did she NOT do the thing she did on purpose? People discussed this for years (in schools, among friends, and after the movie). It's SUCH a good question!!!!!Roth was only 25 when he penned this brilliant first novel. His observations are so astute for one so young. His writing is spare (unlike mine!) and allows the reader to easily envision his story playing out before his eyes. My daughter has chosen to read Goodbye Columbus for an honors research paper (jr. year in h.s.) and I am concerned that it is too sexy for her. As a teenager, I loved it, but as a mother I am freaking out! I am glad I will be able to explain to her the way society was in the late 50's, just beginning to let go of repression and allowing the sexual revolution and the free love of the 60's to become the new way of life for so many. I will be able to explain the reference to Margaret Sanger. She has been to Short Hills, so she will have some reference in her mind as to where the Patimpkin's lived and played their beautiful-on-the-outside but disfunctional lives.Philip Roth is one of the greats! He will be read for generations to come, liek Fitgerald and Hemingway. Perhaps he will be remembered for being one of the first to write about birth control in a novel.I am trying to get my hands on a copy of the dvd, but unless I am willing to pay $80, there are none. Richard Benjamin and Ali McGraw were so perfectly cast! The music plays in my head, their youth and charm flash across the screen. Rereading the book was a delight!!!!!"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I read this in college many years ago and came back to it to see if held the old magic. I am happy to say that it does. Roth captures so much of modern suburban life, circa mid-century - the flight from the city to the suburbs, the angst of young love, and finding the authentic identity, in a warm and humorous way that stands the test of time. Goodbye Columbus is a rare book that is nearly word-perfect,"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"This was the first volume I read by Philip Roth, and for now the only one, and I have to say I was not as impressed as I had been led to believe. Don't get me wrong, it was by no means bad, but it didn't blow my mind. The subject of the title story didn't interest me too much, it was the style that kept me going and I eventually liked it (the first pages failed to capture my interest).I liked the short stories better, for the most part.When it comes to East Coast Jewish authors, I far prefer JD Salinger over Philip Roth (although I prefer Salinger over almost every author there is). I'll say it's an interesting insight into the Jewish community although not to the extent that it becomes some anthropoligical volume.I was just nonplussed, mostly. It's always a difficult thing to be nonplussed by renouned classics that everyone seems to love and worship.Goodbye, Columbus is an efficiently written, witty, and insightful volume, although, to me, it doesn't have the magic that I would expect from a classic. For this reason, I'm very unsure that I'll ever read another Roth book again (and that's not because I disliked Roth \\"so much\\", but simply because I have tons on my reading list already), although if you feel like suggesting another, better, book by this author, I'm all ears."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"A fun re-read. Love the ethnicity! This book struck more of a cord as an older reader--well out of high school when it was yet another required dirge...much more enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"No doubt that Philip Roth is one of our most talented and courageous writers. Too bad this Kindle Edition is so riddled with typos that they distract from the power of the prose."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I first read \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" years ago and recently decided to read it again to see if it holds up. It absolutely does. The story still resonates, the characters are just as real and identifiable as they were when the book was written. Clearly, it's a classic."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"In an effort to read less junk, I have been picking up more contemporary literature. This book was one more step in the right direction.Philip Roth is one of America's most prolific and lauded contemporary authors, and most of his work is considered to be semi-autobiographical.This book, his first work, contains the novella, \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" and five much shorter stories.In this collection, all of his protagonists are Jewish males. And, like nearly all of his works, the stories take place in New Jersey.\\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is the story of a young man who is attracted to a red-headed athletic young woman that he sees at a country club. He pursues Brenda with the persistency of a man who has the confidence to have a beautiful woman but with the sarcastic tone that belies the chip on his shoulder for not quite measuring up.He sees everything with a smirk; his tone is belittling and condescending to cover his sense of not belonging in Brenda's suburban Jewish life.I am re-reading it again just to learn how Roth wrote that smirk.The other five stories are good. Almost like fables, my favorite one, \\"Conversion of the Jews\\", is startlingly profound, calling to mind questions I think that most of us have subliminally thought but were never able to say.If you are interested in dipping your toe into some more \\"literary\\" work, this book is extremely easy to read and I found the stories to be quite moving."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I bought this book for school but had previously viewed the movie. I was pleased with the relatable narrative. This is a great coming of age story in the restrictive pre-women's rights era."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Philip Roth shows early glimpses of his brilliance in this collection of short stories. For Roth fans, the real treat here is seeing the author's work as a young man. If you are like me and have read all of his books from the 1990s, you probably have an image in your mind of an author in his 60s. His writing always comes across as somewhat autobiographical, and most of the main characters in his books over the past ten years have been Jewish men entering their golden years. Because of this, I was a bit surprised to read a book of his in which the main characters are almost all young Jewish men. This just reinforces the notion that Roth has always tried to stick with what he knows, and that his writing stems more from his experience than from his creativity. In my mind he's the best writer out there."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"I like to read relationship-ey novels, and I was thinking that this relationship-ey novella would be a high end take on the impossibility of love, etc (plus I've been told good things about it). And that I'd feel classy after reading it. I do feel classy after reading it. It's a really excellent bunch of set pieces on a young summer romance. Roth does a great caricature: Brenda's worldly father, less-successful uncle, and Neil's crazy aunt are all very memorable and concisely drawn. And he does really precise scenes: it's kind of swimming pool, dinner, doctor, wedding, and we're done.But since Roth's writing really economically and less evaluatively, the main characters were less clear. Brenda, the romantic object, gets some witty lines, but is otherwise treated semi-unfairly. It's really unclear, in the light of this century, how a fight over a contraceptive would be so important for a couple having plenty of sex - a fight where Brenda's implausibly portrayed as both self-hating and pretty sneaky. And Neil as unbearably arrogant. And why'd she like the paranoid, chip-on-his-shoulder, but also smugly superior kid-from-the-other-side-of-the-tracks? Also unclear - since Neil works in a library, it wasn't like he was rough trade or anything.So it's very good in the particulars, but there's a hole in the center of this thing. I liked the Ghostwriter - an absolutely perfect novella - even better."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Philip Roth is a great writer. Yeah, we've all heard this at one point or another (at least those of you taking and wasting time to read a review of one of his books). This was Mr. Roth's first published work, a short novel and five short stories that forced us to realize this man had arrived violently on the scene as a powerful literary force. Let's talk about the stories in this collection:&quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; is, honestly, without the standard hyperbole so many people slab into reviews such as this, one of the best novels I have ever read. It was written by a twenty-five year old man who was only going to get better (as his work from the mid-1980s to the present firmly establishes) yet here we have the wisdom of our great American gods. It is a beautiful story, funny and painful and filled with truths anyone in those recent post-college, still-not-finding-one's self perspective could learn and grow from. I love this story, and it is filled with agonizing self-analytical material that shows who it is we are dealing with, the intellect and the passion, the savagry and the wit. There are not too many single stories of American authors I could recommend more highly than this book, in particular the five page sequence from which this story gets its title. It is haunting and true, one of the rare glories of English in narrative form. If for nothing else, get this book to read this lovely novella. It is, profoundly, a masterpiece (not a term I use lightly either, being the bitter cynic I am--check out other reviews I've written--I can get rather mean)&gt;Among the other stories, the most celebrated is &quot;Conversion of the Jews&quot;, and for good reason. This is another gorgeously written tale about self-discovery and the agony of those questions all beginning with 'Why?' Here is a story questioning faith, questioning the idea of God or a higher power that has been transformed into such a makeshift mythology by all the varying faiths, why bother, it asks, what is the point and is it real and who are we and why are we here and why why why why why? This is a great story.Sadly, this collection is begun with the two tales I have so widely praised. The remaining stories are good--very good, in fact, but following up &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and &quot;Conversion of the Jews&quot;, something is lost as they are unable (quite understandably--what 25 year old author is going to maintain such sustained greatness? It took Roth 27 years to return to this passion in &quot;The Counterlife&quot;, and then he expanded from there, getting better and better progressively, and never looking back)to keep up the fascination. Now this is not to say there is anything wrong with these other stories. Had they been all there was in this collection I would have looked back with nodding approval and said, &quot;Hey, this guy is going somewhere.&quot; But they are not the first two stories and are almost awkwardly placed as an aftermath of a developing great author. Get this book urgently, and read them all. Just don't allow yourself to be soured by the slightly lesser material following the first two masterworks."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Goodbye, Columbus is a coming of age story, a summer romance between a poor boy and a wealthy girl. Many themes that were to show up in much more detail in his later works are presented in embryonic form in this novella, his first major work. Being Jewish in America, sex, class boundaries, the American Way: All Roth subjects, all handled with intelligence and compassion.Neil is the typical poor Jewish boy enamoured with Brenda, the classy, self-assured, rich girl. He shows a rare spark of confidence when he calls her for a date after first meeting her at a swimming pool, when she accepts and they meet, he finds that he really doesn't know what to do from there. But, they bumble through the beginnings of a relationship, mutually attracted physically, diametrically opposed socially. Neil has a few 'poor' ideas and thoughts that Brenda cannot relate to, while she accepts such luxuries as a maid or 'getting her nose fixed' with such ease and complacency that we - and Neil - are amazed. Over the summer, their relationship develops further, with the typical ups and downs of love colouring the journey.Neil is the 'I' character of the story, and it is through his point of view that we watch the story unfold. However, even though the story is in first person, there is never much of his personality revealed through contemplative thought or reflection. Instead, we learn who he is from the way he interacts with Brenda and others, and from the way he studies the events in which he is involved. By the end of the novella, we (mostly) understand his motives and ideas, and though, admittedly, it is a little difficult to imagine Neil existing outside the scope of the novel, that actually plays into the theme of the story. Neil is searching for meaning, for a reason to keep on existing, and he considers that in Brenda, he has found it. Whether this is true or not becomes a large focus in the novel, particularly when, later on, she repeatedly reveals to him that she is in fact her own person, with her own ideas, and that sometimes they won't mesh with his.Brenda, on the other hand, remains a complete mystery to both the reader and Neil. Because we are never allowed to see her thoughts, and because her and Neil have such a different social background, she is someone who we try to understand, but inevitably fail. At times, Neil will say or do something and she will become upset, or tender, or both, and Neil will be so confused that he simply accepts. This can be frustrating for the reader, because Brenda is an appealing character, and it would be nice for him to have the gumption to search deeper within her for meaning and thought, but unfortunately he rarely does. Interestingly, this doesn't come off so much as a failing on Roth's part as an author, but Neil's as a character.As stated above, the typical themes and ideas that Roth was to develop more fully in his later works are present here. There is the same easy insight into the mundane reality of life, and the same simple joy in, say, eating a piece of fruit or swimming in a pool. Goodbye, Columbus is a story that focuses on one single idea, that being the summer romance between two people that could not have a relationship in any other situation, and it explores it in a remarkably fulfilling way. Admittedly, the very Jewish quality of the writing and ideas may not be as identifiable for a non-Jewish person, but speaking as a man of no faith, I didn't find it to be all that much of a problem. Also, the casual racism towards African-Americans may be off-putting, but again, it didn't upset the flow of the novel.To conclude, what Roth has done here is to introduce himself as an author, and for a twenty-six year old, it is an impressive introduction. Having read other works of his, I would recommend it as a good starting point. If you like Goodbye, Columbus - and I am quite certain everyone would - then you will love his later works. If not, not. And at only 140 pages, it is worth everyone's time to check out."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Goodbye, Columbus is the story of Neil Klugman from poor Newark and Brenda Patimkin from an upper-crust family in Short Hills and their relationship over a summer. Neil relates the story of his love for the beautiful Brenda, a love in which the two share little in common. He presents his hopes and dreams and his ultimate realizations about the state of the world and about himself. The novella is ultimately a beautiful, complex coming-of-age story which it seems everyone goes through.Goodbye, Columbus is one of the best books I have read. It was so realistic and easy to relate to. I think that I have had a relationship similar to every one related in the novel. There are so many great insights to be found here. The novella isn't a difficult read, but one should definitely be aware of a lot of the symbols (such as the title, the fruit, the lions, and the uncle at the wedding) to glean the most from it. I will also say a word about the short stories. All of them, particularly &quot;The Conversion of the Jews,&quot; were wonderful. They alone would make the book worth five stars; they just seem to get forgotten because of the masterpiece the opening novella is."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"In Goodbye, Columbus, Philip Roth weaves a tale about the assimilation of the American Jew which reached its height in the 1950's. As outward displays of anti-semitism began to decrease, the Jewish community faced a moral crisis. How much of our heritage need we or should we retain in this &quot;golden land&quot;.The message of Philip Roth in all of his works, but especially his inaugural one, is that American Jews have payed a price for acceptance. They have traded in their ghetto mentality for a ticket to the American Dream. While many would welcome such a transformation, Roth unabashedly condemns it.In the character of Brenda Patimkin, we are presented with the archtypical &quot;Jewish American Princess&quot; materialistic yet vulnerable. Neil Klugman is exactly the opposite, the symbol of the &quot;old-world&quot; Jew who lives with his Aunt and Uncle in the city. Despite their differences Brenda and Neil eventually fall in love only to discover that their inner attitudes are the diametric opposites to their outward characteristics. It is Brenda who is concerned in a old fashioned sense about what her parents think of her pre-marital affair.In Goodbye, Columbus Roth describes the foibles and makeup of the Jewish American community which, like Newark, was coming apart at the seams in the middle of the twentieth century.H.Brookman-Elizabeth, New Jersey"},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"The first five chapters of Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus follow his protagonist Neil Klugman through a romanticized post college summer. Roth introduces this straightforward prose with a sentence that does not waste anytime, \\"The first time I saw Brenda\\"(p 3). This sentence draws the reader quickly into a book that does not spend pages on exposition, rather Roth starts out with action and fills in any gaps as they arise. This writing style is beautiful to read, and perfectly matches the quick, to the point feeling of a summertime romance. The story, like the prose, is not over packed. It begins, as stated, with the first time Neil meets Brenda Patimkin. The feeling of young love jumps off the first page, when Neil watches Brenda walk away, \\"She caught the bottom of her suit between thumb and index finger and flicked what flesh had been showing back where it belonged. My blood jumped\\" (p 3). And the reader, along with Neil, is hooked on Brenda from the beginning. Roth is careful to make the feelings in the book apparent, from the first we feel as though we are about to embark on a summer of relaxation and love. But Roth's love is not married couple adult love; it is love like the cashier in Updike's A &amp;P. It is love at first sight. It is pretty girl by the pool kind of love. This feeling of Neil's love for Brenda is only made stronger by Roth's evocation of summer. The dominant feeling in the book though, is lust. Neil begins his relationship with Brenda after watching her at the pool, and after that he is always bringing sex to the foreground of he book. The description of Neil and Brenda's escapade in the pool shows Neil's youthful obsession with the female body, \\"Her breasts swam towards me like two pink-nosed fish and she let me hold them\\"(p 17). It does not end there; after he ate dinner with Brenda's family he sat at his desk in the library and, \\"watched the hot high-breasted teen-age girls walk twitchingly up the wide flight of marble stairs\\"(p 32). And he describes his lust for other women as \\"academic and time passing\\" showing that may not feel anything towards the girls that walk by him, but that should not stop him from thinking about them (p 32). The constant remembrance of sex in the novel is the most effective method Roth uses of getting his mood across. Without it the spirit of summer, young love, and adventure would be gone. Neil and Brenda's relationship would be dull and flat; the afternoons at the library would be spent solely on thinking about work, and story would be deflated. Roth did not, however, write an erotic book that talks only about sex. He does recognize what a key role sex, lust, and love play in the lives of his twenty-year-old characters. He uses it as a framework for which to place the deeper, less common story."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"The book's brilliant.Here's one thing that's not in the book that perhaps sheds some light on understanding the title: Across the street from the Newark Library, where the lead character works, is a park containing a statue of Christopher Columbus.After reading this book many years ago, I was puzzled by the title. The \\"Columbus record\\" scenes to which the title refers did not seem as climactic and important to be highlighted. The Columbus record belongs to a second tier character, and yes, while the scene undergirds themes of coming of age and loss, the scene just didn't seem to be that important. But when you tie that coming-of-age theme to the statue of the explorer across from the lead character's workplace, where Neil no doubt ate lunch regularly, then you realize that Goodbye, Columbus, is Philip Roth's Goodbye to Berlin.(I refer especially to the last scene in Berlin, in which all the characters in Isherwood's novel are having a picnic...no big deal, until you realize they are Jews and homosexuals and intellectuals and everyone else who, if they fail to get out, will be doomed shortly by the Third Reich. And all of it is left unsaid, the history is left to comment on the work on its own.)In Columbus, the stakes are lower but analogous. The lead character is going to leave Newark ... he still works there, but he's going to say goodbye to that statue across the street, by extention the city. It's all unsaid but after the lead character gets out of Newark, the construction of I-78 will mean the beautiful neighborhood where Neil and his family lived will be torn apart; after that, Newark faces a particularly corrupt administration that starts the flight of businesses and sets the stage for the three days of devastating riots in 1967 (the ruins of which stood for more than 20 years) and the flight of half the population from the city.Goodbye to Columbus was written while the forces that destroyed Newark were inchoate, but it only means that in this case, Roth was prescient."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Philip Roth obviously doesn't believe in stretching his imagination too much - the main story here and most of the supporting shorter stories revolve around Jewish boys growing up around Newark, New Jersey. His real strength however lies in his ability to take these characters and describe and examine what makes them tick, and imbue them with just enough personal identity to distinguish them from each other and allow them to sink into our consciousness.\\"Goodbye Columbus\\" the story is a touching tale of a summer romance between two individuals from very different social circles. There isn't much plot, not very much happens and the moral dilemma that ultimately shapes the fate of the relationship is a bit hard to relate to in these promiscuous times. Roth doesn't spend much time on that aspect of the plot, presuming perhaps that his contemporary reader would be only too familiar with the portrayed dilemma. Reading it at the start of the 21st century I feel unable to fully empathize with the protagonists' situation. However the prose is well observed, the situations and dialogue are witty and amusing and although the ending is a bit weak, I feel the beauty of the writing transcends generational barriers.The short stories are more pointed, and pithier, and perhaps make for better reading. As in Roth's other work, the characters are mostly very Jewish, and many revolve around particularly Jewish themes, feelings and situations. However I still found myself well able to identify with the narrators, despite being handicapped by my obvious goyishness."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"The great brilliance and talent of Philip Roth announce themselves to the world in this first book. Much of what Roth would be later admired for is present in this work. A remarkable capacity for creating memorable characters, a tremendous liveliness and humor in language, a somewhat sarcastic view of American reality mixed up with a deeply romantic and idealistic one, fervent sexual interest. There is also in these works the kind of criticism of his home- team, the American Jewish family which would make him anathema to certain leading figures of the Jewish literary ( Irving Howe) and cultural establishment. The major piece of writing , the novella ' Goodbye Columbus' seems like it is the heir apparent to ' The Great Gatsby'. There is a mastery of tone , precociously mature. That tone and that control will lead to the less successful line in Roth's writing, in which the narrator ( When She was Good) and the writer appear to be seeking entrance to the cathedral of Jamesian Anglo- American literature. This novella has many skilled and interesting pieces of writing excellently evokes the world of Jewish American suburbia its business and family worlds. The love affair between Neil and Brenda Patinkin has a certain unsatisfactory quality especially in his ungenerous portrait of Brenda. The scene with the little black boy in the library fascinated by the works of Gaugin may be sentimental but is quite moving. As for the stories they too have a brilliance, and they also have that criticism of middle - class Jewish piety which Roth will be lambasted for .These are very good pieces of writing and would stand well on their own. But when Roth wrote ' Portnoy's Complaint ' he changed the way his previous work would be seen .And all would be understand as simply preliminary to that outrageous work of true literary genius. This is a fine book, but that is a great one."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Sadly, the kindle edition is replete with typos - seemingly from an un-proofread OCR translation. A truly great book, but completely unreadable. Too bad Roth's publisher isn't available on the itunes store..."},{"Title":"Goodbye Columbus","review":"Not many writers had such a great debut as Philip Roth with his \`Goodbye, Columbus'. His harshest critics may say he has had ups and downs in his career, but no one can say that his first book is not superb --even those who don't like it. Crafting with a short novella, Roth was able to display all his qualities that he would develop later on with his books.\`Columbus' is nothing more than the simple story of a summertime love. A Jewish boy named Neil meets a girl, who belongs to an upper level in society, they fall in love, and, above everything, have to deal with their social difference. But the way Roth writer is so simply profound and beautiful, that it is impossible no to be touched by this little masterpiece.The characters are so well developed, that the more one reads the more compelling the story becomes. Not failing to mention such a fresh sense of humor that makes this novella very funny. This same quality appears in the other five short stories gathered in this Vintage edition.One may complain that Roth has not much creativity, writing about only one subject: the young Jewish man in the late 50's. But that is not really true. His stories are similar not because of the lack of imagination, but because the writer cares to focus his attention in this subject. And, although, it seems a limited issue at first, with his words it becomes easily universal, because above all the stories concern on the human condition.Among the stories, it is possible to find one the finest Roth's short texts: \`Defender of the faith'. The surreality of the proximity of the war and the dispute between the two main characters somehow reminds the tour de force present in the movies made by Amos Gitai. The absurd of the situation, and the characters focusing on another --maybe smaller-- issue are funny, when we don't think of the imminent situation.One doesn't have to look any further to find hints of the themes and characters that would be present in further works. The daughter in \`Epstein' is somehow a draft of the daughter who would appear much more developed in his novel \`American Pastoral'.All in all, \`Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories' is a good introduction for those curious to get into Roth's universe, and, it is a fundamental reading for the ones who like his books."},{"Title":"Social History of the Tamils (1707-1947)","review":"Mr. Subramanian has certianly given us a lot to go on in this sweeping survey of every major aspect--economic to religious--of Tamil life over a 240 year span of colonial rule in India (he sadly neglects Sri Lankan Tamils). It is full of facts and observances, and Subramanian has done an excellent job in his attempt to paint a complete portrait of Tamil life. Unfortunately, by the nature of its very scope, it fails to investigate any aspect with real depth. The reader comes away with having a sense of the richness, scope, and pitifulness of this era of Tamil history, but really little more than a disjointed sketch.I feel this history serves as an excellent primer to Tamil history, and certianly introduces the reader to the major players of Tamil history and major events affecting the Tamils during that time, and some of the details he provides from his extensive research are fascinating. I found his chapter on economics to be most painstakeningly researched and of fascination to anyone interested in colonial India. I found his chapters on religion and lifestyles less intriguing, perhaps because of the difference in the level of detail desired by the reader and the level of detail provided by the author."},{"Title":"Tunnel through time","review":"It was the early 80s and I was in the library in Woodbridge Middle School. I found a hardcover book that seemed interesting. A time travel story. Being into science fiction I, of course, checked it out. I enjoyed it so much that I remembered it till this day. In fact, I had to order it when I found it on Amazon. Of course I had forgotten the title, the author, almost everything but was lucky to find a site on prehistoric fiction. But lets move onto the plot.Yes, the plot is simple - in those days sending teens back in time was the norm. Teenagers in sci-fi fought aliens, destroyed monsters and saved the world all the time. Sometimes more than once.Sadly, the science, mostly with early life, is outdated. Well, duh, it was first printed in 1966. Of course the dinosaurs and their behavior is all wrong.

I've now purchased it for my kids!"},{"Title":"Tunnel through time","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***One measurement of a book's appeal is the memories it can still evoke even after years go by. I haven't read \\"Tunnel Through Time\\" since I was a pre-teen, but I remember much of the story well and how much it excited and captivated me. The plot is straightforward. High school senior Bob's father is a physicist who can create time portals to various ancient periods. Bob's father more or less ignores him, but basically because he is too enrapted in his work to pay much attention to his son. Furthermore, it is implied, while he isn't exactly a dummy, Bob is essentially a football jock type with little science proclivities. Nevertheless, Bob's best friend is Pete, who IS a studious, scientific type who is on the verge of but does not quite spill over into nerddom. Pete's father, a friend of Bob's father and a paleontologist, has ventured into the past via the time tunnel and has become lost. Amazingly, Bob's father recruits his son and Pete to go back in time through various portals to locate him.Time hopping ensues. Bob and Pete first visit the Cretaceous period and encounter a gigantic, vicious sea-living snake and witness a legendary battle between a Tyrannosaur and a Triceratops. Then they move forward to the Ice Age of roughly 20,000 years ago, plunge into a brutal blizzard, take shelter in a cave, see a woolly mammoth (or at least a trunk), and fall asleep with the mammoth blocking the cave entrance to seek shelter as well.The next day, the mammoth is gone, but Pete's father (aka \\"Doc Tom\\") finds them and barely saves them from freezng to death. Together, they go even more forward in time to the Pleistocene era, where they see and kill an attacking Smilodon (saber-toothed cat) and Megatherium (giant ground sloth) and are captured by a primitive tribe (Neanderthal or Cro-Magnon, the story does not say). The trio make friends with a pre-teen cave girl whom they christen Gina. At any event, another tunnel brings the trio to the present and back to Bob's father's lab, but Gina accidentally comes with them. However, she sees a delivery truck coming up the driveway, and, thinking it's some kind of monster, flees and jumps back into the time tunnel. Bob's father, Doc Tom, Bob, and Pete can only hope she makes it back to her time...As other posters have noted, \\"Tunnel Through Time\\" contains some paleontological inaccuracies, such as having a Jurassic period Brontosaurus (Apatosaurus) living contemporaneously with T-rex and Triceratops (Trice). Also, while exciting and gripping, the T-Rex/Trice battle is by now an archaic cliche. Also, the \\"sea\\" snake is unidentified, as are the primitive humans. At least the mammoth, Smilodon, and Megatherium are rendered realistically. Nonetheless, the story moves at a brisk and intelligent pace, and all the characters are sympathetic, cooperative, competent, and able, even if slightly stereotypical. Despite some anachronistic shortcomings, which were the product of the scope of 1966 knowledge, I would highly recommend this time travel tale for smart, inquisitive kids, with its exploration of incisive friendships, prehistory, and science in general."},{"Title":"Tunnel through time","review":"I first read this book while in elementary school and still have it in my library.

Dinosaurs whose only behavior is maniacal attack, even in the case of some herbovores. Prehistoric men who operate pretty much on the same level - savages just gotta be savage, after all. A paleontologist who travels back to the time of the dinosaur and collects no data - mostly just shoots things. Only one female character, who is mostly only happy when she does something to please the male heros. People who make bizarre choices apparantly only because the plot needs them to. No character development, clumsy writing, sloppy editting.Actually, Lester Del Rey didn't even write this. Someone else wrote it to his outline.There was good science fiction written in 1966, but is probably a example of why science fiction used to have such a crummy reputation."},{"Title":"Tunnel through time","review":"I have spent the last year researching the title of this book alone.

The Christian Ambonese became a pillar of colonial rule after earlier harsh policies (notably the spice monopoly) towards all Moluccans had been changed for preferential treatment of Christians in education and military service in the 19th century.Also interesting is the description of the era of Japanese occupation during the 2nd World War, when the Indonesian nationalists and Muslims were favoured.Finally, the period leading to RMS and eventually Indonesian rule is examined in great detail.The first, introductory chapter gives a good picture of traditional Ambonese social structure, and describes earlier history of these islands - unfortunately very briefly.Easily the most detailed historical treatment of these islands - and a very thoroughly-researched, objectively presented one at that. It is also useful as background reading to understanding some of the underlying causes/factors of the horrible sectarian violance that devastated these islands in 1999-2002.Unfortunately, like all the best books on the history of Maluku, this one is also out of print and hard to find now."},{"Title":"MCSE Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Database Design and Implementation Readiness Review; Exam 7 (MCSE Readiness Review)","review":"For those folks already familiar with SQL Server, this book will fill-in any obvious knowledge gaps when preparing for the exam. It's like the related MSCE Training Kits in that it covers all the required topics, but with less detailed discussions and lab practices. It also costs less and demands less study time to complete.If you don't know SQL Server and T-SQL quite well this book will not help you pass the 70-229 exam.

The reader is encouraged to think theoretically about the general structure of the database, but is given no specifics. Yet specifics are exactly what the later chapters require! If the reader follows the directions, it will become necessary to make numerous structure changes later.Worse yet, the \\"correct\\" database is not included on the CD, nor is it available online.

I quickly found that as much as I love to read about volcanoes and plate tectonics, I also have to learn some basics about rocks and minerals. I found this little book to be a great companion to my geology text book. It is not at all overwhelming - as many of the books written for adults tend to be. It is one of those great kids' books that should not be overlooked by an adult who doesn't want a 300-page tome on that quickly becomes \\"greek\\", but wants to get some genuine understanding of a complex new subject.For example, after a vacation to Joshua Tree I found myself puzzling over exactly what gneiss is. Every description I read seemed very confusing. This little book did a beautiful job describing exactly what gneiss is and how it is formed complete with great illustrations. If you are an adult who wants to learn something about rocks and minerals and you haven't a clue, my advice is head to this kids' book first. You may find yourself reading it cover to cover like I did."},{"Title":"Rocks and Minerals (National Audubon Society First Field Guides)","review":"This was a great deal for a great book!!!!

The last feminist, Le Doeuff, whose works did not mark the Anglo-American feminist universe as much as Irigaray's or Kristeva's, is included by Grosz in order to complete a literary/textual analysis of difference with a grounding into the history of philosophy and its feminist challenges. Informed by a discontent with the logic of identity, all three French feminists graft their ideas on a background inscribed by the Nietzschean logic of difference, Marxist materialism, Freudian psychoanalysis, Foucauldian genealogy, and Derridean deconstruction. From Kristeva's speaking subject and its propensity for discursive subversion and Irigaray's difference and criticism of logo(phallo)centrism, to Le Doeuff's search for the feminine in the history of philosophy and its &quot;imaginary&quot; (184), Grosz perceptively presents the main tenets of each of the three French feminists, their &quot;antihumanism, antiessentialism, and difference&quot; (xi). Sexual Subversions is a precious feminist inquiry into the place of French difference feminism(s) within Anglo-American traditions of liberal, Marxist, and radical feminisms. Can be read in conjunction with Nancy Fraser and Sandra Lee Bartky, eds., Revaluing French Feminism: Critical Essays on Difference, Agency, and Culture."},{"Title":"The Six Sigma Way: How GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies are Honing Their Performance","review":"I am a former GE Capital Black Belt and now Master Black Belt with experience at various companies in the process of implementing Six-Sigma Quality initiatives. I can tell you that I consider &quot;The Six Sigma Way&quot; by Pande et al as required reading for anyone who is even considering implementing or participating in a Quality program of this type. Whether you are an aspiring Black Belt or a seasoned member of the Senior Leadership Team, you'll find a lot of good ideas and advice on proactive Quality in this book.&quot;The Six Sigma Way&quot; introduces these state-of-the-art tools and concepts in plain...and often entertaining...English (for the rest of us), as opposed to the other books I've read that are dry and full of high-level concepts and statistical formulas that are far too advanced for most initial Six Sigma efforts anyway. The book provides an easy-to-follow roadmap for setting the proper foundation of a Six Sigma program and for obtaining buy-in and support from co-workers and business leaders. You can pick and choose whichever higher-level tools and techniques your business needs once you have established this critical (and often neglected) foundation.The book also promotes one of the more important aspects of the Six Sigma methodology that others seem to miss...that there is no single way of doing it! The authors recognize that every business environment is not the same, and that different aspects and techniques will appeal to different business cultures. One of this book's best features is that it very clearly spells out the principles involved with Six Sigma and then offers some practical ideas on how they can be successfully applied to a strategy for your specific business.The authors also provide clear examples of what works and what doesn't. They include &quot;case study&quot; examples that are actually entertaining to read and that are likely to be encountered in today's business environment. At the same time, they have carefully contrasted the successes of Six Sigma to the TQM movement that preceded it. Instead of simply saying &quot;TQM, bad...Six Sigma, good,&quot; as others have, the authors eloquently point out why certain aspects of TQM didn't work consistently. They go on to explain exactly what it is that Six Sigma does differently so that gains can be maintained for the long-term.Finally, I have to mention something about how the book addresses the use of statistics in Six Sigma type initiatives. All too often, business managers operating in a high-paced environment hear the words &quot;statistical process control&quot; and they are immediately turned-off...believing that a statistical approach to business management is too time consuming, unresponsive, and probably beyond their math capabilities anyway. &quot;The Six Sigma Way&quot; helps lay this ambiguity and fear of statistics to rest by explaining the key concepts in ways that don't require a degree in math. They focus on the basic measurement and analysis techniques that can actually be used and understood by managers at all levels, and the authors communicate this in a way that can be followed by anyone who can balance a checkbook.&quot;The Six Sigma Way&quot; is a wonderful guide to understanding proactive Quality programs; to designing and implementing a program for your specific business; and to maintaining that program over time. I am certain that you will find this book on every successful manager's reading list."},{"Title":"The Six Sigma Way: How GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies are Honing Their Performance","review":"Over the years, I have worked with dozens of small-to-midsize companies, all of which were in dire need of improving one or more of the following: cost reduction, culture change, customer retention, cycle-time reduction, defect reduction, market-share growth, productivity improvement, and product-service development. You can thus understand why I was curious to know to what extent (if any) Six Sigma could be helpful to small-to-midsize companies.By now we have become well aware of the success of Six Sigma initiatives at major international corporations such as ABB, Allied Signal/Honeywell, Black &amp; Decker, Dow Chemical, Dupont, Federal Express, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Kodak, Motorola, SONY, and Toshiba. Once having read this book, I am convinced that -- with certain modifications -- Six Sigma could perhaps be even more valuable to small-to-midsize companies which, obviously, have fewer resources. What exactly is Six Sigma? The authors provide this definition: \\"A comprehensive and flexible system for achieving, sustaining, and maximizing business success. Six Sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of consumer needs, disciplined use of facts, data, and statistical analysis, and diligent attention to managing, improving, and reinventing business processes.\\"The authors identify what they call \\"hidden truths\\" about Six Sigma:1. You can apply Six Sigma to many different business activities and challenges -- from strategic planning to operations to customer service -- and maximize the impact of your efforts.2. The benefits of Six Sigma will be accessible whether you lead an entire organization or a department. Moreover, you'll be able to scale your efforts, from tackling specific problems to renewing the entire business.3. You'll be prepared to achieve breakthroughs in these untapped gold mines of opportunity -- and to broaden Six Sigma beyond the realm of the engineering community.4. You'll gain insights into how to strike the balance between push and pull -- accommodating people and demanding performance. That balance is where real sustained improvement is found. On either side -- being \\"too nice\\" or forcing people beyond their understanding and readiness -- lie merely short-term goals or no results at all.5. The good news is, Six Sigma is a lot more fun than root canal. Seriously, the significant financial gains from Six Sigma may be exceeded in value by the intangible benefits. In fact, the changes in attitude and enthusiasm that come from improved processes and better-informed people are often easier to observe, and more emotionally rewarding than dollar savings.The authors organize their material as follows: Part One: An Executive Summary of Six Sigma; Part Two: Gearing Up and Adapting Six Sigma to Your Organization; Part Three: Implementing Six Sigma -- The Roadmap and Tools; and finally, The Appendices: Practical Support. According to Jack Welch, \\"The best Six Sigma projects begin not inside the business but outside it, focused on answering the question -- how can we make the customer more competitive? What is critical to the customer's success?...One thing we have discovered with certainty is that anything we do that makes the customer more successful inevitably results in a financial return for us.\\"If anything, it is even more important for small-to-midsize companies (than it is for the GEs of the world) to answer these two questions correctly and then track and compare their performance in terms of what their customers require. The well-publicized objective of Six Sigma is to achieve practically-perfect quality of performance (ie 3.4 defects for every million activities or \\"opportunities\\") and this is indeed an ambitious objective. Collins and Porras, authors of Built to Last, would probably view it as the biggest of Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs). In that book, they assert that the most successful and admired companies have the ability -- and willingness -- to simultaneously adopt two seemingly contrary objectives at the same time. Stability and renewal, Big Picture and minute detail, creativity and rational analysis -- these forces, working together,, make organizations great. This \\"we can do it all\\" approach they call the \\"Genius of the And.\\"Pande, Neuman, and Cavanagh suggest that all manner of specific benefits can result from following \\"the Six Sigma way.\\" For example, Six Sigma generates sustained success, sets a performance goal for everyone, enhances value to customers, accelerates the rate of improvement, promotes learning and \\"cross-pollination\\", and executes strategic change. All organizations (regardless of their size or nature) need to avoid or escape what the authors refer to as the \\"Tyranny of Or.\\" Here in a single volume is about all they need to seek \\"practically-perfect quality of performance.\\" Whether or not they ultimately reach that destination, their journey en route is certain to achieve improvement which would otherwise not be possible."},{"Title":"The Six Sigma Way: How GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies are Honing Their Performance","review":"I found the book to be clearly written and even fun in places. It provides a solid and practical overview of the principles of Six Sigma. It explains Six Sigma as a flexible system to help manage processes in companies. It addressed all the questions I had in trying to decide whether Six Sigma is appropriate for my company. It provides much practical and non-dogmatic advice about how to implement.

Why? Because it debunks the myth that effective improvement programs, for most of their projects, need to include lots of high-level statistics, but rather should involve tools that anyone in the organization can use. Further, The Six Sigma Way brings out in the open the need for and value in the non &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; approach to improvement--every company, every group within a company is different, and an effective approach for each is going to vary somewhat. Finally, it was just fun reading! Examples and case studies were effective in bringing home the concepts in an interesting way, and often humorous as well. Don't miss out on this jewel!"},{"Title":"The Six Sigma Way: How GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies are Honing Their Performance","review":"Continual improvement is the key to survival in today's business climate, and as companies like GE and Motorola have proven, Six Sigma is a useful tool for ingraining the quest for perfection in an organization. After reading The Six Sigma Way, you'll probably be ready to jump out of your chair and immediately follow in these companies' footsteps by launching a Six Sigma initiative of your own. The authors, three consultants who teach firms to implement Six Sigma efforts, convincingly extol the money-saving and efficiency-enhancing virtues of the holistic approach. This book offers a lot of jargon and complex concepts, but the material is presented in easily understood charts and lists, and there are plenty of concrete examples.

Even though it's an overview, there is enough detail that you'll understand what you're into. If you're looking for the details of the tools, such as statistical methods, House of Quality...you'll need to look elsewhere.

It doesn't get too heavy into the advanced statistics, although there is a chapter that explains some of the tools and how they are used.

The authors define it as \\"A comprehensive and flexible system for achieving, sustaining and maximizing business success. Six Sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of customer needs, disciplined use of facts, data, and statistical analysis, and diligent attention to managing, improving, and reinventing business processes.\\"This work is made up of three major sections. The first part provides an executive summary of this system. The second part focuses on the organizational aspects of adopting this system. The last part, focuses on the actual implementation of Six Sigma including the roadmap and tools. Also included in this book, are numerous appendices that provide further \\"practical support\\".What sets this book apart is both the breadth and depth in which the topic is discussed. Whether one is a novice or expert, looking to obtain a high level overview or a deep understanding of the subject matter, this book is for you. In addition, the interspersed case studies, examples and tools make it very practical and applicable. After reading this book - one cannot but concur with the authors' closing remark: \\"We believe - and hope you agree - that there are enough essential, powerful, and valuable elements to make the Six Sigma system, in some way, part of every successful business. At the same time, we strongly encourage you to adapt the discipline and methods of Six Sigma to best impact your unique culture, industry, market position, people, and strategy. Our biggest fear is that people will \\"accept\\" or \\"reject\\" Six Sigma as it it were a thing (falling victim to the Tyranny of the Or) and not use it as a flexible system.\\"Below are key excerpts from the book, that I found particularly insightful:1) \\"The Benefits of Six Sigma: 1) Generates sustained success...2) Sets a performance goal for everyone...3) Enhances value to customers...4) Accelerates the rate of improvement...5) Promotes learning and \\"cross pollination\\"...6) Executes strategic change\\"2) \\"Six Themes of Six Sigma: 1) Genuine Focus on the Customer...2) Data- and Fact-Driven Management...3) Process focus, Management, and Improvement...4) Proactive Management...5) Boundaryless Collaboration...6) Drive for Perfection; Tolerance for Failure\\"3) \\"Six Sigma Improvement and Management Strategies: 1) Process Improvement: Finding Targeted Solutions...2) Process Design/Redesign: Building a Better Business...3) Process Management: The Infrastructure for Six Sigma Leadership\\"4) \\"In the Six Sigma Way, we will use and refer to a five-phase improvement cycle that has become increasingly common in Six Sigma organizations: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control - or DMAIC.\\"5) \\"...The ideal roadmap for establishing the Six Sigma system and launching improvements...1) Identify core processes and key customers. 2) Define customer requirements. 3) Measure current performance. 4) Prioritize, analyze, and implement improvements. 5) Expand and integrate the Six Sigma system.\\"6) \\"Five-step measurement implementation model: 1) Select what to measure 2) Develop operational definitions 3) Identify data sources 4) Prepare collection & sampling plan 5) Implement and refine measurement\\"7) \\"We can offer an assessment model, however, based on two major conditions - both of which must be met if process design/redesign is going to work: 1) A major need, threat, or opportunity exists: a) Shifts in customer needs/requirements...b) Demand for greater flexibility...c) New technologies...d) New or changed rules and regulations...e) Competitors are changing...f) Old assumptions (or paradigms) are invalid...g) The current process is \\"a mess\\"...2) You're ready and willing to take on the risk: a) Longer lead-time for change is acceptable...b) Resources and talent are available...c) Leaders, and the organization as a whole, will support the effort...d) The \\"Risk Profile\\" is acceptable.\\"8) \\"Process Value Analysis: As processes get more complex, they tend to insulate people from the real reason that customers patronize a business. \\"Value Analysis\\" is a way of reemphasizing the key raison d'etre of a business or process by looking at work from the external customer's point of view.

The authors stress the business rationale, business benefits and business judgement required to make Six Sigma effective. They share many cases that illustrate the tools and techniques. They provide insight into dozens of the lessons learned. The work is comprehensive and applicable for any organization. This books helps senior executives to place Six Sigma within the context of long-run strategic investments that are required to compete in the future. Organizations that remain informal and reactive will simply disappear. This book is not a practical cookbook. They published another work for step by step activities. It skims the surface of the underlying statistical methods and insights. It refers to certain aspects of the TQM and ISO initiatives of prior decades, but does not clearly explain the remaining deep insights.

Owens comes from The Millbrook Press as a colorful, well-written basketball card hobby guide. This 80-page library-style hardback is perfect for the younger collector and has more than 50 full color card illustrations inside to accompany the 10 relatively short chapters of text. Mr. Owens is excellent at condensing complex hobby issues into just a paragraph or two. He also gives many good tips on how to buy cards for the best possible price and laments, as almost all hobby observers do, about the recent incredible proliferation of dubious insert sets. I did not come across Mr. Owens' book until well after the chapters that comprise my own basketball card collecting book had already appeared in SPORTS COLLECTORS DIGEST from 1996 to 1998. But I was pleased at the generally similar approach both of our books take to this fascinating pastime. I own a copy of Mr. Owens' book and believe it belongs in most public and school libraries, as well as in the personal library of any serious basketball card hobbyist.

I found this book to be both exciting, and well written. Great job!"},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"The author of the book Favorite Dog Stories, James Herriot, is from Yorkshire, Scotland. This is not the only book Herriot has written. In fact Herriot has written many books. All Things Bright and Beautiful, Lord God Made Them All, and All Things Wise and Wonderful are just to name a few. All of Herriot's books are based on his veterinary practice. Herriot doesn't just write about everyday things, he writes about strange and unusual things that happen to him, his patients, and the patient's owners. Dr. Herriot lives in a very beautiful place in Yorkshire. He lives in the countryside where everything around him is bright and green.One of the strangest stories in his book, Favorite Dog Stories, to me is in chapter seven, Gyp Only One Woof. In this story a dog named Gyp had never barked in his life. Herriot had diagnosed him with epilepsy, but he didn't see why that would cause him not to bark. Dr. Herriot knew the dog wasn't mute so he just waited to see what happened. One day, at a dog show Dr. Herriot saw Gyp and his owner watching the show so he went over to see them. When Gyp saw his brother in the show he so got excited that he barked for the first time in his life! He only barked that one time and never barked again.A story that was sad at times and happy at times happy was in chapter eight, Roy From Rags to Riches. An old woman named Mrs. Donovan who always walked with her beloved dog, Rex, believed that when it came to cats and dogs Herriot wasn't very good at helping them and that she could cure anything with powders and dog shampoos. One day her precious little dog was run over and she called Dr. Herriot, but the dog had been hurt too severely to help and he died. Mrs. Donovan vowed that she would never get another dog. Later on, one of Dr. Herriot's friends found an abused dog that was very sickly. When Dr. Herriot saw the dog he immediately started hinting for Mrs. Donovan to take care of the dog. She accepted taking the dog and cure it after not very coaxing at all. Mrs. Donovan named the dog Roy and took care of him to the point that he recovered fully.In conclusion, Dr. Herriot's books are very popular because he makes his books interesting by telling strange and unusual tales of his veterinary experiences in Yorkshire. Dr. Herriot describes where he lives and his experiences with great detail. For those of you who like animals I would suggest this book. You can tell that Dr. Herriot loves his work."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"The book arrived in VERY short time, and it wasgetting so close to Christmas!

It is really bad."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"If you have any passion for animals at all, you will devour this book. It's so sweet and wonderful -- a masterpiece of 20th century literature.Mr. Herriot was truly a gifted writer. His heart could be felt in every word -- he deeply cared for the animals he doctored over the years. Aside from the endearing tails (pardon the pun), he masterfully described the European countryside, the people who belonged to the pets, the pubs he frequented and his everyday astonishing feats of medical marvelry. Yet he was so humble and down-to-earth. His stories are either tear-jerkers or pant-wetters. More than once I found myself nearly crying during study period at college because I was laughing so hard.Some of my favorite shorts were &quot;The Card Over the Bed&quot;, &quot;Tricki Woo&quot;, &quot;Granville Bennett&quot;, &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Donovan&quot; -- the latter being my favorite. (Mrs. Donovan was a crone who patrolled the streets of Darrowby trying to cure people's animals quite often causing strife for Mr. Herriot.)The very best thing about this book, aside from it being a quick and easy read, is that the stories are broken up so that you can put it down at any time and come back to it without fear of having lost your place.James Herriot was the master of animal literature. Never have I encountered a more tasteful writer who so accurately depicted the behavior of dogs. I am a huge animal lover having two cats and a dog of my own. I found amazing similarities between the antics of the dogs showcased in this book and my own golden lab, and reading it made me want to cuddle him closer."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"James Herriot's Dog Stories is written by a man who loves both people and animals. The descriptions of people, dogs, and his humble view of himself are an irresistable combination. The accuracy and wit with which he presents people's relationships with their dogs is priceless. When I read this book, I laugh at the eternal goofiness of dogs and also dog people! The sadder stories are written with a balanced view. This book is an amazing collection of short stories. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"Do you have a passion for animals? If so, you'll inhale this book. The authors heartfelt emotions can be felt on every page. He clearly adored the animals he cared for over the decades. He described the colorful European countryside, the diverse pets, and the people who owned them in fine detail. Each story is accompanied by an ink sketch that added some warm visuals. My favorite stories were of \\"Tricki Woo\\", \\"Judy The Nurse Dog\\", \\"Granville Bennett\\", and \\"Cigar.\\" What was nice is that since the stories were broken up, you could not lose your place when you took a break. Yet, I only took one because this was a fast page turner. I have had several dogs in my life and these are the most honest depictions of dog behavior I have read thus far. All animal lovers will enjoy this.

Although trained as a vet, James Herriot had a true gift with the written word. These tales about pets and their two-legged counterparts shine a light deep into the mechanisms of human nature.While he succeeded admirably as an honorable animal doctor and found worldwide fame as a late-in-life author, perhaps he missed his true calling as a psychologist. The humor, heartbreak, and humanity that he so eloquently captures in these stories shows a sagacious mind. It's no wonder that his time on earth brought many smiles and caused many a tail to wag."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"This TV vet has put down in words stories of some of his most famous dogs.

It is beautifully illustrated by Lesley Holmes.This book consists of ten stories from Herriot's previous books that feature dogs that he has treated over the years. It's difficult to pick a favorite as they all have amazing personalities. There is Brandy, who is such a scrounger that he gets his tongue stuck in tin cans that he digs out of the trash can. TrickiWoo, a Pekingese, picks winning horses at the races. And Gyp, an epileptic sheepdog, only barked once in his entire life. Although all the dogs have special characteristics, it is obvious that it would take a veterinarian with compassion and humor to see that these animals are more than just pets.I truly enjoyed Favorite Dogs Stories.

I had never read James Herriots books before, but as a child I remembered my parents reading his work. Perhaps I had always associated his writing as belonging to the generation preceding my own - I was not disappointed. This is one of the finest books on dogs (or any animals for that matter) I have read for a long time. By no means is it outdated.We live in a time when we seem to be exposed to the worst of humanity and humanitairan crisis' so I found it somewhat refreshing to read the recollections of this fine veterinarian - Herriot is humourous, compassionate and kind. The book is made up of short stories covering (I imagine) most of Herriots career and centers largely around his canine patients. Some stories are extremely funny, whereas others have a tinge of sadness - dogs having to be put to sleep, abused or lost. Regardless, the articles are well written and I loved it. I hope to find a vet just like him..."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"This is a wonderful collection of stories that will have you laughing, sometimes crying, always enjoying the clever and usually comical view that our beloved veterinarian has of his work, his world, his passion for animals."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"This is the third time I've purchased this book - I keep giving it away. I first read this book several years ago. It was my first by James Herriot, and lead to my reading everything else he's written, plus the TV series and films, plus the audio books read by Christopher Timothy who played James Herriot on the screen. Having just finished reading it again, I can honestly say it is just as fresh as ever.This book is a collection of all the dog stories from James Herriot's other books (All Creatures Great and Small, etc.) into a single volume. Wonderful, heart-warming, and at times, bittersweet, this is a must read for anyone who likes animal stories. And best of all, Herriot added commentary to the end of each story, so you get to read his thoughts on the story after all these years.Because Herriot was a veterinarian in Yorkshire, England, the language is rich with the local color. Some of the terms may be unfamiliar to Americans, but don't let that stop you. Aye (yes) you'll get used to it."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"I bought this book as a gift.

As someone who also reads the books, I can say that these are faithful accountings of Herriot's adventures, though they aren't word for word. Timothy's voice acting is excellent, going back and forth from character to character and accent to accent without hesitation. And as with all Herriot's work, the stories are charming and real and full of hope and good.

(James Harriot is a vet who wrote a book about his past experiences) James Harriot is an interesting writer and a kind and caring veterinarian. James Harriot has written many book's such All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Great and Small, and Cat Stories. James Harriot lives in Yorkshire, England. In the book that I am reading he deals with dogs from clipping nails to delivering puppies.Two of James Harriots experiences were in chapter three, A Triumph of Surgery. The story is about a dog named Tricky Woo. Her owner is a very nice lady who feeds her dog way too much . Mr. Harriot has visited this lady many times about this problem. One day when James comes to the lady's house for a checkup, Tricky Woo is very fat like a football. S o Dr. Harriot takes the dog away and brings it to a barn with other dogs. For two weeks Tricky Woo runs around with other dogs and in no time she is in good shape. When he brings the dog back to his owner she is astonished because her dog is usually a fat dog that just sleeps and eats junk food.Another story I would like to share is in chapter ten, Mrs. Donovan. The story is about and old lady who has this dog, Rex which she loves so much and the dog gets sick and Dr.. Harriot has to be the one to take her dog from her and put it to sleep. Mrs. Donovan was not mad because she didn't want her dog to suffer. Approximately a month later they find a dole yellow lab on the street. So Dr. Harriot and his colleague take it in and the name of the dog is Roy and they thought it sounded like Rex. So they took it to the Mrs. Donovan at first she didn't accept it, but then she stared at the dog and she took the dog. Approximately four months later Dr. Harriot saw the Roy and Mrs. Donovan at a baseball game. The dog was no longer a dark yellow dog but a golden yellow dog. Roy kind of replaced Rex but Mrs. Donovan thought as Rex and Roy of almost the same dog.Overall I think James Harriot's books are well known is because he writes about not only sad stories but also about happy and weird stories. I would recommend this book to someone because it is an interesting book but it is very long."},{"Title":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories","review":"This book is a collection of his many dog stories from other books of his.

Written in the early 1920s, this novel may seem a bit dated in its language and cultural references to modern readers, but it is absorbing and shrewdly observed, with well-drawn characters who will remain with the reader after they close the book. The novel was considered somewhat shocking at the time it was published for describing romantic/sexual attachments on the part of what, at the time, were considered young children, and delivers some passionate observations on the conflict between art and \\"civilization\\" through its characters.The novel focuses on the Sanger family, headed up by Albert Sanger, a womanizing, self-involved English composer of some note, who has secluded himself and his family of undisciplined children in a chalet in the Austrian Tyrol. The children are from two different marriages and one liaison, and show varying degrees of their father's artistic brilliance as well as his contempt for societal norms. The household is propped up by the two eldest children, Caryl and Kate, who are already young adults and the most stable of the menagerie. The middle four children are the product of Sanger's second marriage to Evelyn Churchill, an Englishwoman of good family who cut herself off from her family to marry him, while the youngest is the product of Sanger's liaison with his current mistress (both wives are dead).The novel opens with the almost immediate death of the seriously ill Sanger, leaving four of his five younger children parentless. The youngest child disappears from the story very soon with her mother, as do the two eldest children, who have careers of their own to follow, one as an operatic soprano and the other as a conductor.It is the fate of Evelyn Churchill's four children, ranging in age from ten to sixteen, around which the novel revolves. Their closest relatives turn out to be their uncle, the dead Evelyn's brother, Charles, and his adult daughter, Florence, their cousin. Charles, the headmaster of a highly regarded private boys' school, is notified of the now parentless state of his sister's children.Charles sends the 28-year-old Florence to the Tyrol to take charge of her unruly young cousins. Her intention is to bring them back to England with her and place them in proper boarding schools where they can acquire discipline and basic education, and become suitably civilized. As soon as she arrives, Florence sees that she has her work cut out for her. The eldest, Antonia, sixteen years old, has recently been seduced by a rich friend of Sanger's, Jacob Birnbaum, who has fallen deeply in love with the beautiful young girl and offers to marry her. At first doubtful of this plan, Florence realizes that at 16, placing Antonia in a boarding school is unlikely to prove successful, especially given Antonia's state of newly awakened sexuality, and Florence agrees that the marriage is perhaps the best solution for Antonia. That leaves Teresa, or Tessa as she is called (14), Pauline (12), and Sebastian (10). Pauline evidences serious dramatic talent, and Sebastian is a gifted pianist - it is clear that these two children, at least, already have some direction that can guide their futures. Only Tessa shows no particular sign of the family heritage of quirky brilliance - artistically, at least.Rounding out the bizarre household that Florence finds when she gets to the Tyrol is Sanger's best friend, the rebellious, charismatic, and gifted young English composer Lewis Dodd, who, like the children's dead mother, is from a fine English family from whom he has cut himself off, and whose hypocrisies and pretensions he despises. Young Tessa has loved Lewis with all her heart since she was a little girl; she feels as if she belongs to him, and her portion of the family gift is an unnatural openness and clarity of mind - she understands Lewis completely and has known from a terrifyingly young age that they belong together. Already, at 14, she knows how to handle him and sustain him in a way that is quite startling in so young a girl. Her strange maturity where he is concerned, their perfect complementariness, is something that so far, her young age has kept Lewis blind to, although her sisters and brother, with the offhanded intuition of children, are aware of it. It is this aspect of the novel, Tessa's passionate devotion to Lewis at so young an age, that shocked readers of the 1920s - the novel makes no bones about the fact that the young Tessa loves the thirty-year-old Lewis the way an adult woman loves a man. The novel does not, to its credit, condescend to Tessa's love for Lewis, or pass it off as a \\"phase\\" or \\"crush\\", but presents it as real and deep: Tessa is not the victim of a schoolgirl crush, but a girl who has seen her heart's destiny too early.To Tessa's dismay, Florence and Lewis fall immediately in love and get themselves quickly married. Tessa's dismay is part personal anguish but part dread: she knows that Florence has fallen in love with Lewis's surface, that Florence has no knowledge of Lewis's darker nature and his capacity for cruelty. After their honeymoon, Lewis moves with Florence to England, where Florence buys a house. Tessa and Pauline are sent to a boarding school with other nice English schoolgirls where they are miserable. Sebastian does better at his school because of his wit, detached nature, and undeniable musical gifts, but none of the Sanger children are happy as they move from their unfettered past to what Florence cheerfully calls \\"the shades of the prison house\\".Florence believes herself to be sophisticated and tolerant, and she is quite knowledgeable about music. But, although initially charmed by her histrionic cousins, the conflict between her fundamentally conformist views and their freewheeling natures, which reverence nothing but music, soon begins to take a toll on the relationships among the characters - especially between Florence and Lewis. Florence begins to try to \\"manage\\" Lewis's career and push it forward using her contacts in English music circles, deaf to his passionate insistence that he doesn't give a damn whether anyone hears his music or not, and to his increasing hostility as she tries to force him to embrace the very Establishment values of \\"success\\" that he fled at sixteen when he left home. As their polarized views of life and art emerge, the marriage begins to fray. These tensions escalate when Tessa and Pauline, unable to cope any longer with the mob rule that characterizes English boarding school life and that is so contrary to their individualistic upbringing, run away and arrive on the Dodd's doorstep, to Lewis's approval and Florence's fury. Florence wants to send them back, but the school will not take the Sanger sisters back, they are too disruptive. Pauline is quickly shipped off to a dramatic academy in France, but Tessa has nowhere to go and finds herself between Florence and Lewis in their home, a position that becomes ever more dangerous as the Dodd marriage deteriorates. Florence, sensing Lewis's partiality for Tessa, increasingly resents her young cousin's presence, although she still does not grasp the depth of their attachment.It is Charles, Florence's father, who first recognizes the true nature of the profound bond between Lewis and Tessa, and the looming disaster that will occur the moment Lewis himself becomes fully aware of it. Charles tries to warn Florence to be less vicious toward her cousin and less domineering toward her husband, behaviors that are driving Lewis away. Charles even offers to educate Tessa privately in his own household - he likes Tessa enormously, enchanted by her unusually broad and perceptive mind. Charles believes that if he can get Tessa out of the Dodd household, he can save her from an early involvement with Lewis that will blight her young life, and give Florence a chance to salvage her marriage.But it is too late - the novel is already building to its inevitable confrontations between the unbidden nature of art and love and the artificial boundaries of civilization. Florence's doom is that she is both the invader and the victim of the little world whose Bohemian character once so charmed her; she has wandered, unwary, into an environment that is hostile to her essential ideas of order and morality. Despite her beauty, sophistication, and good intentions, Florence remains an outsider in this world, which she despises while longing for true membership in it. She hates and envies her cousins for their natural citizenship in this world. Tessa and Lewis, on their parts, realize at last not only that they belong to each other, but that they do not belong in Florence's neatly ordered universe. No compromise is possible here, only tragedy.This beautifully written novel explores uncomfortable truths about the nature of love and genius. I stumbled upon it first as a young girl and have revisited it since with admiration as well as pleasure. It is, as mentioned earlier, acutely observed, and if you like English literature and the early 20th-century English \\"voice\\", you will likely adore this stylishly presented work. I'm delighted to see that it is available in print again."},{"Title":"The Constant Nymph","review":"What a discovery, this book by a British author little known in the US. Margaret Kennedy creates the atmosphere of a creative rather mad household in vivid detail. We love the Sanger children, not quite certain at the beginning who is our heroine from the way we are brought into their Alpine retreat. The omniscient point of view gives us insights on even the characters who are relatively stereotyped by today's sensibilities: the Russian ballet designer, the wealthy Jewish family friend. Kennedy's broad sympathies and wisdom on love and the relation of the sexes make this much more than a period romance or 'woman's book,', and her depiction of musical genius vs bourgeois society is complex.

My professor, a remarkably learned fellow with a tremendous knowledge of American literature, would occasionally reference it with amused appreciation. In our discussion of the Last of the Mohicans, I can still recall his enjoyment in recounting Lawrence's description of Cooper, sitting in a hotel room in a European city, with his gentleman's finery, surrounded by all of the trappings of a genteel aristocrat, living a sort of Walter Mitty life through his virtual antithesis -- Natty Bumpo, the protagonist of the Leatherstocking tales. To this day, I am amazed whenever I read this little tome, since Lawrence captures, in a few short essays, the essence of such authors as Franklin, Whitman, Cooper, and Melville. His style, so cheeky and incisive, is a joy to read. Lawrence had an astonishing grasp of what it is that makes American literature so fundamentally different from that which was composed by his own countrymen. He brings a pschoanalytic, Jungian perspective to bear on these great works, and sees in Natty Bumpo, Ishmael, and other heroes of American literature the archetypes of our collective American unconscious. Of course, this work tells us as much about Lawrence as it does about great American writers, which is why it makes such great reading. Lawrence is well known for being a novelist, but his corpus contains much else besides: travel literature, criticism, poetry, essays. This one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"There are three reasons to read STUDIES IN CLASSIC AMERICAN LITERATURE by D.H. Lawrence. First: to better understand Lawrence and his themes. Second: to be entertained. Criticism is rarely rendered with so much passion, wit and clarity. Third: to experience American culture from an outsider's perspective, a very knowledgeable though albeit highly opinionated perspective (which makes for that entertainment value).DHL's prevailing theory is that to emerge as a distinct cultural, as well as distinct political entity free from Europe, America had to go through some growing pains before arriving at its authentic self. America had to kill off the European in its heart. He starts out with Ben Franklin, whom he gives a real trouncing for the overly self-conscious act of assigning an American character with a shopping list of virtues. (It should come as no surprise that DHL especially has trouble with \\"chastity.\\") Ben may be generating a fake, a lie, but he marks the beginning of an effort to break with the old homeland, Europe. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur is next in line for a beating. He moved his unfortunate family to the frontier, wrote the letters glowing with the accounts of the American Dream amongst the nature and the \\"savages\\" and then went back to France to revel in literary salons. When he returned, the wife and farm had met brutal ends in that American dream in which he had left them, so he settled in New York City. DHL screams, \\"Fake!\\" But Crevecoeur did announce the concept of an ideal tied to the unique attributes of the new world.DHL takes us through Cooper, Poe and Hawthorne, who begin to make progress (and also give DHL space to expound in ways that have annoyed his feminist critics), and onto Dana (TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST) and Melville, who go to sea to find themselves and their American consciousness. It is Melville who smashes the old mold forever and makes way for Whitman to plow through with a new road, singing that song of self.We get the tour of the past; we get, obliquely, a tour of post World War I intellectual preoccupations; and we get DHL being DHL at full throttle."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"this is a masterpiece, and you do not have to know much about books to notice the expertise of the author, his sense of what he is writing.he has really given me an orientation into the vast lands of american letters.he has set me going into a different direction and has made me read some books again. i recommend this book to anybody with a deep interest in american letters, but please keep reading this author, he is wonderful. LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"D.H. Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature is by no means a comprehensive analysis of the American classics at the time Lawrence wrote his collection of essays. The works of Harriet Beecher-Stowe and Mark Twain are notably missing. But Lawrence's aim was not to analyze all the seminal works of American literature. He chose specific authors who fit his agenda and constructed an evolutionary argument around them. Lawrence's main thread is that America can't emerge as a culture in its own right until it discards completely the influence of Old Europe and finds its own \\"spirit of place\\"--the sense of who the people are and what drives them. The author's search for this spirit of place results in a more or less disparaging analysis of each American author in turn, with few exceptions of genuine praise.We begin with Benjamin Franklin. Lawrence derides him for advocating \\"the perfectability of man\\" (Lawrence 15) and creating a list of virtues, and proceeds in doing the same himself. \\"I will try always to recognize and submit to the gods in me and the gods in other men and women.\\" This is of course merely a symbol; Lawrence was not pagan. But it begs the question: If we are supposed to accept all these new rules at face value, based only on Lawrence's discursive analyses and often abstract philosophizing, doesn't it stand to reason that Benjamin Franklin's rules were open to symbolic interpretation as well? I marvel at Lawrence, actually. He makes a good deal of sense, but he too hits a wrong note sometimes. And then speaks entirely in absolutes for the whole book, as if his opinion truly is the only one. Suffice to say Benjamin Franklin was a good deal more intelligent than Lawrence makes him out to be and was horrifically underserved by Lawrence.From Franklin onward, Lawrence hardly has a good thing to say about any of the American authors. Sometimes they deserve it. Hector St. John De Crevecoeur gets slammed for oversimplifying nature and idealizing the frontier lifestyle in his Letters from an American Farmer. Fenimore Cooper really gets it for romanticizing the frontier, the relations between white men and Native Americans, and for utilizing the 1800's literary conventions of his contemporaries when concocting a love triangle. I agree that the conventions were stale and unrealistic, but what can one expect when everyone wrote their historical fiction with those same tired conventions? I'm pretty sure somebody out there thinks The Last of the Mohicans is a classic of 1800's historical fiction right up there with Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis.Poe is \\"rather a scientist than an artist,\\" because he \\"reduc[es] his own self as a scientist reduces a salt in a crucible.\\" Lawrence seems to like him until he accuses Poe of trying to make his \\"disease\\" (love) fair and attractive--which, as it turns out, is the \\"duplicity of art, American art in particular.\\" Good to know.Nathaniel Hawthorne writes hellish romance, says Lawrence, and has such a fixation with sin that it becomes stale. Thank you, Lawrence, for going after The Scarlett Letter with a vengeance. That one deserved it. Richard Henry Dana's Two Years Before the Mast is where Lawrence starts getting very metaphysical. (I wouldn't advise anyone to read individual chapters out of order. This really must be read as a consecutive whole or you won't understand a thing.)But Lawrence likes sea voyages. He has praise for Herman Melville--and criticisms. Melville is criticized for finding a tropical paradise and wanting to return to civilization. Then Moby Dick comes along, and we find out the white whale is a symbol of the \\"deepest blood-being of the white race...our deepest blood-nature.\\" We hunt him because we want to \\"subject him to our will.\\" That is, the men hunt him. Lawrence doesn't have much to say to us women other than criticize us for wearing our American suits.Walt Whitman. Lawrence really likes Whitman. He derives from Whitman the concept of true American Democracy, souls meeting on the Open Road, free to do as they please. But he still criticizes him for following the Christian doctrine in his philosophy, confounding \`sympathy' with \\"Jesus' LOVE, and with Paul's CHARITY.\\"Lawrence was a very brilliant individual, a devoted critic, and an insightful analyst. I enjoyed Studies in Classic American Literature immensely upon my first reading. For the most part, if there are faults to find in American literature he will point them out. That's all right, somebody had to do it. But I wish he'd rein it in just a little. No need to antagonize the ladies, Lawrence--or couldn't you predict that women would read your book some eighty years into the future? His trick of using he exclamation mark to prove a point was fun at first, and got really old by the time I got to Walt Whitman, though this could possible be attributed to the fact that Lawrence starts out very concrete and moves so far into the abstract that readers may have trouble following him unless they read the entire book in one sitting and keep all the cross-references fresh in their memories. He's also a little too self-important for my liking. We all know there are problems with the American classics. Did Lawrence never consider that we wouldn't like to be preached at the same way he didn't take to the self-righteous Americans like Benjamin Franklin and Nathaniel Hawthorne?"},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"In this analysis of (not always) well-known classic US authors D. H. Lawrence gives his personal, but very revealing, view on the heart of the American soul, the old and the new moralities and the cardinal aspects of the gender battle. These brilliant essays tell also a lot about the author himself and the backgrounds of his life vision.David Herbert LawrenceThis world-class author was highly influenced by Nietzsche (rejection of the Christian slave and anti-senses morality, his anti-democratic stance and his misogyny) and Freud (the un- and subconscious).The old and the new moralitiesIn the old morality, the \`soul' of man stands above the \`flesh'. In the new morality, the \`soul' \`sits in the dark limbs, in the body of the prostitute, in the sick flesh of the syphilitic'.American soul\`The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer'.The essential American action is destruction.The spirit of the place is freedom to lynch anybody who is not one of them (racism).The labor class is obedient because of the continual influx of more servile Europeans.American literatureBENJAMIN FRANKLIN \`doesn't let me have a soul of my own. He says that I am nothing but a servant of mankind, a galley-slave.' But he was also a destroyer: \`Extirpate the savages to make room for the cultivators of the earth.'HECTOR ST JOHN DE CREVECOEUR (\`Letters from an American Farmer') shows that there are no \`Sweet Children of Nature. All fraternity and equality go up in smoke and his ideal of pure sweet goodness along with it.'For JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, there can be no blood-mixing between the white and the red race. His world is a paradise for killers (\`The Deerslayer', \`The Last of the Mohicans').EDGAR ALLAN POE is fascinated by inquisition, torture and murder. For him, a woman is \`a vulture of stern passion'. \`Drugs, women, self-destruction are adventurers in the horrible passages of the human soul.'In NATHANAEL HAWTHORNE's \`The Scarlet Letter', the male protagonist is \`a spiritual fornicator and a liar'. The female protagonist is the destroyer of the white consciousness, of the old moral, of spiritual love.DANA's \`Two Years before the Mast' depicts the sea as the cosmic enemy, as the great disintegrating force, leaving the human nerves blank.HERMAN MELVILLE hated the white world and searched for a savage Eden (\`Typee'). But, he came to understand that \`civilized' people can't go back. \`Moby Dick', the white whale, represents \`the deepest blood-being of the white race', \`that lonely phallic monster of the individual you.' The whale is hunted by our old consciousness. His death is a suicide.WALT WHITMAN is the first author to break down the old morality. He gives the soul its own life, a life of sympathy. But he misinterprets sympathy as a feeling \`for', not as a feeling \`with'. His individual self leaked out of him into the universe (\`Democracy', \`En Masse', \`No Identity').These remarkable interpretations and insights are a must read of all lovers of world and US literature."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"This book is literary criticism about some of America's most famous writers. Basically, it is a &quot;Lawrencian&quot; reading of classics.D.H. Lawrence comments on Benjamin Franklin, Melville, Hawthorne, Dana, Fenimore Cooper, Poe, Whitman, and de Crevecoeur. In doing so, he is trying to get a picture of what America is and what it is trying to do. Although he mentions his interest in some, all fall short of the mark of creating a new identity for America.If you have ever read notes by Lawrence on some of his novels (like &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot;), you will see the repeat of a lot of ideas and language. This was written later in his life, so it does make sense that some of his ideas of the blood-relationship would come again.I would not recommend this book for people trying to understand American writing (except maybe to use this as contrast), but I would highly recommend this for anyone studying D.H.

Lawrence is the only writer I know of who was able to trace the priggish type of American back to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was a great man, but one of his more regrettable legacies appears in the modern WASP holier-than-thou type, the type that thinks it's inherently immoral to stay up late, and inherently moral to be a non-smoker. Take a close look at his interests and you'll see that it's to his advantage to preach what is, basically, servility. The rest of us Americans can't stand him (I'm convinced that Al Gore lost the election because he embodies this type), but his belief in his own piety remains unshaken to this day.

Judy Rogers uses mostly guitar with her songs. She has a very pleasant-sounding voice. She comes from a Reformed background - each song is well-written and pure in its doctrine.

My children have grown up listening to her many tapes - this one is for the younger ones, say ages 3 to 10. I have bought over a dozen copies as birthday gifts for friends of mine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Go to the Ant","review":"Years ago, when I was little my bought this tape for us to listen to. It has been listen to so much that the tape is worn and in bad shape. You have to have full volume to even hear it sometimes. I remember sitting in the car listening to it rather that going inside some place with my dad. The song playing was about Isabel the pig. &quot;Isabel is a pig with a ring in her snout. You can dress Izzy up, but you can't take her out. She will jump in the middle of a big muddle, because Isabel is pig.&quot; All the trappings in the world, don't look pretty when you act like a fool or put on a pouty face.My favorite song is &quot;The School of the Fool.&quot; The guy in the song was &quot;A first class, A+, student in the school of the fool.&quot; He was mean, lazy, etc.&quot;Go to the Ant&quot; is really a well known saying from the Bible. It is also something we should be paying attention to. The ant doesn't have a boss looking over her shoulder. She does the work anyway. She works all day. Not like us. Some do may be, but most work a five, six, seven, eight, nine hour shift. Not from son up 'till sun down. &quot;Are you responcible? Do you ever do a job without being told to? Or are you the lazy kind? And you mother and your father always have to scold you?&quot; &quot;Go to the ant, observe her. See how she works all day. And she doesn't even have a captain to tell her what to do, but she works hard anyway. Go to the ant, and listen. Tell me does she complain. She is God's illustration of organisation. God made her, now you immitate her. Go to the ant.&quot; &quot;Well, there was a poor irrisponcible sluggard who slept when there was work to be done. Too late he realized his foolish behavior and poverty struck him like a man with a gun. Go to the ant.&quot;I still find my self singing the song about the seven things God hates. &quot;There are six things, even seven, that the Lord, that he cannot stand: Proud looking eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that thinks of wicked things to do, feet that run to evil do, anyone who loves to lie about others, and one who causes trouble with his brothers.&quot; &quot;God hates things that we should hate too.&quot;&quot;From the lips of the little ones, he has ordained his praise.&quot; &quot;You made man a little lower than the angels, put things under his feet.&quot;&quot;Talk to me. Show me that you care. Talk to me. Listen to what I say. Talk to me. There's so much we can share. I know you love me when you talk to me.&quot; &quot;He always takes the time to talk to me.&quot;I remember times when I didn't care much for Christian music (didn't know much about it either), the music was too dull, but (little children music it may be), music like this appeal to me ten times what the rest did.The beats great, the words are not only great, but (sorry to about half the bands in the world) they are understandable. The message is clear and it is clearly benificial rather that to your potential downfall as some music now a days is.I highly recommend this tape, whether you are getting it for a little kid like my mom was, or you're getting it for yourself. You won't regret it.PS - I'm listening to it as I write this."},{"Title":"The Words of Gardner Taylor:Sermon From The Middle Years 1970-1980 (Words of Gardner Taylor) volume 2","review":"A must read for all preachers.

She hasn't heard anything since a bomb brought her office down around her in 1942, but she never quite lost the look of listening for what she could never hear again. While resting her feet, she idly starts lip-reading the conversation of a pair of men across the gallery who would otherwise be safe from eavesdroppers - and gets a nasty shock upon learning that they're planning a hold-up, and don't care who's killed in the process of taking something away from a secretary on his way back from a bank. She gets an even worse shock later, upon learning that they noticed her, and one of them saw her portrait, and learned about her name and lip-reading from the gallery attendant.At that point, she has the good sense to use her connection with the Morays to make an appointment with Maud Silver, governess-turned-PI. Pauline tells her the whole story -and she has an excellent memory for words, although no talent for describing faces. Unfortunately, when she like so many others gets cold feet, she doesn't immediately take Maud's advice and go to the police, feeling that they'll treat her lip-reading as a fantasy. [Oddly enough, Pauline turns out to have been right - for reasons I don't pretend to fathom, Maud's friends among the police really *are* reluctant to believe anybody could have lip-read such a conversation.] The point soon becomes moot, since Pauline is killed by a hit-and-run driver before she could repeat her story to the police. Somebody miscalculated badly there, though; Maud's excellent memory and stern conscience ensure that the matter won't be dropped, and Frank Abbott and his colleagues on the Force respect her enough to face fact when Lucius Bellingdon's secretary is killed while retrieving a valuable necklace from his bank in Ledlington.Bellingdon engages Maud to go undercover as his new secretary, since the theft required inside information. She balks at this, not being a typist, but this isn't really a problem; he has 2 secretaries, the senior of which was the victim, who was really more of an assistant to Bellingdon - sorting wheat from chaff in his correspondence and so on - while the other secretary is the one required to possess the more usual job skills. Going undercover, of course, presents no problems; her experience as a governess gave her one of her greatest professional assets, the ability to pass unnoticed in a drawing room as well as on the street.Some really entertaining stuff, apart from the usual well-presented puzzle: Maud's private opinion of what people invariably say when information has leaked, and how little men know about what gossip really goes on; Bellingdon's widowed daughter Moira, who's too much of a Philistine to understand when David Moray wants to paint her as Medusa; Moira's old acquaintance, Moray's neighbour Sally, with her job fielding silly letters to the author Marigold Marchbanks (that part's *really* cute). The characters are far from bland, so this qualifies as a good novel as well as a good mystery."},{"Title":"The Listening Eye","review":"Patricia Wentworth mysteries are books which I love to read multiple times. I first read this particular title several years ago and found that I did not specifically remember who the culprit was. Happy days for me again!Paulina Paine lost her hearing as a result of a bomb blast during the war and has learned to make the best of a bad situation. She has developed her ability to lip-read to a fine art. Often she would find herself privy to conversations which she did not want to overhear. Such was the case when she noticed the two men talking when she visited the art gallery to see the works of two young men included in the current exhibition. David Moray had painted, and sold, a picture of Paulina and even she had to admit that it was a really good depiction of her. Such good things could not be said for the art of Wilfrid Gaunt, her cousin Hilda's son. While taking a break from walking around the gallery Paulina lip-read the remarks of one of the two men who seemed to have met by accident. Only one part of the conversation was shown to her but it was enough to send her trembling from the gallery to the comfort of a good cup of tea. Paulina had seen the plans for a robbery being made and they included the murder of the person being robbed. No location, person or specific item was described. Paulina knew that the police would never believe her, there was just not enough information to give them. She did, however, know about Miss Maude Silver and she immediately made arrangements to meet with Miss Silver and tell her all about the crime which was to take place. As is often the case, once Paulina had told her story to Miss Silver, she felt so relieved that she declined to go to the police and even refused to take a taxi home. On her way home, she fell under a bus and was killed.Something which I am always fascinated by in a Patricia Wentworth mystery is to see how she will bring all her characters together in one place so that they are all involved in the mystery. This time, these people are all brought together by the fact that Lucius Bellingdon bought the picture of Paulina Paine painted by David Moray. A gathering of people is assembled at Merefields, the country house of Lucius Bellingdon and we have a chance to meet and get to know each of these characters as Miss Silver quietly sits and listenes to anything anyone says, no matter how trivial it may seem.I enjoyed this story, although it is not my favorite Miss Silver story. This one seems to have quite a bit of repititious material in it. That in itself is not unusual, Miss Silver has to relate everything she finds out to the police and to her employer. But in this book she also seems to tell it all to quite a few other people. Wentworth has given us some very strong \\"good\\" characters and some equally strong \\"bad\\" characters. There is the looked for (and thoroughly enjoyed) romance between two \\"bright young things\\". It all follows the Wentworth pattern very well. I usually like to see quite a bit more of the Scotland Yard end of the story but this one is pretty much solved by Miss Silver and her deductive powers.One other reviewer says that this would be a good place for the novice reader of Patricia Wentworth to start. I'm afraid I don't agree. This one might be a little less interesting to someone who doesn't know the Wentworth style and how she will tie all the loose ends together into that very neat package I require. Try THE CHINESE SHAWL, THE CATHERINE WHEEL, MISS SILVER COMES TO STAY, THE CASE OF WILLIAM SMITH, SHE CAME BACK or THE IVORY DAGGER. All are capital stories. But then, for me, any Patricia Wentworth/Maude Silver story is capital!"},{"Title":"The Listening Eye","review":"Miss Silver is wonderful in this, standing up to the rich and headstrong Mr. Bellingdon. The solution to this mystery isn't difficult or complicated but the story of Paulina Paine and her ability to read lips which leads to knowledge of a impending robbery which leads to murder. The threads are gathered by Miss Silver and she is the leading force behind the discovery of the culprit. Another great. Mostly I enjoy how Wentworth makes people come to life for me. I hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"The Listening Eye","review":"The Miss Silver cozy mysteries were written between 1928 and 1961. This is the 27th, written in 1955 when the author was about 77. All of the books have similar frameworks and characters and the pleasure comes from seeing how the same skeleton is fleshed out with a different body. There is the country house, filled with people; at least one couple in love; more than one person with a grudge; and assorted red herrings. Miss Silver, a retired governess with an uncanny knack for drawing people out and seeing through what they say, is on hand to unravel the mystery. The previous book, \\"The Benevent Treasure\\", was one of the best, with an unusual Gothic slant. This one, alas, falls short. It feels like the written version of sleepwalking...you know the basics and fill in the words almost by rote. There are many other books in the series that are excellent, very good, or enjoyable, and some that are sadly mediocre. \\"The Listening Eye\\" falls into that (mercifully small) category. There are characters who are so annoying you wish someone would knock them off just so you wouldn't have to encounter them again, like Wilfred, an avant-garde painter. There are others who are a bit too goody-goody for my taste, like Sally, the secretary who doesn't give Wilfred the trimming he deserves. There are unbelievable coincidences, such as a connection between a tenant of a deaf woman (who has the \\"listening eye\\" because she lip-reads) and the victim of a crime whose details are lip-read. Is it a bad book? No, it's okay. It's just not the best of the series and doesn't grip the reader the way others do."},{"Title":"The Listening Eye","review":"This is a fine example of a Miss Silver mystery. Ms. Wentworth has done a marvellous job of setting a scene and of outlining some unforgettable characters. She also proved why she was called the queen of the British country house mystery. This is as fine an example of this type of story as any that she wrote. In this book we have the cunning and intelligent Miss Silver pitted against a strong male character, and Miss Silver does not come off the worse in any of their heated exchanges. The premise for the book is also a good one. It all starts when a deaf woman lip-reads about a theft and a murder plot while she is sitting in an art gallery. Her unease about what she has seen brings her to Miss Silver, and from there Miss Silver manages to have herself in residence where she thinks that more crimes will occur. And she as always is not mistaken. This would be a good book for novices to the Miss Silver mysteries to get started reading the many books in this series."},{"Title":"Ruthie's Gift","review":"In order to pass time on a ten-hour drive to visit my husband's family, he and I took turns reading outloud Ruthie's Gift, which we had bought as a gift for our niece.

At the beginning of the book, Ruthie is eight years old. She is the only girl swimming in a sea of six brothers, three older and three younger. She longs for a sister or other girls to play with. There are many things that Ruthie would like to do but because she is a girl, she's not allowed. I love her feisty spirit. At times, Ruthie doesn't appreciate her brothers, but they love her very much. As they say, she's the only sister that they have.This book gives us a taste of what it was like to grow up in 1916. Imagine having a glass of water freeze on your night table. Brrrr! I would not want to get out of bed. Doctors still make house calls and the treatment of pneumonia is astounding! There is no radio or TV. You make your own entertainment. People make there own clothes and girls are expected to know how to sew and knit. We see the worry about the war in Europe. Perhaps the United States ought to join the fight but even with six brothers, would Ruthie want to lose one fighting in the war? Kids have chores and then they go out to play. They fall down and get hurt but nobody gets sued.I don't know if it was the author's intention, but there is more than one Gift in \\"Ruthie's Gift\\".

A variety of styles and practices are explored including Jamaican bush doctors, balm yard healers, kumina, obeah, myal and mother healers. \\"Jamaica Folk Medicine\\" is an in-depth study by two Ph.D's with input from their students, in short, it is built on solid scholarship. The book highlights Jamaican healing methods but also discusses its connections to other forms of healing in the African diaspora and elsewhere. The only thing readers might have to get past is the dry writing style--once you get past the lackluster presentation, there is much to learn.

Payne-Jackson is an American anthropologist and Alleyne a Jamaican linguist. They demonstrate an extensive knowledge of the published literature on the subject and, in addition, have done extensive field research. The book effectively covers herbal, spiritual, and magical causes and treatments for illnesses and misfortunes. Jamaicans still utilize a large number of herbal treatments, along with magical oils, incense, and powders. In most cases, their folk medicine is intimately tied to religious beliefs and practices. Traditional healers are still common in the population. Even though the medical profession and government institutions ignore the folk sector, the authors argue that folk medicine is increasing in popularity, partly because of the difficulty of accessing and affording mainstream medicine but also because of the faith people hold in it. The book is well-organized, clear and easy to follow. It is also definitely the best source of information on the topic."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This is a fabulous book written in classic Hardy style.

Although I do not feel it is one of Hardy's finest, it was, never the less, entertaining. It did not seem to achieve the level of pathos, or engender the concern for the main characters that \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" did. There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story. All said, I am glad I read \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\". I enjoyed it very much, I just didn't LOVE it."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a good mystery. The characters were \\"round\\" rather than 'flat' which generated an interest in what happened to them.

I am a fan of The Classics."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy has written a surprisingly modern novel.I love all his classic stories.I can never decide which one is my favorite.His characters,his plots and his settings are very realistic."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This book is difficult to read at first as it is written in a dialect we are not used to, however once that is established the story moves right along and the characters become familiar. I felt many of the characters were flat and not fleshed out enough. Elizabeth lacked \\"backbone\\" I wanted her to have a bit more of the spunk of her \\"friend\\". I really liked the mayor and wished that he could have just thought before he opened his mouth. Mr Hardys descriptions of the English countryside put me right there with him. A good read."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Though I expected sadness and misery, I was hoping for something more profound at the ending than \\"Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.\\"This is a many chaptered narrative that shows how the results of good intentioned-or-not mistakes can lead to personal ruin. The reader also will lose all respect for the main character.A problem with Victorian Period literary giants I have is their long sentences. I counted one at 82 words.Would only recommend this to someone who likes a challenging read (big words and colloquial language) and who doesn't mind a depressing, predictable story.\\"The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid.\\" Best line."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Having just finished reading Thomas Hardy's Tess of the de'Ubervilles I just had to read another of his books.I found this one and enjoyed it just as much if not more so.I'm sort of on a run of reading classic books. Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Michael Henchard, a 21-year-old itinerant farmhand, enters a refreshment tent with his wife and baby girl at a country fair. Depressed by his poverty, Henchard gets blind drunk. He'd get along so much better without the burden of a family, he declares to one and all - and he offers his wife for sale to the highest bidder.Am amiable sailor throws down five guineas, and Susan Henchard, babe in arms, goes off with him.Amazingly, such things did happen in nineteenth-century rural England. This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Character is fate. Henchard's nature, violent and remorseful, jealous and generous by turns, will give him no rest in this life. We can't help pitying the man, deeply flawed though he is.The Mayor of Casterbridge is a classic of English literature. It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color. Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago. It is about a man so destitute and desperate he sells his wife and baby daughter. Unburdeoned, his pockets full, he goes off to seek his fame and fortune. Though he becomes the wealthy and much-respected Mayor of Casterbridge, he is unable to escape the horror of what he has done. Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child. So well written, so cativating, it is like the making of a braid, every page woven together neatly, to a grand and shocking finale. This book turned me into a Hardy fan."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"What a story! What a tragedy! The Mayor of Casterbridge faces secrets told and untold, misunderstandings, betrayals, loves won and lost... a bona fide soap opera set in a faraway time! Yes, some of the coincidences are a little too convenient, but they kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning! And in the end I cried. This book's characters help us to consider the effects on others of the way we live our own lives. We are truly sorry for the way the Mayor lived his."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; was a wonderful story which engulfs the reader in perhaps one of the greatest stories I have ever read. Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is very clear in this novel. The plot changes are never expected, and what seems a boring read unravels into a classic tragedy that everyone must read. In conclusion I highly recommend this novel to everybody."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Ah, the small town of Casterbridge, or rather the outskirts to start. Michael Henchard's drunken stupor leads to the sale of his wife and child. Years later, now a successful mayor of Caterbridge, the two women come back into his life, and his world falls apart all over again. Read about his chaotic journey into his own personal hell and the resulting reactions from the rest of the townspeople. Mystery, scandal, betrayal, all wrapped into one delightful package!"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Hardy's exploration into the character of Henchard makes this novel an all time classic. Those that have rated it low have simply not given themselves the time to read it properly. Henchard's complexity, his heroic flaws, remind me of Shakespere's King Lear. Hardy paints an equally vivid picture of the characters around him, especially Elizabeth, an understated character who grows with the book. It is a must for anyone who has read and enjoyed Hardy."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Very few people can see the real meaning of reading, especially reading a classic. God, geez, why review a book when you have NO clue of what happened, why even review this book if you had been forced to read it for class?Well, now that there are reviews with 5 stars and a few with 1, try it out, see what all the rants and rave's about."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I read this book for my English exam and after reading it, I cannot understand how it can be described as a classic novel. The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for &quot;fun&quot;. I agree wholeheartedly with the author of &quot;Classically Boring&quot; as this book is complete excrement. People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior. I feel i have already said enough."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Good story for a movie. In fact there was a movie set in the west during gold rush based on this story. Good, but I forget the movie title. Both are very believable, which I like."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],x={key:0},C={key:1};function M(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-7f3f21e7"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/22.md","filePath":"guide/22.md"}'),j={name:"guide/22.md"},O=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,O as default};
