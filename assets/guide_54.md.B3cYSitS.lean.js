A lot of the plot seems straight from a \\"How To Write A Fantasy Coming-Of-Age Epic Story\\" guide, but even so, I say the book is well-written, at least. I have read other books by people this age, and Eragon definately sounds the most mature, by far. My only real critique is that Eragon seems to become unconscious in almost every chapter of this book. So, I guess I would call it: good, but with flawed moments.Still, you have to admit it sounds a lot better than most teenagers' writing (I would know, I am one). And yes, I am going to buy Eldest when it comes out. (Sigh) I guess I sold out to The Man."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is the best one I have read so far!!It's very descriptive and emotional.

I can't wait till the next one in the trilogy"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm a new reader, I used to hate books and of course reading them as well. In fact I'm an Arabic guy, so you can imagine the big burden I went through that made me a regular reader despite the language difficulties and my hatred for books.This book was the main cause for my change and I'm really grateful for Christopher Paolini this wonderful piece of art! it took me three days to finish this book, and for me as I mentioned above, that is a MIRACLE! you can't imagine how much I yearn for The Eldest now, unfortunately I will be on a holiday back in my country when it comes out. But I will buy it as soon as I set my feet here back from my holiday.I can't deny the great amount of flowery words in each page. It gave me a headache using my dictionary to find out what they mean every minute, it was the main reason for taking three days reading the book. Sometimes I just found it unnecessary to use such words for simple things.However, it was worth it by all means and I enjoyed this book SOOOOOOO MUCH!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I reviewed this book about a month ago and I really stuck it to Paolini, and now after re-reading Eragon, I realize that I may have been a little too hard. This book and its author have enormous potential. Mr. Paolini never claimed that his book was a great novel; it became a bestseller on its own. Paolini clearly put alot of work into this, and I think that he deserves some respect for such an enormous task. I deffinately have read books that were worse than this one, and those books seem to be getting just as mutch attention as Eragon, yet nobody is bashing THEM!For those of you who actually enjoyed this book, I recommend The Sword of the Dragon Master, by Will Dantzler. It was also written by a teenager, though it is directed towards a younger audience than Eragon.Keep up the good work, Mr. Paolini, I'm looking forward to Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved the way this book was written I couldnt put it down!Buy it from amazon today!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Anyone who likes:Fariys,Giants,Elves,Shades,Urgals,Ra\`zacs and most important Dragons,will love this book.I did.It is the best book ever made."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"They forgot to mention Ursula K.

(Oh yeah, spoilers aplenty!)This book, as mentioned by another reviewer, is a complete rip-off of Star Wars. Eragorn (aka Luke Skywalker) lives in a quiet corner of the universe until one day his life is turned up-side-down when he finds out his destiny is to become a mighty Dragon Rider, better known to you and me as Jedi Knights. In fact, just in case you didn't get that little connection, it's emphasised in every possible way. Dragon Riders, like Jedi Knights, were peacekeepers in former years, but are now only a distant memory because one of them became too strong and decided to kill the others. His name was Darth Vader.Now, Eragon doesn't leave alone, oh no, he does so with a mysterious old man called, Brom, who predictably turns out to be none other than Obi-Wan Kenobi; the last remnant of the old Jed- I mean Dragon Riders. He teaches Eragon everything he needs to know before - and wait for this, you'll love it - they find out they have to rescue a damsel in distress. In this version she's some elf bird, but in another she's called Princess Leia. Right, am I forgetting anything? Oh wait! Naturally, Brom, like Obi-Wan, dies along the way.Now I'm not saying the rest of the story will continue in this way, but if one day I'm sitting with my duvet wrapped around me, a warm hot chocolate at my side and Eldest (the next book after Eragon) in my lap and I find out that Eragon runs into Yoda, or the main bad guy turns out to be Eragon's father, I might just be sick."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love Eragon it is the best book I have ever read.

Immediately, the name lured my imagination and I could wait no longer to pick it up. As I began reading this novel in a remote corner of the store on a small step stool, I understood from the first pages and chapters that this would be a book I would forever cherish. I have now read Eragon twice after owning it only less than 2 weeks, and leant it to fellow friends and family. Their responses were as enthusiastic, if not more than mine.Eragon is a book that will stand the test of time, passed from generation to generation with its story living strong. At the current moment, my mother is reading Eragon and with each page it captures more and more of her attention. My brother is impatiently waiting for her to finish reading it, but luckily for him it won't be long.Christopher Paolini, a teen himself, has proven to be one of the fantastic writers of this generation, but needless to say he will continue to be great for every generation.I am awaiting the arrival of 'Eldest' and perhaps a movie or two is on the way!

As a small child, I often lost myself in strange and enchanting worlds created by Lewis, MacDonald, L'Engle, and even the grandfather of fantasy himself, Tolkien. There was something magical about those stories that revealed the great wonder of adventure, and a sense of awe at the mysterious and unknown aspects of life. In Eragon, Mr. Paolini demonstrates the same ability to pull his reader in by weaving together a most thorough and captivating plot. All the classic elements of a fantasy are included: mystery, adventure, magic, swordsmanship, and a little romance. All this together, without adding too many extraneous details, results in a very grand adventure. Congratulations to Mr. Paolini on such a fine story; I am very anxious to read his next book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am not a fantasy buff. Did the author borrow from other writers of his genre while writing the Inheritance cycle (Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr, and Inheritance). Maybe. I can't say. What I can tell you is that this is a great story no matter whay type of books you usually like to read. It has adventure, action, fantasy (dragons, dwarves, elves, magic, etc.) war, love, mystery, and much more. You can really melt into this series for a couple of months and enjoy something new, if like me, you haven't read many fantasy books.When I am choosing a new book to read, what I really want to know is will this bring me entertainment? So here is a reviewer who is saying yes it will. Is this book worth the purchase? I think so.The writer was young when he began writing the series, so you might find some things about his writing style to pick at, like the fact that he drags things out a little too long and gives a bit too much description in the wrong places, but over all it is well written and tells a great story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love the whole series.

And the emotions that Eragon expresses; well, as I said, you can tell it was written by a kid because there's just no sophistication to the language or story telling. You'd be better off reading the Artemis Fowl series (fun and funny), of if you're older, the His Dark Materials series (sophisticated and thoughtprovoking)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't think I have to explain my point, I just think it was terrible, personally."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher is trying to create an elabrate world of destiny, magic, and dragons, the cover and introduction looked cool but the text was the corniest thing ever! cornier than any sitcom i've ever seen!!! i mean it had unneccasary chapters and stupid magic, no offense chris i appreciate the effort.

This is the kind of book that makes you want to truley BE in the story, being a saphire blue dragon in flying practice, or the normal farm boy, trying to hide the truth.The book is about a quiet farmboy named Eragon. When he hears an explosion in the forest where he is hunting, he discovers a blue rock at the explosion's site. He goes home, dissapointed that he didn't catch anything for the winter, and takes the rock with him, hoping it will sell for atleast a small amount of money.But, when everyone refuses to even touch this \\"rock\\", Eragon takes it home.

Christopher Paolini does an amazing job of really setting the story. All of the characters are deep and complex and the story follows an interesting plot line. Paolini built a marvelous story that kept my interest throughout it to the end. Its compelling characters and non predictable story kept me engrossed in it as I was reading and when I had finished I could not wait for the squeal to come out.Eragon starts out with a masterly done prologue that gets your interest and the story quickly sweeps up to keep it. The basic story is about a young man, Eragon, who finds a mysterious rock in the mountains. This rock turns out to be a dragon egg and Eragon is forced to flee his home for various reasons. The story continues from there always taking unimagined turns whether it is meeting an elf, learning about the ancient language or concluding with powerful political leaders always keeping the reader on edge. The story concludes with a dramatic cliffhanger that leaves you grasping for the next book. I believe that Christopher Paolini is one of the next great fantasy authors and I encourage anyone who likes fantasy books to read it. I hope this helped you in making the choice to buy this book or not."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great book for all the people that love adventure and midievil books. This book is a great way to blow by time and a great for people like me that don't like to read. Eargon gives Lord of the Rings a bad name. First of all, Eargon is very easy to follow and it's not one of those books that you have to read two times to understand. This book is also not that long and very easy to pick up and get into. One of the best things about this book is that there is a perfect amount of action, adventure, and enough twists in this book to make you love it. One of the last things that is great about this book is that it gives you the feeling that you owned a dragon and you did all of these adventures with it. If you love adventure books and hate to read, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first started reading Eragon, I couldn't stop reading it. Eragon is a satisfaction guaranteed. Eragon is FULL of action and adventure. Even people who hate reading will LOVE reading this ADVENTURE PACKED story. STORY DESCRIPTION:The story is about an orphan farm boy named Eragon who lives with his uncle and his cousin. One day he finds a \\"stone\\" while hunting, he tries to figure out what it is with the help of a story-teller/dragon rider. One day the \\"stone\\" (which is really an egg) hatches and a dragon comes out (he names it Saphira). They have a lot of adventures together."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There are several parallels between this book and Star Wars (as well as Middle Earth and Harry Potter), but Paolini does a great job of creating a realistic world with a rich backstory. I truly enjoyed watching Eragon grow through his different relationships with Saphira, Brom, Murtagh, and Arya. He truly grows from a boy at the beginning of the book to a almost a man by the end of the book. Eragon has a clearly defined sense of right and wrong, and while occasionally takes some rash acts, it's always in defense of someone else. This is a young man you would want at your back in a fight and definitely someone you want to get to know. I'll enjoy reading the rest of the series because of the strength of the main character. One small weakness of Paolini is his lack of dialogue. Rather than state that Saphira and Eragon had a conversation, I would like to read the conversation so I could get a better feel for their relationship. This is a good, solid book that I would recommend for any fan of dragons and magic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, by far, was the best action/adventure book that I've read. It was kind of gory and has quite a bit of blood and destruction. Eragon takes place in a kind of midevil time with dragons, potions, witches/wizards, dwarfs, elves, and swords. Alagaesia, the empire in which Eragon and Saphera live, kind of resembles Alaska as far as the placement of mountians and oceans. Alagaesia even has the shape og Alaska. Anyway, Eragon takes a long journey around Alagaesia chasing the Razac(dark creatures that bring death and dispear, they also killed Eragons uncle)with his companion, Brom. Brom was killed by the Razac when he was found. Eragon's new companion was the son of a forsworn rider. The three(don't forget Saphera) Made their way to the varden. The Varden is a very peaceful place in the mountians outside of the empire. It origanlly belonged and was carved by the dwarfs. The finest marble and the largest precious stones that you'll ever 'see'. When they least expect it, the varden is attacked by the kull, very large and strong urgals controlled by the shade. The shade is a evil wizard like guy that Eragon must defeat. The bad thing is, the shade is the most powerful being on the planet and only 2 people in all of the peoples living days have fought aganst a shade and lived. Eragon is facing the bigest life and death situation of his life.... Suddenly, Saphera burst out of the dragon hold and distracted the shade. Eragon gets a good shotat the heart and the shades mind. He makes a stab with his sword, hits the target, and watches the shade vaporize into nowhere. The shade is dead.I reccomend this book for boys mostly because of all of the blood and stuff girls might not like, but haygirls, im not stoppin you from reading it!! Also, if you are like me and only are intrested in action/adventure series books, read on!!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a well-paced fantasy/adventure novel. The main character is a 16-year-old named Eragon. Eragon lives with his cousin Roran, and his uncle Garrow, in a town called Carvahall. Eragon finds a dragon egg, and names his female dragon Saphira. He and a former dragon rider, Brom sets out to find the Varden, so they can find safety from the evil king Gallabratrix, who also has a dragon.Once Brom and Eragon decide to leave, two strange creatures called the Ra'zak appear in Carvahall, looking for Eragon. The Ra'zak kill one of Eragons family members. (wich one I wont say). Quickly Eragon and Brom start a search for the Ra'zak. Along the way Eragon learns to be a deadly swordsman and to be a strong magician, while there rinding through the sesert. they Finally corner the Ra'zak in a city called hellgrind. But they end up ambushing Eragon! Even though Eragon is a powerful swordsman, the Ra'zak can easily overpower the strongest of humans. They captured Eragon and Brom. And then a stranger named Murtaugh comes and saves Eragon and Brom. Even though they were saved, they both had bad injuries. Eragon ha a broken rib and Brom had a horrible cut that might be his last.That's is far as I will go, because I want you to read the book yourself. Eragon is appropriate for both males and females. I absolutely love this book. I've read it about three times. This book is exciting and its so good that you don't want to put it down.If you're into the Fantasy/Adventure kind of book, you, really enjoy this book.

I have taken a break from novel reading for a while, after ploughing through the Brooks Shannara series, the Feist Riftwar/Serpentwar sagas and the Belgariad by Eddings. These book collections contain some of my favourite fantasy books of all time.It was refreshing to read this book, which as some reviewers mention, was influenced heavily by some of the best fantasy fiction writers around. To some this may appear to be nothing more than a knock-off; taking plot lines from various authors and mixing them together, creating something inferior than the sum of the initial parts. If you are a purist, I can understand that position and the quest for something unique in this genre.For myself on the other hand, I read as though looking for something enjoyable. Thankfully in this case I was pleasantly surprised, and really got in to the book, reading it in 2 days! I didn't even know about the hype of his age until I saw the brief bio at the end and the picture.This series is the story of a young boy, called Eragon. A village lad who finds a shiny gem in the mountains/forest one day, which turns out to be a dragon egg. As we discover more about Alagaesia and the Empire ruled by the cruel King Galbatorix, last of the Dragon Riders, corrupt and inhuman. That is of course until the dragon egg hatches, and the baby dragon becomes connected to Eragon. He names her Saphira, and then the fun begins.As their bond becomes deeper, we find out that there are many malevolent forces seeking to destroy the people, and control the whole known world. Not only that, but King Galbatorix systematically wiped out the Dragon Riders, apart from those under his direct control. There were none for a long time, and any that happened by chance - due to the fact that the dragon chooses their bond partner - were given the choice to either serve him, or die.Eragon is in trouble, and does not have the skills necessary to defend himself or those he loves.

I'll never be able to finish it.\\" And so I picked up the book, sat on my bed and started to read. It was like a whole new adventure with every changing chapter that I got through reading. The book would calm down for a chapter and then suddenly new people would come to life and appear in the story. I could not believe it. I was half way through the book! Now I have started on the second book and I can't wait to finish it so I can go on to the next adventure.I rate this magnificent book 4,1/2 stars. Go to the closest library and get this book! NOW!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For some reason, every time a teenager has a glimpse of success, the world at large feels that it's their duty to insult, cut-down, find flaws in or belittle that achievement. Eragon has been compared to Star Wars, LOTR, Dragon Hunters, and The Wheel of Time. Each and every time the reviewer or critic will claim that the obvious similarities between the works of fiction is a flaw rather than an archetype.What people don't seem to understand is that in archetypal fiction, the work is expected to have similiarites to its brother tales. Some of the similarites I would say are ridiculous to start off with. (Comparing Eragon's triumph over the Shade Durza to the destruction of the Death Star.)But what is almost ridiculous is how biased and narrow-minded people have become. If you look at JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series (I have the deepest respect for this author as well by the way) you will see so many similaritites to the epic poem Beowulf or even the original work of his colleague and friend C.S Lewis that if inclined to do so, one could make him out to be the plagarist of the century. Which of course he is not! But Tolkien openly claims to have been influenced in no small part by Beowulf and other Norse and Old English stories.Have any of you heard the saying, \\"There is nothing new under the sun?\\"As for Robert Jordan's wheel of time... Trollocs: Orcs, Fades: Nazgul, Rand: Frodo crossed with Boromir etc... The list goes on and on, yet I don't see people hating his work!So LAY OFF!Eragon itself was one of the best paced stories I've read in a long time. Christopher Paolini's narrative voice is both convincing and captivating. The story is a perfect blend of action, adventure, romance and self-discovery. His protagonist, Eragon (Dragon with the first letter changed) is both believable and admirable in his actions as well as inactions.Honestly I can't wait until the next installment in the series comes out. I would definitely liken the Inheritance Cycle to works such as LOTR and maybe even Star Wars, but I would say this was a pro rather than a con. We all loved those stories didn't we? Why can't we enjoy a story that picks up the proverbial baton where Mr. Tolkien left off? I personally think if you read this story with an unbiased mind and a love for fantasy; you will not be dissapointed!(By the way, he does NOT write like a teenager. I know words aren't everything, but using 'tenebrous', 'supercillious', 'carentan', 'scintilating', and perfidious- to name a few- in the correct form, definitely impressed me!) I hope you enjoy Mr. Paolini's series as much as I have."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, takes place in a world of fantasy, where dragons and elves are an important part of a battle.Eragon is a 15-year-old boy who lives with his uncle Garrow, and his cousin Roran. Eragon was out hunting in The Spine. Eragon had been looking after a herd of deer for days. As he was coming across a valley he found a large purple stone.shaped like an egg.He went back home and showed his family the stone. They wondered if it had any worth, so they could sell it to buy food.One night, Eragon heard a horrible screeching noise. They stone that he had found was rattling on the shelf where he had placed it. All of a sudden the stone started to crack, and then a little tiny dragon's head popped out. Eragon now realized he had a dragon egg, not a stone.He names her Saphira. Eragon knew how dangerous owning a dragon was, but he wanted to keep it so much.Soon Eragon comes to be best of friends with the dragon. Over time the dragon grows, bigger and bigger.Eragon comes home to find his home destroyed and his uncle killed. He finds out that it was caused by the Ra'zac, people who work for the king and the empire.

However, I have read most of it.I am an unpublished child writer, and I think that, although Mr. Paolini is not the next J.K. Rowling, he shows a considerate amount of talent for his age.Sure, some of the ideas have been taken from Lord of The Rings and other famous fantasies, but almost all books borrow a little bit.I think people hear \\"child writer\\" and they look for extra reasons why the book might be bad. Like, \\"Oh, he's only fifteen, I bet this book sucks.\\"If you want to enjoy the book (which I am doing) I don't think you should think of Mr. Paolini as a \\"kid\\" because you will interpret his writing as a \\"kid's work\\".Overall, this is a decent book with some interesting ideas and some fairly good writing. I would recomend this for anyone under 20.Maybe don't buy this book because you (like many others) may not like it, but I would definitely reccomend borrowing it from the library or from a friend and give it a shot!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The story was a wonderful read, very enjoyable and a strong representation for the genre. The best part, in my opinion, is it started with an original premise -- a young boy finds a dragon egg and is forced to deal with its sudden hatching. In many ways, this is also a coming of age story with strong moral grounding and moments of surprising depth.A number of other reviewers have criticized this book for ripping off everyone from Lewis, to Tolkien, to McCaffrey and everyone in between. I did not find this to be the case. A writer who follows the path of other writers and writes from inspiration and admiration of those writers' styles is decidedly not, in my opinion, ripping them off. The wonderful thing about the genre that Tolkien and others created is that it is vast enough for a great number of stories inspired by myth, Tolkien, the others, or some combination.As for elves, dragons, dwarves and the rest, they are no less cliche to me than creatures in the real world. Is a human a cliche? One may as well critique the human unconscious which seems to have patterned these things into our very dreams. I for one, and the big kid in me, love these creatures and I will never tire of them.That is not to say that one should not strive for originality in story. But originality in story is entirely different from the clothing it wears. In my opinion, some of you out there need to remove the reality from your fantasy and just have fun. You cannot critique fantasy and mythic tales in the same way you would critique literature. Myth, by its very nature, is additive and inspirational -- not iconoclastic. Bly and Jung had it right. We are dealing in archetypes here. Get rid of characters like Gandalf, Dumbledore, Obi Wan Kenobe??? May as well say get rid of 'wise mentors' altogether.I would say that what is tired is not this story, but the criticism mounted against it. If you read the reviews for Tolkien, Lewis, Nix, Alexander, Rowlings and a hundred others you will find similar critiques along with loud cries of 'derivation!' and even 'plagiarism!' It is obvious that a number of you achieved very high marks in Cynicism 101. What you seem to lack are the dreams and clarity of vision this writer achieved which led him to create something extraordinary, beautiful, and popular.More a critique of the critics than of Eragon, I know. But someone has to clear the goblins out from time to time.My best wishes to you all and to Mr. Paolini -- a tip of the hat sir. I wish I had started so young and full of promise. But it seems I must make my own struggling way -- goblins be damned.Rob Fanney"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought the book was great because it got into the story fast and the action never stopped and the characters were more real than other books I've because they were not as invicible.

As he about to shoot an arrow, an explosion occurs. He checks and in the midst of where his prey was resides a blue stone with white lines on it. The gem soon hatches into a noisy sapphire blue dragon. Receiving guidance from the village storyteller, the teen raises his new companion that he names Saphira.King Galbatorix wants the dragon and its owner working for him. His evil followers murder Eragon's uncle and go after the lad. Eragon and Saphira flee. On the run, they learn to fight as one and study magic in an attempt for the lad and his dragon to become the first Dragon Rider in a century. If successful with the first stage of their quest, they will attempt to avenge the killing of his family and free the Empire from the monarch and his malevolent minions.Clearly paying homage to Beowulf and of course Tolkien, Christopher Paolini provides a powerful epic fantasy. The tale stars a delightful coming of age hero, a dragon, a mentor, and an assortment of human and otherworldly evil essences. Though adjusting to the proper names of places and people can prove difficult (thank goodness for a listing and a map), the fast-paced story line is action-packed so that readers gain a strong novel that tells part of the tale (sequels to follow). Lord of the Ring fans of all ages will appreciate Christopher Paolini's terrific tale and look forward to the sequel in the Inheritance Trilogy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this book is ok for younger kids i guess, but too much is just ripped of of Lord of the Rings to call it original. it basically is Lord of the Rings with majorly unnecessary descriptions and less characters, all of which are unoriginal and boring.

The author didn't have to do very much description of his fantasy world because all the players were \\"borrowed\\" from other authors' worlds --- especially Tolkien's. Paolini didn't have to explain the relationship between elves & humans & dwarves, since Tolkien fans already know all that. Fine; it's fan-fiction. But I was very disappointed that Paolini didn't give Tolkien a mention in his Acknowledgements section.Paolini even tried to mimic LotR by including some \\"translated\\" elvish poetry. That was by far the most embarrassing part of this book. Prose was stilted (really needed some professional editing), but the poetry was just . . . awful.

But I would not pay money for it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was one of the best I've ever read, but it was very long. I really like Eragon because it was challenging. I liked the plot twists, because they were foreshadowed, but they weren't given away. I actually didn't know what would happen, unlike with most books. I thought that it was an excellent read, but not meant for people who can put a book down for long periods of time.The beginning is about a teenage boy named Eragon, who lives with his uncle and cousin. He doesn't know who his parents are, and he has always wondered. One day, when he was hunting in the Spine, which are enchanted mountains that most are afraid of, he heard a loud bang. In the middle of a clearing, he saw a large blue stone with purple veins of a different type of stone. He didn't catch anything that day, so he brought the stone home to see if he could sell it. He showed it to the town storyteller, Brom, to see if he could tell how much it was worth. Brom got a strange look on his face, and the boy wondered why.A few nights later, he heard a tapping. He got out his bow and walked around, but he realized that the noise was coming from the stone. The stone broke open, and a baby dragon came out. She marked Eragon with the gedwey ignasia, or the shining palm, when he touched her. This showed that he could do magic. He named the baby Saphira. This dragon birth led to a chain of events that changed Eragon completely. His uncle was murdered by the Raz'ac, an evil group of flying demons sent by the king, Galbotorix. Eragon became a dragon rider because of the gedwey ignasia, also. The dragon riders had been extinct for years, because no eggs would hatch for Galbotorix. Dragons choose whom they hatch for, and since Galbotorix was evil, they wouldn't come out of their shells for him. Brom and Eragon went on a wild ride, and where soon joined by Murtagh, the son of Morzan, an evil man. Murtagh was not evil, though, he was kind. Their ride continued on, and they realized that they were being followed by Urgals, who were giant beasts that made up Galbotorix's army.They fled to the Varden, where they could be safe. The Varden were people who lived underground and were very much against Galbotorix. Eragon had been practicing magic a lot, and he had become one of the strongest magicians. A war broke out between the Urgals and Varden, because Galbotorix wanted Saphira for himself. Eragon helped the Varden, but was mortally wounded. What will happen next? You'll have to read Eragon to find out.I think that you should read this book because the author wrote it so that it appeals to everyone. Whether you like fantasy or not, this book has something for you. If you like to study languages, this book has many languages of its own.

This is one of the first book sI have ever read that introduced a new type of createure besides the usual ogre, giants, and witches. Saphira has a great personality and helps Eragon along in the best way possible. Though Eragon felt a little ddistant to me, he is not a very complex character that I think Paolini needs to work on.

Entertainment. Nothing more, really. Is that so hard to understand?So, when I read Eragon, as the book's plot began to unfold, I was thrilled. It was an excellent book. I didn't deny that there were a great many aspects which seemed to have been pulled right from the Lord of the Rings. I says to myself, I says, \\"Hey, me, who cares?

It borrows heavily from the fantasy genre, but within the story are good political dynamics between the factions. The author did tend to show his age specifically so with romantics relationships it tries to capture between the hero and a female elf. The voice author is fantastic. The reason I gave it three stars is because one whole chapter was inaudible. Amazon granted me a free replacement, but the same chapter same problem. Until this day I don't know what happened in that chapter."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a good book for people who like fantasies. However, it is very long.

Don't pass this book up!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is a good, though light, read. Yes it is long, but this is not a novel that you'll have to put down to think through and comprehend passages. If you've read any of Tolkien, McAffrey, Le Guin, Eddings, or even seen Star Wars in passing, most, if not all, of Eragon will seem familiar.The problem with the book is, a lot of it IS familiar. The orphaned farm boy Luke... no, Garion..... no, Eragon, who suddenly finds himself enemy of the Empire.. well, Empire... and travels with a crotchety old man Obi-Wan... no, Belgarath..... no, Brom, who has mysterious knowledge about all things... You see where this is going.There's very little in this book that can be called 'original'. The dwarves are as you've seen in Tolkien, workers of stone, living in mountains and so on. Elves are what you'd expect from Tolkien as well, the ultimate beings in the world. The humans are fickle, easily swayed by power, passion, corruption. The orcs/goblins/urgals/ugly critters du jour are just what you'd expect. That which is fair is good, that which is ugly is evil. Surprised? No? Moving on then...So, a new twist on dragons? Well... not so much. Read any of the Dragonriders of Pern, which are excellent books, and there you'll find Paolini's dragons. Very nearly identical. Dragons linked to one individual, telepathic, empathic, wise beyond their years, impish, wry humor. Where McAffrey's dragons can teleport, Paolini's have magic. Hey, there's one difference! Wait.. dragons that have/are/use magic? Dungeons and Dragons anyone? Dragonlance? Ah, there it is! Small changes, small changes.Let us press on...Magic, controlled by an 'ancient, true language' all things know. Your 'true name' can control you utterly. LeGuin!! There you are, mostly. More small changes.Eddings you say? Well, the magic requires power from the caster, from all around, and requires a word to be released. The Will and the Word. Except the words are just the ancient language. Well that IS familiar, but a little different. More small changes.You see how it is with this book. One could go on and on I'm sure.It could be said epic storytelling has been a rehash of the same ideas since before the days of Ulysses and the Iliad. Sure, Tolkien did it perhaps better than most, but even he wasn't the first.However, credit must be given where it is due, and the author has woven several disparate thematic ideas together very well. The ideas blend together smoothly, indicative the author did put quite a bit of thought and effort behind the tale. Taken as it is, written by a teenager, this is an excellent work. Read through the eyes of a fantasy reader (teenage) this is terrific. All those adolescent 'what if' questions thrown into one grand tale. Eddings' hero Belgarion, astride a Dragon of Pern, given chance to fight through Tolkien's evil orcs and goblin, to tackle Darth Vader and the EEEEEEVIL EMPIRE! How could you go wrong?Read through the eyes of the more jaded, cynical, adult reader, the question becomes, how did this get past an editor? It's certainly not drivel, by any means, but whole concepts have been lifted entire from other works with little or no changing done at all.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Eragon, and I imagine I'll enjoy the other two books as well. I'm interested in seeing what Paolini comes up with that is truly, originally HIS, not derived from other, older, more experienced authors.But, I enjoyed Eragon because it felt familiar. I'd read almost this exact story several times, and liked reading it. You know there are those good books you can go back and read, reread, and keep reading over and over. Reading Eragon is like that. If some parts seem familiar, they will be. But, don't get angry that you haven't seen them in so long, give them a big hello, and find out what they've been up to. In some cases, you'll find it's not what you expected."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Book Review for Eragon by Christopher PaoliniThis is a book about a farmer named Eragon. He finds an egg after its protector, Arya the elf, gets attacked. After he finds the egg, his Uncle Garrow is murdered. When the egg hatches into a dragon, the town storyteller, Brom, offers to trains Eragon to be the next Dragon Rider. Eragon fights many battles with his dragon, Saphira, and learns to use magic in his quest to reach the rebelling Varden, who fight the evil king, Galbatorix. Do not pass this one by!I would say that the characters in this book are pretty believable. I can connect with some of them pretty well. Brom trains Eragon, the last Dragon Rider, to fight with Saphira, his dragon, by his side. Later on in the book, Murtagh, who befriends Eragon, joins them. Throughout their quest, they get into many pitched battles with Urgals, which are evil creatures under Galbatorix's command. Sometimes its close, but they always make it through.This terrific book is basically a journey across the mystical world of Algaesia. They go through many towns and cities to evade the pursuing Urgals. They also traverse the grand Hadarac Desert and the du Weldenvarden, which is a giant forest, in their quest to reach the Varden.I think that friendship is the name of the game in Eragon. The strong love that binds Eragon and Saphira stays with them throughout the book. Saphira has saved Eragon's life many times, like Eragon has done for her.If you like action and adventures, I suggest you read Christopher Paolini's book. With great descriptions, but some challenging words, I recommend this book for grades 4-8."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I purchased this book because my 12-, 11- and 10-year-old grandsons have loved it and I wanted to know what was going on before I saw the movie with them. I am a long-time fan of Anne McCaffrey's books and the Harry Potter series, so I have some experience with good writing of this genre.I found it amazing that \\"Eragon\\" was authored by such a young man; he refers to a wide range of background information. I would like to believe this is due to the fact that he was home-schooled and has been exposed to more literature than public schools have time to cover. Christopher Paolini has conceived such an amazing world and populated it with such a variety of beings that I am in awe of his talent. What an imagination!On the other hand, the story often reads like it was written by a very young person. Frequently an obscure word seemed to be \\"inserted\\"; that broke up the flow of the story and made it seem like \\"I learned a new word today.\\" The same could be said about some of the details. The wording was occasionally reminiscent of other well-known books.I do not know how the publishing process works; perhaps all books start out like this and are polished during the professional editing process. The second book in the series, \\"Eldest\\", was even more enjoyable and I am looking forward to book #3.Frankly, the book would have to be pretty bad for me to not like it. It has continued my grandsons' love of reading and introduced them to the wide-ranging background information I mentioned above.

Paolini has raw, unrefined talent and an undeniable flair for writing, but he's bogged down by every fantasy cliche in the book, and a style that desperately needs an editor's guidance.Eragon is an impoverished lad living with his uncle in a secluded village, barely scraping by. That changes when he finds a strange blue stone in the woods. He tries to sell it, with no luck -- it's harder than diamond, and no one knows what it is. Then it hatches -- into a baby dragon. When Eragon touches her, he accidently burns a scar into his hand and forms a mental bond that allows them to communicate without speaking.He raises the dragon in secret, naming her Sephira, until his farm is attacked and his uncle Garrow murdered by the evil minions of the ex-Dragonrider Galbatorix, who is now the evil king.

However, once I got into the book, I discovered it was a rip of many other books of the fantasy genre -- a sort of melding of a lot of other books. For example, comparing it to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, in Eregon Shades are the equivalent of Fades (even the names are similar), the Forsworn are once powerful men who become corrupted in Eragon, just the same as the Forsaken in the Wheel of Time. And the similarities with other books don't end there.The character development is weak. Eragon changes from a mild mannered boy into a moody independent teenager overnight and seemingly aquires skills without effort. His dragon hatches and is sarcastic in a couple short months. Brom plays hide the ball about his past and skills to a point where nobody in their right mind would trust him. In the end, the characters are so unbelievable as to be the main failing in the book.Finally, the story is very predictable with little suspense. It ambles along in a we did this, then did that narrative fashion. If you are a fantasy reader familiar with many of the other big authors, this book will be a let down, despite its intriguing basic story line.Despite all that, the writing is fine for a technical viewpoint. Places and things are well described and no more verbose than necessary to paint a picture. Thus, this book merits more than one star, but no more than two."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After hearing that this book was going to be made into a big budget movie, I thought to myself, 'hey, it must be pretty good,' and borrowed it. I kinda regret it now - this book is clich&eacute;d, poorly written, bland, wooden, and painful to read. (Sorry this is so harsh, but it really is!)That aside, you have to congratulate Chris for having attempted to write an epic - he just shouldn't have published it. When you consider he was only 15 when he started this book, of course he's going to lack the experience and maturity of authors such as Pullman, Rowling and Tolkien. If he had attempted to publish his work in maybe ten years or so I think there's no doubt he'd have done well. It's thanks to a lucky coincidence that... his parents own the publishing company!!! If Chris had no help from this fact, and sent his book somewhere else, I think there's no doubt that it would not have been published. He's definitely got the talent, but he's not distinguished author material yet.I'm 15 myself, and even I can pick out the bad dialogue and writing. I remember once in English class, we learnt of the 'Show, don't Tell' concept. I'm afraid Chris tells an awful lot. If someone said 'The footy team punched the air at the end of the match,' he'd say 'The footy team won.' Go through the book and almost every sentence tells, e.g. 'they trotted quietly around the town and entered it cautiously'. It completely bores the readers thirst for words and leaves nothing for their imagination to create.The characters aren't exactly solid either. Try and describe the characteristics of Eragon. He's...what? Brave? Stubborn? Weak? To me, he has nothing that makes him a strong or bold, outrageously different character. He's simply a 15 year old guy that does what everyone tells him. Every successful book I've ever read has a main character that is strong in their ways. Take a look at His Dark Materials. Lyra is stubborn, fierce and proud. Ditto Harry Potter - he's a rule breaker, he's determined, and he's pretty courageous too. How about his best bud Ron? He can be a bit of a scaredy-cat, he's a little clumsy, but he's loveable all the same.Eragon shows way too much of the stereotypical. There's Brom, the wise old guide, you know, the hobbling one with the wispy beard and walking stick, Arya, the beautiful but feisty maiden, King Galbatorix, the evil overlord. And immortal elves dwindling in number? Dwarves that hide from the world in cavernous mountains? Huge evil guys with primitive ways? Mr Tolkien must be spinning in his grave!!!This is probably the harshest review of anything that I've ever written, but I think gaining credit by stealing noticeably huge chunks from other authors isn't the most honest way to become one yourself.I feel kinda cruel writing this review, but I'm glad that there's other people who agree! All the same, I'll give Chris 2 stars - one for trying (I guess you shouldn't completely crucify his work considering he was 15 at the time of writing!), and one for the scrap of talent that will hopefully get bigger as he writes more books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ERAGON has joined my favorites shelf for a long time.

The public just wouldn't accept it.Despite the resemblence to Tolkien and the names, which were, yes, very much like those of the LOTR's, I really loved this book. The story keeps you reading, and in fact, my only complaint about the actually narration and the events is that Eragon tends to black out way too much. I felt like every other chapter began with &quot;as Eragon blinked and opened his eyes...&quot; or ended with &quot;and suddenly it all went black.&quot;Otherwise, a highly entertaining read...I attribute the &quot;copycatting&quot; of other authors as just a sort of respect andlooking-up-to to them.

I must say I'm disappointed. Even ignoring the rip-off factor, it was still disappointing. I don't think the author played to the stregnth of the story very well. This is a Dragon book, right? But for large portions of the book the dragon is little more than a pack animal that occasionally acts like a teenage girl, it just doesn't seem to make sense. The dialogue between the dragon and the boy is almost painfully cheesy and really underwhelms. This is definitely more of a teen or pre-teen kind of fantasy.That's not to say there are no positives. The Brom and Murdaugh characters are reasonably interesting, and managed to get me through it. After a tedious middle, it does pick up towards the end, but it's kind of too little, too late. I will say that the author has at least left himself a strong enough base that if he decides to get away from the Star Wars plot he could do something decent with it. After all, he is young and could be expected to improve as he gets older.Anyway, I'm not planning on reading part 2, though my friend may talk me into it.

I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is, unfortunately, all too derivative of some much better fantasies: Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Earthsea, Dragonrider, etc. It's stocked with the traditional elves, dwarves, wizards, swords of power, an apparently invincible evil overlord and his henchmen, and mind-melding dragons. As dressing, the prose of this book was in dire need of a blue pencil, as far too often it shoots into the stratosphere of purple and clich&eacute;d prose - whenever I run into things like 'noble steeds' I have to query if the editor was even at his desk when the manuscript crossed it.There are some flashes of originality here: The description of Eragon's farm life and his local villagers reads very well, the insectoid Ra'zak are a different kind of foe, Eragon's initial motivation for leaving his home rings true, his dream connection to Arya is a different method of tying the protagonist to deeper plot machinations, the herbalist Angela and the were-cats provide some welcome relief from all the traditional character types, and his rule of magic that magical feats take just as much energy to perform as what it would take to physically perform the action (at least he doesn't violate the Law of Conservation of Energy). But these good points are almost totally buried underneath a plodding and predictable plot, very bland (despite the purple prose) descriptions of the countryside and cities, and stereotypical and mainly (other than Eragon and Brom) flat characters.I was drawn to reading this from seeing the movie, as it was clear that there was more to the story than just what the screen action depicted, and was hoping to find a real world that I could immerse myself in, fully delineated and peopled with real people and a vital history. I didn't find it.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Yes, as I've been told by fans I know time and again, writing a bestseller at the age of 17 (or 15, as i've also heard it) is impressive. But, like the Da Vinci Code, it's been a lot of hype about something that isn't especially fantastic.Granted, Eragon isn't terrible; it has a decent, if predictable storyline (probably because the story was lifted almost directly from Star Wars Episode 4, the \\"first\\" one, for non-fans, and most of the characters are the token brigade found in almost any classic fantasy story... the reluctant hero, the warrior-princess, the wise old wizard, the rouge with a heart of gold, the elf/dwarf sidekick and the evil emperor). But unlike Lord of the Rings or Star Wars, Eragon reads more like a Scifi Original Movie than a fantasy epic; the characters are hardly developed, and the writing is juvenille at times.You have to applaud Paolini for making the effort, but he shouldn't have been given a publishing deal until he was a bit older, and had a chance to improve his writing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"All right, so I am an avid fantasy reader and I fully admit that the above reviews are correct in that Paolini borrows somewhat heavily from other novelists. I'm glad to see that I wasn't the only one thinking of star wars when they heard about the empire!However, I don't think that his borrowing is too egregious. As one of the reviews pointed out, his explanation of dwarves and elves fits the typical patterns of Tolkien, but since Tolkien essentially created the fantasy genre and certainly created the elves as we think of them today, this \\"borrowing\\" is simply the use of modern day conceptions of those creatures. I think you can hardly blame him for the fact that great authors like Tolkien came before him and set the stage which he is somewhat forced to play from.Furthermore, while it's true that McCaffrey is probably the most notable example of the use of telepathic dragons, one can hardly blame him for using it when the concept of dragons literally speaking a human language stretches the suspension of disbelief a bit too far and when many other authors like Andrew Norton and Mercedes Lackey have also employed the idea of telepathic speech in dragons! Furthermore, his story for why the dragon riders came to exist is somewhat unique.I suppose the point of this review is simply to say that yes, if you've read fantasy you'll definitely see hints of your other favorite authors. However, I don't think it was noticeable enough to damage the story or to cause me any difficulty in enjoyment.Ultimately, it's difficult to criticize this author for using an almagation of readily available and somewhat public concepts of creatures that have become expected in our fantasy society today. Yes the author is yound and new and it shows. But don't single him out when hundreds of other authors \\"borrow\\" as well. Paolini has still given us a fun and interesting story with a lot of originality!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is amazing! I could not put it down at all.

We all know that Tolkien tapped into what is at the heart of most fantasy fiction, but all he did was shape a story from the myths and legends that were already firmly embedded in folklore. And where myth is concerned, there is always the same themes repeated again and again no matter what culture bares its origin. They are archetypal stories about the nature of humanity.As far as pure story, comparing Eragon to Lord of the Rings is like comparing Star Wars to Star Trek. Yes they are similar in genre, but the characters, motivations, plot lines and overall visions are very different.As for Eragon, it is a great story that I really enjoyed. It is filled with adventure and action and good characters. It had a good flow and some good surprises. I am really looking forward to the next two installments of this trilogy.I have to agree with the one reviewer who said the main character, Eragon, did manage to fall unconscious a little too much, especially in the first half of the book. But I think this is part of the overall story of him still being young and not yet as powerful as he is to become as the series continues.In any event this is a very good book, get it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Alot of kids in my class said \\"read this book, It's great!\\" So, I bought it at my local book store and started reading. It is a great book, and there is a big contrast with the characters. But, a couple dissapointed me. (...). Third, Paolini described everyones feeling in an argument angry. He should have a bigger vocabulary of the word Angry such as dissapointed,annoyed, frustrated, anything I can think of. On the possitive side, it's a good book for a tone of fantasy readers, because it has all the basics of a good fantasy: Action, adventure, swordplay, magic, and, of course, Dragons!! out of all the characters, ithink that the best out of all of them was Durza, the shade. He isn't human, but he isn't your'e average stand still character. Normally, I like the bad guys and Durza is a great example of your average evil person."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I had just finished this book and found it as one of the best books I have ever read.

I could easily see the authors influences.... however it did not take away from the reading enjoyment I had of this book. first I loved the Characters. They had more depth then most books written today, and were likable, interesting, but not very complex... which is refreshing. Even though the book seems as though it was written with a younger target audience ( possibly due to the authors age) It did not deter from the story. Bottom line: This is a great book for those who are looking for an easy read and not into analyzing every detail, and picking apart this or that. If you want to get lost in an interesting story on your vacation relaxing.... this one is for you. advice: Do not analyze this book. Do not look for grammar mistakes or look for \\"rip-offs\\" or influences.

There is evil in it but what book nowadays doesn't have evil in it? The character Eragon and the dragon Saphira are fantastic and Christopher Paolini created them wonderfully. This is a book you won't regret reading and won't be able to put down.Absolutely thrilling!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"Eragon\\" is the first book in \\"The Inheritance Cycle\\", and I reread it in anticipation of the final book coming out in November 2011. I found this to be an enjoyable epic fantasy despite some clich&eacute;d story lines such as the human/elf/dwarf races, young boy growing up to become the hero, a group of rebels fighting against the tyranny of an evil king, a mysterious prophecy of the hero's future, etc. There is even a hint of romance that will be explored later in the series.This story centers around Eragon, a 15-year-old boy, and as the cover suggests, a blue dragon. Since this is the first book in what is now a four-volume cycle, there was a lot of time in training where both Eragon and the reader learn about how to use magic, the history of the Riders (humans and elves who form a bond with dragons), and the background on the two warring factions.I think \\"Eragon\\" is a good young adult read free of bad language and sexual scenes. It is a story where a young man must face the harsh realities of evil, take a stand, and serve the common good even at the risk of death."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this was exactly what i thought it would be. awesome! i enjoyed myself though this isnt usually the genre i read. i saw the movie and thought the book must be better-the movie was great by the way. or i just really like dragons and sword fighting-which i do. well...on that point im still guessing but nevertheless i wasnt disapointed one bit. so glad i read this. i have the second book Eldest and now i find that C.

I am extremely interested in reading 4th book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, at least I had a book to read that would put me to bed at night.This book took me an excruciating, long time to get through. I can plow through an 800 page book fairly quickly - but these 500 pages in particular were quite hard to get through. The short chapters gave me a good excuse to stop regularly.Don't get me wrong - I think this would be a great book for young adults who are just starting to read fantasy. Some parts did hold my interest; however, for someone who has been reading fantasy for over a decade it may be worth your time to go with a book with a little more substance.This book was recommended to me by a friend on the basis that I enjoyed Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Unfortunately, this book did not even hold a candle to either of those. I understand that Christopher Paolini was a young author when he wrote the book so it is guaranteed it will have a different feel, it just wasn't for me. I was definitely not engaged enough to be interested in picking up Eldest next.Long story short, in my opinion - If you're over the age of 15, grab something else."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Some authors show potential early on in their writing careers. Christopher Paolini was one of them. When \\"Eragon\\" hit the shelves in 2003, Paolini's age, the book's storyline, and his family's support and promotion launched his book and his writing career into high gear. It's an ambitious work--one with a story that appeals to many and a beginning to a career of talent.To me, that's why \\"Eragon\\" shouldn't have been published.Paolini has talent and potential. It's evident in the way he writes. He knows how to read details. He knows how to hold a reader's attention. But these things can't take the place of good fundamentals--not the least of which are growth and experience. If Paolini had spent a few years letting himself grow and learn, then the book as we see it now would be better. If you take enthusiasm and ideas, couple them with skill and fundamentals, and let time and experience set in, you have an author who shows potential to be great. But that didn't happen here. \\"Eragon\\" was self-published before it reached maturity, and the book makes its own case.Most of the characters are little more than a name, a description, and a role to play. Almost all of them have the same stilted Ye Olde English voice, and almost all of them were crafted to support Eragon's story. Eragon himself didn't receive the development and personality that every main character deserves; instead, he was created to keep Paolini's ideas going, and it reduced him to a collection of clich&eacute;s. Most passages with the elf Arya are filled with descriptions about her beauty, to the point where Paolini seems to be ogling her through his male characters. Minor characters are treated just as poorly; for example, we learn that Horst is the village blacksmith \\"with a great expanse of hairy muscular chest,\\" but we learn little else.The storyworld has more development behind it, but not much. Most of the ideas, characters, and plotlines come from today's good stories--Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Dragonriders of Pern, and every other coming-of-age and dragon story that springs to mind. Instead of changing ideas to make something new, Paolini took them as they were and gave some of them different names. He didn't go in-depth into his world, and it left a lot of clich&eacute;s, errors, and inconsistencies.Content aside, the book is a decent read, but not a great one. It starts out streamlined and focused, but it turns flowery and overdramatic as it goes on. A lot of sentences are filled with too many details, which slows the story down. For example, a sentence early on in the book says, \\"Katrina stepped out from behind Horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten copper.\\" A lot of descriptions are like that--just a lot of useless words. Others show off Paolini's attempts to sound poetic (\\"The sun rose the next morning in a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow\\"). Unfortunately, these details don't have any relevance to the story or the scenes, which slows the story even more.The biggest drawback I have is that the story is shallow. It's the same basic story that appears in most fantasy novels today: a teenager gets uprooted from his lowly home because he's chosen to save his homeland. Unfortunately, it doesn't have good characters to back it up, and everything in between plot points moves slowly. In between tense scenes, there's a lot of traveling and development of unnecessary details. It takes too long to get to a plot point that readers can see coming.The New York Times called \\"Eragon\\" an \\"authentic work of great talent,\\" but the book is neither authentic nor great. It takes the same basic story arc and puts in empty characters and excessive details. At the same time, it feels like the work of a kid who just wants to write and have fun, but if he had a little more time and a lot of practice, he and his debut could have been something really special. Kids and people new to fantasy may enjoy \\"Eragon,\\" but if they want a book that grows with them and gets better with time, take it from someone who used to love this series: it'll probably be a disappointment."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book has a nice pace.

After reading the first page, one can guess immediately that it was not written by an adult. Some may argue that it's very good for the writing of a teenager, but I must disagree. Every idea is a cliche. Every creature is noticeably familiar. Every event is predictable. The character development, though present, seemed very forced, as did most other aspects of the novel. I quickly became weary of the overdone descriptions and awkward dialogue and phrases. The standard elementary school rules of \\"show, don't tell\\" are violated all too often. Worst of all, Mr. Paolini didn't make me \\"care\\" about the characters, so the plot itself was worthless to me. Even as an avid reader, I honestly had to push myself to finish reading this.

I since I am in the middle of trying to write a book myself I find I get a lot of inspiration from my favorite authours, Tamora Pierce... and I find myself getting ideas from them although you vary them slightly. That is what Christopher Paolini has done with many books but for his first book it is very good. He wrote the book for children not adults who are going to pick apart with every little mistake and find everything that is bad with it. Now that there are so many fantasy books out there is it hard not to get an idea that doesn't have some relation with another book. I am not going to tell the story becuase there are 844 some reviews that do that already including an earlier one of mine. I think that many of the aldults that are trashing this book should realize that this is a children's fantasy book not some highly experienced authour that has written an adult's book. This is a truly good book that many children and adults will like. I have recommened this book to all my friends cousins, aunts, uncles, parents and they have all liked it so I think that if you look at it from a different point of view, not one of he copied Lord of the Rings and many other books and all those other negative comments but that this is his first book and he was only 15 when he started it you might enjoy it much better.

Derivative, unashamedly cliched and dull...sadly, it's all true. But one thing that keeps popping is the author's age. The fact is that blaming the poor quality of the writing on his youth is a bit of a cop out. If you can write well, you can write well no matter how old you are. Sure, you improve as you go along, but a novice writer who starts at the age of 30 can be just as bad as a novice who starts at 13.

Yes, it is a young adult book, and yes, many young adults enjoy it. But there are many who do not. The most important thing to consider when deciding whether or not to buy this book is what everyone says, adults and kids. Listen especially to the kids who don't like it, and listen to why they don't. So many echo the same complaints that adults do: its derivative nature and its awful writing. It SHOULD NOT matter under ANY circumstances whether or not the book is written for kids or adults, or both: children DESERVE and should demand the same quality of writing that adults do. Children are people, too, and in the post-Harry Potter world of publishing, quality fantasy should be expected and encouraged, regardless of the author's age.Quite simply, this book is the result of marketing genius: market a book to kids, written by a \\"kid,\\"-- although he was no longer a kid when it was finally published by an official publisher-- in a genre that's hot right now. But beneath the marketing hype is an awful book that only teaches kids that bad writing can lead to big bucks. I don't need to specify why the book is awful, as there are enough reviews that do so, I will just simply say that I have a Writer's Group and I'm using this book as an example of bad writing and the common mistakes that first time writers make in the hopes that my group can learn to avoid them.Oh, and about those librarians: I am one. In fact, I'm a children's/YA librarian who LOVES fantasy and reads it constantly. (I've read most of the classic children's fantasy series: Alexander's, Cooper's, Le Guin's, L'Engle's, Lewis', etc.) I've been reading fantasy since I was about 8 years old-- I'm 26 now-- and I know a bad book when I see one. I also have a BA in English with an emphasis in Writing. \\"Eragon\\" should never have seen the light of day. Christopher needs to go to college, sit in a writing class and have his work torn apart so that he can learn to overcome common mistakes and not copy others' work. I see miniscule glimmers of talent in his writing, but I think they are forever destroyed by this early success.In the end: look not to the reviewer, but to the review.

However, I will still go with my point of view, (as everyone does of their own opinion)that it to say, that the Inheritance series is one of my favorite series and is a must read!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've never read Lord of the Rings (or much high fantasy, really) or seen Star Wars and even I could tell this was a bad book. Eragon is a hard character to like, not because he isn't likeable, but because he isn't anything. He's very reactive.A 'stone' scares away his dinner so he keeps it. It hatches into a dragon so he keeps that, too. Brom tells him to leave after Ra'zac destroy his farm and he leaves. Arya tells him to get her the antidote for her poison and he does. The only thing Eragon does to advance the plot is go with single-minded determination to rescue Arya and, though noble, that would have killed him off if not for Murtagh.As for Arya, well, I'm not going to disagree with all the people who say she has no personality. She doesn't show up until the last part of the book and doesn't really say anything when she does show up. Eragon saves her and after that it'd be easy to forget about her if Eragon didn't keep musing on her beauty every five seconds. Arya is reserved, beautiful, and a good fighter. That's it. There's no depth here. There's no anything.Oh, wait. She wears leather! Explain that one to me, Paolini, because I thought elves didn't kill animals unnecessarily. Did she stumble across a half-dead cow and decide to put it out of its misery? Sorry, that's book two. Back to book one.Eragon's constant drooling over Arya did nothing but annoy me and the less she did, the more annoyed I became. To be honest, I'm hoping Paolini will stop using Eragon as a means to fulfill his wish of shaking up with a leather-wearing elf and pair Eragon off with Nasuada instead. Her role greatly expands in Book Two to the point where I think she'd make a very worthy partner for Eragon. And, after all, we don't know who her mother is so she could very well be royal...To sum it all up, Eragon was a bad book that I only plowed through because I had nothing else to read anyway. There's a nice, three-page summary of Eragon in the beginning of Eldest so I suggest you skip Eragon entirely and just start from Eldest. At least Eldest made it seem like Paolini put some actual effort into his writing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is really lame.

This story is full of action, it also reminds me somewhat of Harry Potter, related to its theme and style. You are able to get lost in the adventures that transpire within the book. It provides magic, mystery, battles, elves, monsterous guys, drangons, were cats, sorcerers, etc all within its pages.This is a must for all fantasy lovers, you will absolutely fall in love with this book. Astonishing is the fact that the author wrote Eragon at the tender age of 15. This is the first in the trilogy, next to follow in my blog is the review of Eldest which I will be posting next.I would recommend this to everyone of all age groups not just the young adults. You will enjoy this book, it is a beautiful story of adventure and will wisk you away, even after finishing the book you will be thinking about its characters.

Does it copy other books? Some of the underlying ideas are there yes, but it certainly doesn't seem stolen. What? The author read lots of fantasy and sci-fi and borrows some for his own? Lots of writers do that. Heck, Mr. Lucas did, though not from the same genre. I guess it's just more obvious in this book.The storytelling in Eragon is what pulled me along. No real surprises presented themselves, so I didn't think it was a great book, but still a good one. The only thing that really bothered me about Eragon is a scene where he gets overly punished (like a 15 year old??) for something that seemed reasonable in the context of the story.I feel that the next book, Eldest, builds on this book and the Inheritance is turning into one of my favorite series.

Marshall is homeschooled and worked very hard writing and typing his article today. Enjoy!Kvetha Fricia. (Greetings, Friend.)If you have seen Eragon but didn't read the books you'd probably think there's no need to read the book because you saw the movie. But here's the catch, you're wrong. If you read the book it gives you way more details about the real story behind it all. Even though I haven't even seen the movie, I know the books are better.Have you read the Harry Potter books and seen the movies? If you have, you would know the books give a lot more detail than the movies. My advice is to stop watching TV and playing video games and start reading the Eragon trilogy, by Christopher Paolini, because you have a long way to go!Summary: Book 1, EragonEragon, a 15 year old farm boy, found a big blue rock. One night, while he was sleeping, he was startled awake by tapping noises. He discovered it came from the rock, then all of a sudden it hatch into a dragon! Eragon discovered the rock was a dragon egg! Soon after he named her Saphira and becomes a legendary Dragon Rider! He then leaves his town to become an even stronger Dragon Rider and rescue the remaining dragon eggs, and defeat the evil Dragon Rider King, King Galbatorix!Summary: Book 2, EldestAfter defeating the Shade, Durza, Eragon awoke in a room for a healer to work on a victim, he remembered that Durza cut his back. He felt it and to his horror, a huge scar from his shoulder to his opposite hip was all that was left of the slash. Soon after he regained his strength he left to be trained by a Legendary Dragon Rider named Oromis and for his dragon, Saphira, to be trained by Oromis's legendary dragon, Glaedr.Se onr sverdar sitja hvass!

Technically it is classified as juvenile science fiction/fantasy novel, so that would explain why it seems to be a easy read. I got about fourth of the way into the book and decided that it had my interest enough to finish it, but I wasn't sure yet if I was going to actually enjoy the book. By the time I was half-way though the book, I was enjoying it.I don't know how to describe the plot other than it reminds me of Lord of the Rings meets Dungeons and Dragons, meetsKrull(now we are talking old school sci-fi and fantasy), meets Harry Potter, meets Star Wars. In my opinion, as strange as all of this sounds, Paolini actually pulls it off. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, so I won't give away any details.For those of you that enjoy sci-fi and fantasy books and movies but get frustrated with all of the \\"jargon\\", don't worry. There are fictional histories and languages in the world of Eragon, but unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, they are not nearly as difficult to follow. For the casual fan of the fantasy genre, works such as the Lord of the Rings can be draining at times. Eragon keeps it simple but interesting. It even includes a \\"glossary\\" in the back of the book to help you if you do get lost.Based on the commercials for the movie, after reading the book, I have no real desire to see it. I am afraid I will be greatly disappointed in the movie.All-in-all, I really enjoyed the book and look forward to eventually reading Eldest: Inheritance Trilogy, Book II."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When fifteen-year-old Eragon stumbles across a dragon egg, he is thrust into the complicated world of the Dragon Riders. Eragon and his dragon take off into a fantastic journey of magic, dragons, and friendship, but not without help. An old storyteller tags along to teach Eragon his knowledge of dragons and their Riders. Later, Eragon discovers an awesome power residing in him: magic. With it, Eragon and his dragon can do almost anything. But, if the magic is used the wrong way, the cost is death. Even with magic, Eragon is captured by the evil king's accomplices. However, a mysterious figure saves them and joins the traveling trio. Eragon must evade the evil king and get an elf to the Varden. Can Eragon do it before it's too late?Eragon is full of magic, mysteries, and life's lessons. There really is no other book like Eragon. I would recommend it to anyone that likes dragons, magic, and lots of really long words that you don't know. Christopher Paolini may have been only fifteen when he wrote Eragon, but he really knew a lot about writing. Eragon is like a black hole; it sucks you in until you can't put the book down. Paolini brings you into Eragon's journey, and into the amazing world of Dragon Riders.

LOTR did come to mind quite a bit as I was reading it as did Star Wars but it was still a good read and I was impressed that a 17 year old wrote it. I've read some of the reviews on here about how he's taken things from LOTR and Star Wars and I've also read reviews that the book isn't remotely like those. Eragon is pretty much LOTR and Star Wars mixed into one with a different spin on it. Now I LOVED those books, I grew up with LOTR and the Star Wars Movies and this book isn't of the same caliber as those but it's a pretty good read.

I also felt that he didn't give a good description of how long things took. It would be a week ahead, and you might still think only two or so days had gone by.

Yes, there are certainly similarities to Lord of the Rings, but that tends to happen with most fantasy novels. People who are die hard LOTR fans (I am one of them), will always have trouble finding something as unique to read. However, that certainly does not take away from any of the wonderful fantasy novels of today. Eragon is one of them. Fantasy like everthing else these days has become post-modern, and fortunately or unfortunately all new work that comes out of this genre are constantly compared to LOTR.Back to Eragon. The relationship between Eragon's dragon Saphira and himself is very beautiful. That no one can hear the communication between the two of them other then themselves and the reader of course. This makes you feel part of a very intimate world allowing you to care as much for these two characters as if they were your own best friends. Paolini does also have some very original ideas, but also keeping with the traditional notions of the ways elves, dwarfs and dragons are thought of.

I admit there are places where the writing is less than elegant--but for all those places, there are many more where I could have said that I wish I could have written that. I noticed that the first edition paperback is selling for hundreds of dollars. Obviously, the book has sold itself well enough to penetrate the nearly impenetrable world of publishing.

The character and the plot reminded me so much of the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings! It's resemblance was too much for me to bare, I wanted to scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! (Ok that help)If it wasn't for the it being my book report for english class, I would of thrown it into a fire and sprinkle paper for fuel. Yet I must admit, my book report did get a 100% even though I was making my class crack up with my opinions and the honesty of my hate towards it. Even though all my classmates wrote a \\"I love this book so much blah blah\\" lies to sway the teacher into giving them at least a passing grade, I lashed out with my fiery of ever having such a sad book being published.For one, the character's resemblance to lord of the Rings; (excuse my spelling, I've never been good with names) Brom-Grandalf, an old wizard that is known in the town of Eragon/Frodo and tells storie, then he goes out of his way and help the little hero. The Urgals-Urikis, smelly, stupid, and far out too gross to look at. Snowfire-shadowfax, a pure white, speedy, and loyal horses to the wizard. Murtagh-Aragon (wow a double whammy) a mysterious man that shows up with rich weapons...turns out to be of noble blood. There's lots more yet I can't remember for I've lost my report somewhere in my junk mass called my \\"bedroom\\" (I've lost the bed to the room to the mass)*tear*.Now the plot, it was OLD!! Boy has somebody he loves indangered or dead and wants to advenge him/her, goes on a quest, gets some side-kicks, goes against the \\"most evil thing on earth\\" and wins, blah blah...you should now know the ending!! Yep, its all foredained!! So where does the women play a part in this? NONE...well the elf but yeah a pair of chapters to herself, YAY let's pop out the wine and ale to celebrate! What's wrong with having at least a few more women that helps out Eragon through his all so difficult quest? T_TAs you can see I'm not the old-fashion girl that likes the same old plots and stories...they bore the heck out of me for suspense and thills send me reading for more not the dull plot I got out of an exciting looking cover. Guess I've spent some dollars on a useless book when I could of brought some more Mangas...>_&lt;The suspense was ZERO for I usually get done with books in about a week at the most but this one took me the three months to finish!! I was always reluctant on picking it up to read while I could read others on my book shelf like Sunshine, Dragon Pit Trilogy, Dragonology, Demon Diary, X/1999, A deadly Game of Magic, and etc. at hand. For this author is nothing like and Amelia Atwater-Rhodes Teen Award Author, he has a good idea but his way of telling it makes me want to THROW-UP!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To borrow and alter Shakespeare a bit, \\"some [books] are born great, others achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them ...\\"Although one could argue either of the last two of those in regards to \\"Eragon,\\" there is no denying that Christopher Paolini has had his firstborn crowned with \\"greatness.\\" It is, contradicting most of the naysayers, quite an impressive debut and is worthy of attention, if not all that it has either \\"achieved\\" or has had \\"thrust\\" upon it.It was an intimidating block of a book to take on, especially for my (then) ten-year old son. In fact, at first try, reading it to him, he could not get past the first chapter. Indeed, I later recommended skipping the first chapter to friends, and/or their sons, who also found it hard to get into. I however embraced the challenge and utterly enjoyed the journey. I am happy to say that at eleven, my son also embraced it, first chapter and all, reading it together (although he often continued his reading on his own as he headed into his bed).Paolini has created a rich and varied landscape, full of his own devices (of course drawing somewhat on his own discoveries in other books), that merits a good look. Second (and third) readings have given me satisfying proof of my initial very favorable impression.Eragon is certainly a protagonist with many obstacles before him and his road is never easy. His outbursts and joys are tangible and realistic. His failings and successes are balanced and, even if one 'knows' that he will succeed in the end, his journey to the end is still full of surprises. Rather than condemn the book as derivative and a dumbing down of other, \\"greater\\" books, I am inclined to celebrate it for what it is. I think that my son will look forward to jumping into \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" _because_ of his pleasure with 'Eragon' (and now 'Eldest').There are beautifully drawn characters, each one with its own hidden sides to be guessed at. The character of Murtagh presents a terrific puzzle for the reader (as well as for Eragon!).Thoroughly recommended, even without the fanfare of the upcoming movie.As a sidenote, Christopher Paolini's newletters to his fans are a worthwhile read (available through any of the numerous websites). They appear to be written by him and are full of his wonder and honest surprises at his own journey with his creations."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For all of you who are down on this book, let's keep in mind that this is a CHILDREN'S book. Kids tend to turn off their minds and just enjoy a good story, which all of us could learn from. You don't have to compare it to the classics. Let it stand alone.

This is a great book with an intricate plot, well devoloped charecters, and a fair share of fighting with good triumphing over evil. Sure, it is modeled after Tolkein's Middle Earth quite a bit, but hey, hasn't Tolkein set the base-works for all modern fantasy?I think that part of what makes this book so attractive is the fact that it was written by an adolescent. Now, don't get the wrong impresion from that. I'm not just jumping on the bandwagon, I think this novel is appealing because, as the author is a teenager, the main charecter (Eragon, a poor tenager who discovers his hidden talents) is very easy to identify with as he learns the ropes of a difficult job at such an early age.Something that makes this novel stand out on the shelves (besides its size and bright blue color, I mean) of my ever growing fantasy and science-fiction colection is, all though there is a fair share of fighting and exitement involved, there is also much charecter devolopment, learning and everything that makes a book more than sheer violence.In short, this is a great little bundle of magic and suspense that will capture the imagination and leave you waiting for more.

At the same time, this would be an excellent introduction to the world of fantasy fiction, particularly for the younger readers. I found his literary style clean and direct, with just the right amount of descriptiveness to bring a world to life, but he betrays his young age with limited sub-plots.

Chris has written a wonderful beginning to a new series about good and evil, and one leveled at a far higher reader level than the currently popular Harry Potter series of books (so far).In these troubled times literature like yours helps people think in real terms even when reading fiction, and perhaps may ease some of our anxieties about what kind of future our world and our nation will have.

Needless to say, I was shocked at how low the quality was of the movie. The story wasn't even cohesive! There was no connection with the traditional mythical style (which I can usually find in ANY movie. There were a few character archetypes, but there was no real amount of story to hold it together).Then I picked up Eragon, the novel, in summer of 2007, with a very skeptical and critical attitude. At first I tried to make fun of some of the stuff there, saying that it's ridiculous. A boy finding a dragon egg? But really in my heart of hearts, I was liking the story. I was drawn in. The characters were very masterfully created.Little note for those of you who say that Eragon has no depth: he has just the right amount of depth. It's because a guy is writing it that the guy doesn't have a TON of depth and the girl (Arya) has very little depth. It's because we don't know a lot about girls so we don't go too deep with them, but we don't like to reveal too much about ourselves, so a lot of women think that Eragon doesn't act like a real person. He does, it's just that he acts like a guy. But I digress.His dilemma with the dragon and revealing it to the family is one I found both amusing and also tense, because that is TOTALLY how I would act in that situation. It brings quite a richness and balance to the first part of the story and leads you right where you think it will: a long, sprawling and exciting adventure.This book, if nothing else, is a ball. If you like having fun with your reading, this is the place to go. Christopher Paolini, as I can definitely tell, had a wonderful time writing this book, and I know. I had so much fun reading it that he HAD to have a lot of fun writing it. This isn't as evident in the other books, which is one downside of those, but this one is just perfect in the amound of fun and excitement. Even in the intense parts, he leads you through with a snide or sarcastic comment that'll make you laugh just the right way. I also found that since he was never planning on getting this published, or even being read, he had some of those fun George Lucas-style \\"What the heck?\\" moments. Believe it or not, ye writers, readers like to read that stuff. Not lying.Settings are described wonderfully but still briefly enough to keep the story going. Though many chapters were short and there was a brevity to the entire story (believe me, 450 pages goes a whole lot faster than you think it does), I never felt left out on where they were or what it looked like.A definite must-read. Go for it.

I admit that Paolini's writing is a bit choppy, but he was only 15 years old when he started writing Eragon, and if he keeps it up I am sure he will be a great fantasy writer that could challenge Brooks, Salvatore, Rowling, and Jordan. He's extremely young, and by the time he's 40 he'll probably be a master.When they start blabbing about how Paolini ripped off Tolkien by stealing his elves, dwarves, and, to a much lesser extent, orcs, reviewers really don't know what their talking about. In fact, they're just in trouble. If you're someone who believes what they say, you ought to continue reading this, because you should know the truth.Elves and dwarves both come from Norse/German mythology. The elves are--of course--pale, fair-haired people similar to humans who are elegant, agile creatures that live in great forests. The dwarves are those fuzzy little guys with long red beards tucked into their thick leather belts. They are master smiths and staunch warriors who live underground, and they forged a great warhammer, Mjollnir, for the god Thor. (This is probably where Salvatore got his idea of Aegis-fang.)Concerning Urgals, they are definitely \\"rip-offs\\" of orcs. Not Tolkien's ugly, bow-legged monsters that lurk in the darkness of the mountains, but the creatures of the mythologies of many ancient civilizations.1.) Orcus was one of the Roman names for the god Hades.2.) In Beowulf, the monster Grendel was an Orc-neas.3.) In English, an orc was a sea monster.4.) \\"Orco\\" means ogre in Italian.5.) \\"Orca\\" means killer whale in Italian.Orcs really aren't Tolkien's creation. Neither are elves or dwarves. And please, don't even mention dragons, because they have been around forever--literally. A simple example would be the red and white dragons that battled each other over the stronghold of Vortigern during the childhood of Merlin.As for the farmboy who saves the damsel-in-distress and goes on to save the world, there are hundreds of variations of that tale.It would seem that Paolini borrows heavily from Star Wars:Eragon/Luke live on farm; his father is unknown; his guardian(s) is killed; he seeks revenge; he saves the damsel-in-distress (Arya/Leia); he becomes a formidable warrior; he saves Alagaesia/galaxy; he revives an ancient band of heroes (Dragon Riders/Jedi).As I just mentioned, you can't borrow the \\"farmboy story.\\" Paolini used it with his character Eragon, Brooks used it with Shea Ohmsford, and Jordan used it with Rand al'Thor. Sure, you're probably thinking they are ripping-off Tolkien's Frodo, but oh, are you wrong.As for the farmboy's potent guide, Paolini's Brom matches Tolkien's Gandalf, Brooks's Allanon, Jordan's Moiraine, and even Salvatore's Zaknafein and Montolio DeBrouchee. Even the greatest fantasy writers can't do without a powerful guide. Honestly, I'm getting a little sick of that. I want to read a book where the main character has to find his way without a guide--at least for a little while.The Ra'zac may seem like Tolkien's Nazgul, but those phantoms that prowl the world for the child who is prophecized their master are just necessary to create a thrilling fantasy. There aren't many high-quality books without them. Even Jordan has them in the guise of Darkfriends and Trollocs, and Salvatore uses the reincarnation of Zaknafein for the same purpose.I am an avid writer who works with, Mr. Terry, a very smart, helpful man--no, genius--at Phillips Exeter High School, and I'm starting to take my writing seriously. I really want to get a book published, but I understand that I'm just a kid, and my writing isn't good enough to sell. For now, it's just a dream. I'm just been reading tons of fantasy and historical fiction over the past few years, and Eragon, is up there in my list of favorites. What Christopher Paolini has accomplished inspires me to keep working.So just relax, and just enjoy an exciting book without having to flip out whenever there's a grammatical mistake or \\"cliche.\\" Eragon is a spectacular piece of writing created by a very, very talented young author. I'm looking forward to reading Eldest, which comes out in . . . 6 days!And remember that Tolkien did not invent elves, dwarves, orcs, and dragons. If you're going to criticize Paolini for borrowing, then at least criticize him for borrowing from the Norse, not Tolkien and other fantasy writers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book has no originality.

It is imaginative and original, even if a few of the ideas and names are borrowed from something else. I don't see their books on the bestseller list!This book, I would also like to mention, is considered to be a young adult level book, so if you are an adult and believe that the ideas are childish, understand that it wasn't made for your reading level anyway. So don't blame the author. It's kind of like a thirteen year old reading the Berstein Bears. It doesn't make much sense.It is a good book that deserves much praise, no matter how old the author is.

Learning to use a sword in 3 days? How bout a new language! No problem. Important things that should take weeks and months are explained in one sentence, while breaking a limb in a stupid moment takes 3 pages.All of the cliches are here.

Eventually it hatches, and Eragon, the dragon, and the village storyteller have to head out on a mighty quest to find the people that murdered Eragon's uncle, along the way discovering things about the dragon riders.I thought Eragon was a highly absorbing read, although the actual ideas in the book were not anything new. I admit that it did not have any particular new twist, but it did have some new details added in that I'd never seen before. This book has been continually compared to The Lord of the Rings, but I've actually never read that series. I tried, and I disliked the way they were written.

That's fanfiction.Sure, the kid is only 17 years old, but that's no excuse for not having an original idea. Has anyone ever read the Outsiders? That was written by an 18 or 19 year old girl and had FAR more character development and more overall FEELING to the book than this did. Age is no excuse, I'm sorry.No offense intended, but the kid needs to wean himself off the fanboi-hood of his favorite sci-fi and fantasy, sit down and think about his own ideas, take a few writing classes or practice, and then try again."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am going to attempt to present my viewpoint on this book without flaming. Forgive if I fail. These are just a few of my observations.1.) The characters are somewhat shallow, with names eerily similar to those of other famous fantasy characters. However, due to the fact of Paolini's age when the book was written, I can allow that to pass as a show of \\"fanboy\\" attitudes and lack of originality.2.) The names of the places in the book are reasonably easy to pronounce and remember, a fact which earns Paolini high marks in my estimation. A few names, such as Du Weldenvarden, seem overly complicated in an effort to make them sound more \\"fantastical\\". However, overall, very well done.3.) The dialogue, at times, was passable, but mostly was stiff and somewhat unbelievable. In \\"Eldest\\", Paolini improved mildly, and I look forward to seeing further improvements.4.) The plot is cliched to the point of pain. Need I say more?According to Paolini's website, he originally did not intend for the book to be published. It should have remained so until he had mastered several key things: plot, dialogue, and character development. If he had waited, rewritten, revised, and thought things out more carefully, the book would've been much better. But, for now, I give him credit for a book half-done, though mildly entertaining."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Every fantasy has its similarities to and is inspired one way or another by other fantasies. I have never held this fact against against them. That is, until I read Eragon. It wasn't that he borrowed elements from nearly every fantasy ever made. It was simply that he added nothing of his own.No matter how much other fantasies may borrow, take and copy, there is almost always that mark of originality that makes the book their own. In The Wheel of Time, Jordon may have been inspired by Tolkien is many ways, but you don't notice the similarities unless you're looking for it. Also, the original system of magic, the lack of elves and dwarves for a change and the introduction of Ogiers is quite original. Anne McCaffery, RR Martin, JK Rowling, all have similar elements and were all inspired by one thing or the other, but they were INSPIRED. They didn't just take a lot of things other people wrote and put it together.Eragon is about yet another boy who lives in a little village in the middle of nowhere and has no idea he will become a hero who will save the world one day. He finds a dragon egg and not much later has to leave his idyllic country life with yet another wise old magician guy and set off towards world salvation.One of the few interesting things about the book is that the badguy is actually insane, not evil and he befriends the son of a badguy. Personally, that one should have been the hero; it would have been quite original and his character is much more interesting than Eragon's.The writing is pretty, certainly, but the content is hardly satisfying. For a newcomer to the fantasy genre, Eragon is certainly appealing. Its also great place for young teens to start off. However, if you're hoping its in the league of Harry Potter, with little kids having online arguments and websites dedicated to theories and discussions, forget it. There's really nothing in it to discuss. The prophecy gives away the entire plot and I already know who the love interest is. The elves and dwarves were sterotypical and bland. This is a teen book, written by teens for teens, preferably young ones.On a personal note, I really dislike the ending. Eragon is scarred by a sword on his back. Even though he can still walk and fight and is really not disfigured in any way, suddenly he see himself as a cripple. That disappointed me to no end in his character. I prefer the the philosophy, 'he who limps is still walking', so a kid who freaks out over a mark on his back holds little appeal for me.Its contrived, copied and overall nothing special. But it certainly is not bad. For a black and white world and nothing thought-provoking, its a decent escape."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was so boring that I couldn't even get past the third chapter. Like many people before me, I was drawn in by the cover art, but the book itself isn't worth reading. I couldn't connect with the hero of the story at all, and...well, I couldn't really connect with any of the characters. I don't want to sound rude, but the author himself seems a bit egocentric....If he wants to create the next 'big' fantasy series, then he could at least come up with some original ideas. A story's charm lies in its content, not in however old the author was when he wrote the thing. Paolini may use his age as a selling tool, but I know of 13-year-old authors who have written better books than this."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is your average fantasy book written by a talented teenager. I loved the story but there were many flaws in how it was written. Through the first half of the book, Paolini's dialogue writing was terrible. The conversations lack substance and style. However, you can see Paolini improve over the rest of the book to where it is hardly noticeable.Now, Paolinis development of the character Eragon is somewhat on the level of your high school freshman. We meet a teenager who is hunting in a dangerous mountain range that many people avoid. He takes care of himself pretty easily and his observations are sharp and perfect. Then when we see him reach his home town, he acts so immature that it is ridiculous. After the events that take place in his home town, he takes on the companion Brom. Within six months, Eragon becomes one of the best sword-fighters and most talented magician in the Empire. His conversations still border on the lunacy of naivete despite his great skill with everything else. Also, in random areas, Eragon goes from a total goof into making complex plans and observations. This inconsistency from the author should have been caught by the editor.Now, the actual story. This is what keeps Eragon worth reading. Being 18, I have read the Jordan, Tolkien, Goodkind Harry Potter, George RR Martin series. Yes its true that you can see major similarities to some of these works. However, this story struck me more on the side of Star Wars. Lets pretend Eragon is Annikan. Annikan, who has never had any training, proves to be skilled at everything. Then he comes into his power and people worship him just because he has a rare gift. He then destroys the droid mothership and saves the day. Eragon becomes skilled so fast that it borders on hilarious. People worship him because he has a dragon. Low and behold, he saves the day at the end of the book accomplishing an improbably feat. Now from the way Ive told of the writer's mistakes youll wonder why I gave it three stars. First of all, He finished writing it at the age of 17, which is a stunning feat in and of itself. Second, his environmental descriptions keep up with any other fantasy writer without going overbored on frivolous items like the writers goodkind and jordan have done. Third, the actual idea of the story is cool. Three points= three stars. Through the last two hundred pages I didnt feel like putting it down despite the lack of sleep and the crude use of language. I look forward to picking up the next book when it comes out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini was fifteen years old when he began writing this book. This shows. The writing style is immature, and the tone is inconsistant. At one point, he will speak in almost medieval syntax, in the tone of a story of knights and dragons, and in the next, in the tone of a fifteen year old boy speaking with his friends. In addition, the main character bears a remarkable to the author, and the novel frequently refers to how close he is to 'manhood'. His references to women are frequently demeaning. This is a teenage boy's published daydreams of heroism and beautiful women indebted to him, because he will never achieve what he writes. It is not epic or grand or even uniqe. This novel would be a waste of your earnings."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really can't say much that others have not already covered completely already.I can see why people want to give all these 5 star reviews. They really have run across what could be a good story. Any avid fantasy reader can definitely see what authors \\"influenced\\" this one. The problem is, this author has basically pick-pocketed this good story from other's ideas, names and even plots. Then mix them up, rename(barely), piece them all back together and actually sell them here as an \\"original\\" work. Sorry but this just doesn't cut it for me.Sure, I imagine at such a young age it probably is harder to come up with fresh ideas based on your life experiences. If he did that he would deserve all this 5 stars and praise. I think we have all heard the saying \\"IMITATION is a form of flattery\\" but I don't think this is what they meant.I guess the idea was the target audience of this book most likely have not read a lot of the victim's works yet so it is easy to hide from them. I think I would have tried a little bit harder though. Just reading this book makes me feel dirty. I have this desire to keep checking the cover to see if it will peel back and reveal what certainly seems to be a really bad \\"tribute\\" to the other author's stories, without giving the credit.Like many others I suggest reading the original works (Tolkien, McCaffrey, etc) instead of buying and supporting this type of publication."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first heard of the book Eragon, it seemed full of promise. A fantasy book involving dragons, elves, dwarves, and magic? And what's more, it's been written by a child prodigy? Sign me up!Upon getting a copy of the book and opening it up, the first thing which struck me was the writing style. Normally, I have no problem getting into a book, but Eragon felt choppy to me. The writing didn't seem to flow very well, and made the book difficult to read.\\"Well, he was only 15 when he began writing it,\\" I thought. \\"Surely the writing style will get better as the story goes on!\\" True enough, it did get better, but not much.The second thing which struck me was a sense of \\"Haven't I seen this before?\\" Whenever he introduced something, I got a feeling that I had seen it somewhere before. When he introduced the telepathic dragon Saphira, all I could think of was \\"When are they going to begin fighting Thread like the rest of the Dragonriders of Pern?\\" When the magic was introduced, I began looking for a character called Sparrowhawk. The elves and dwarves seemed to me as though they had been lifted straight from Middle-Earth, as did many of the names. When the Ra'zac appeared, I stifled a yawn and considered them a simple variation on the Nazgul, just as the urgals were orcs with horns. Durza the shade? Particularly during the final battle, I was reminded strongly of the shades from the Wheel of Time series.\\"Well,\\" I thought, \\"Perhaps this book is more 'derivative' than is proper. It still might not be too bad. What of the plot itself? What of the characters?\\"At best, the plot was 'traditional,' as far as fantasy books go. At worst, it was cliched, overused, dull, and predictable. There were no really surprising plot twists, and nothing really seemed to be new and exciting. The characters were little better, each taking their expected role and never deviating from it, or showing much of a personality. Murtagh was an exception, as he actually did have a personality, and I could get something of an idea of what made him tick. Brom was almost an exception, although that has less to do with personality and more to do with the fact that, as a general rule, old mentors are almost always enjoyable to read about.To sum up, I could have forgiven Paolini and almost enjoyed Eragon if either the prose had flowed in an enjoyable fashion, or if the characters, setting, and plot were original. As neither ended up being true, Eragon became a chore to read, made all the more disappointing by all the hype which proclaimed it a masterpiece. I have trouble considering it to be a good book. What matters is not how good this book is compared to those written by 17-year olds, what matters is how good this book is period. A worthy first try, perhaps, but not something which belongs in print, not something which belongs on the best-seller's list, and certainly not something which is \\"a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf,\\" as Paolini claimed to have striven for."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As I dragged myself through this book, it became VERY obvious that the auther was young and an inexperinced fantasy writer. This book lacks the depth of character seen in many other best selling fantasy novels/series. The author just did not write characters that I cared about, other than Saphira. If you don't care about the charaters, why bother reading the book? I love the idea of the story, just not that way that Christopher Paolini has written it. Maybe he needed a better editor, I don't know. He shows great promise, perhaps he'll publish something worthy of reading by the time he's 30."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't doubt that there are readers out there who like this book. But let's be real: this book gets no pub or positive reviews if the author is not 17.I appreciate the fact that Paolini seized his dream and wrote the book and I have no doubt that a lot of love and care went into it's writing. However the author's age comes through in many ways both glaring and subtle. When Tolkien wrote about beer and pipes in his fantasy you just knew that this was a guy who loved both. And when you read biographies about him or the Inklings (the group of peers he hung out with) it's confirmed: he loved nothing more than to gather with good friends, drink a pint, smoke his pipe and talk. When Paolini writes about pipes and beer (especially in regards to his Gandalf knock off) it reads exactly as if it was written by someone who had no real experience with either but felt he had to include them so that his work could be more legitimate. It feels contrived rather than authentic and that's ultimately what separates great fiction from bad. Tolkien's imagination teamed with the mythologies of ancient peoples; he grounded himself in those peoples' languages even while inventing his own. That depth and experience shines through the pages of his work. Paolini's work at this point feels by the numbers, as if he studied the forumlas of Tolkien and other great writers and then tried to overlay them onto his own work.Make no mistake: Paolini is a talented writer. My hope is that all the adulation does not prevent him from developing his own set of experiences from which to draw on as he finds his voice."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ya I wanted to tell everyone that this is a GREAT book, for ALL ages, Now I have read this book and wanted to do nothing more than read more.

I hope there's more books like this. I am also reading Inkheart. I hope it's good like Eragon. And I hope you like Eragon too.

While there are some similarities there are more than enough differences to call this an original work. I found this book very entertaining not only for young adults but for adults as well (I'm thirty-four). This is a well paced thought out book with interesting characters and enough plot development and action to keep you interested. I can't believe the author was only fifteen or so when he wrote it. Amazing. I also liked how the book was very clean language wise and the action and war scened were told in a way where it wasn't over the top gorry. Those of you who like action/fantasy books with a great plot, great action with a coming of age type story will love this book. I am looking forward to the next book Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I started to read the book my imagination just poped open like when you open a book.

The book was awesome!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First of all I'd like to congratulate Mr. Paolini on publishing a book at the age of 19. That is an incredible feat, which would be more remarkable if the ideas portrayed in the story hadn't already been used. Sure the captivating story of a young boy who is lost in the world and is just trying to figure out his place is interesting, but the interest tends to fade about the one-thousandth time you read it. The other flaw that I found in the book was the familiar characters from J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings Trilogy-The elf with mysterious powers-the dwarves that tunnel underground-The monstrous creation of a seemingly unbeatable army and the familiarity of names such as, Arya and Arwen, Eragon and Aragorn, Urgals and Orcs. I also observed a dash of Harry Potter magic between the pages. I hold a love for Fantasy novels, but just because it is catagorized as a fantasy doesn't mean it has to include elves dwarves, magic, and dragons- I think the tires on that wagon are running thin (the extreme length of the story didn't help either). I look for a fantasy novel that invents new ideas and new creatures for the mind to explore, that it why I rated this book as a TWO. I also like a novel that can keep my attention for the entirety which Eragon also lacked to do. So I would only reccomend this book to someone who really enjoys the same old thing, all you other adventurers look for your entertainment elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read Eragon after reading The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books by Robert Stanek so it was quite a change from an epic storyline with lots of subtext to the simpler story line of Eragon. While everyone is talking about The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books, Eragon is the better story and let me tell you why. Eragon is a simple story of a boy versus the world. He starts out a simple farm boy and is soon a hero of the land. Eragon is written by 15-year-old wunderkid Christopher Paolini. It is his first book and the story will only get better as it goes on. This makes book 1 in the inheritance a stunning success."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I absolutly loved this book.even if you already read it buy it!!!everyone says it's exactly like lord of the rings but it's not!its an amazing book!!!!!buy it.and to all you haters: shut up because this book may have been \\"copying\\" lord of the rings but so what??? its a good book any ways.and shut up about it because just cause u didn't like it doesn't mean u have to ruin it for other people who haven't read it.ok i'll stop rambling now."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've been reading for most of my fifteen years, fantasy and science fiction being my favorites, and pretty much all I could say after I first read this was &quot;WOW!&quot; I haven't had a clear favorite book for at least 5 years, but now I'm happy to say I do. The way this guy writes, it's just awesome. It's fantasy his way, his world, his rules. No backing off on new ideas, and portraying everything just beautifully! I absolutely could not put this book down, first or second time I read it. The only person who can compare with this is Tolkien, and even he's given a run for his money here.

But if we provide well thought out criticism, the Eragon fanatics call us arrogant elitists (yes, I'm looking at you Johnathan D Ruark).

The other reviewer's sum it up nicely."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ok. I will start by saying the obvious. He wrote this first part of the \\"Inheritance\\" trilogy when he was seventeen. Not bad, for a first time published author, but it had no right to be published. Many unknown authors are much better than this one.Ok, the story is basically this: Eragon (main character) gets his family, besides his brother, killed after finding an odd stone, which is really a dragon egg that hatches about ten pages after he finds it, in this supposedly \\"haunted\\" mountain range called the Spine. Eragon runs away with a very odd storyteller (Brom) who just-so-happens to be one of the magical \\"Riders\\" of ye olden times. Brom gets boy into a bunch of trouble, and gets himself killed. Eragon meets a man along the road named Murtagh and befriends him and sets out to the Varden (\\"Rebel Alliance\\" against the \\"Empire\\"). A large war happens that takes about ten pages in length happens which is actually supposed to be of some importance and ta da. The End.I will start out on the positive elements of the book. It is very long and had these beautiful, intricate, descriptive passages all throughout his book. And... That's about it for the positive stuff.Now for the negative. The beautiful palaces of marble that he made with the dialogue had to be disturbed by the extremely wooden dialogue. Now add that with the fact that the main character is a fifteen year old boy who sounds like a seventy-year old, and this makes a very bad story. The characters have almost no realism and the only character who acts at all like a real person is this sad excuse for a witch named Angela. She is the only one in the entire book who actually has something that every character in every book needs: personality. You can picture this: This story is basically a giagantic marble palace with entirely wooden floors and Ben Stein as every one of the characters except Angela.The absolute worst thing though is that you can see copies of things from other authors, especially Tolkien.Besides everything above, Christopher Paolini is still a well-established author now, thanks to his parents publishing his book at the beginning.

This provokes a sense of mystery in me. As I read the entire series, sure, I saw how these great creators had \\"influenced\\" Paolini, but I never saw evedence of plagiarism. My point being...don't let the haters spoil your experience with this series.On to the book. I loved the character development, plot, and the non story book endings. Once I started Eragon I literally could not put the books down. Paolini set the hook, reeled me in, netted me, and took me to the taxidermist! I was effectivly a trophy that reminds him of another satisfied reader.I highly suggest this series to anyone and everyone!To Christopher Paolini, I hope that you continue to write incredible storys that we as readers can't put down!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I would give this book zero stars if possible. But, as I can only give it one, I guess I'll tell you why.First off, the plot line is ripped out from a number of books, with similarities to Dragon Riders of Pern, Lord of the Rings, and a number more.Second, his discribing skills are... Lacking. All of his chapters (Except for the first three, he redid those ones) had set ups similar to this: Setting discription, action in setting, put characters into the setting then to add in more action.Third, the urgals, are amazing like J. R. Tolkien's little demon things. You see, the reason why he tacked on horns and a few other things was to evade the fact that he would be sued if he didn't.Forth, the Elves languages are nearly exactly the same to the Lord of the Rings once again, while where the elfs came from is exactly the same (they came on silver ships from the east.), and then the same with the dwarfs.Fifth, the book's discription is terrible. There was something in there that was pretty much like this: The urgal ran towards Eragon, then froze in time so the author could explain how it looked. (Note, the last part was in the book, but it's how the urgal acted pretty much.)Sixth, the plot is predictable. Every 'twist' there is not a surprise, but another dismal fact that it's so much like other books that if you didn't read this book, you'ld still knew what was going on.Seventh, he literally stripped some names from Lord of the Rings and altered them slightly and/or he added these: ' and kept all the lettering order in the same order.Other reasons, (Spoiler alert.) my sister and I were reading the books for this triligy, and I told my sister that Eragon had a brother. Instantly, my sister knew who it was and then cursed that the author, and I have a feeling that the ending will be like this: ZOMG! Eragon won! *gasp* It was so hard! But everyone knew he could! Ta-da! He didn't have to kill his brother! He still has a crush on a princess elf! But she won't love him back! ZOMG!I think that this book go waaaay to much credit for being 'original' or 'creative'. To say it bluntly, it's not. It's pathetic and sad.-De.PS: Doesn't matter how big the book is, it depends on how well written and orignal it is."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"...Because Eragon is bad enough when you judge it alone.Eragon is your basic fantasy story, the archtypical hero tale that Paolini says on his website that he set out to write. It's a pure, dyed-in-the-wool hero tale, so Paolini gets a point.But that's all he gets.So, Eragon is about a poor boy with foggy origins who finds a magical thing and who is forced to flee when agents of the dark ruler of the land kill his family. He goes off with a mysterious old man who knows far more than he tells, and the boy learns that he is the last of a now-gone group of great warriors who once protected the land from evil. The old man trains him in the ways of that group as they journey through the land, encountering enemies, rescuing a damsel, and joining up with rebels who oppose the evil king. Along the way, the old man dies. There is, of course, a big battle, and a great enemy is defeated.I'll admit, I like these stories. But I like these stories to have something extra, something to make them interesting and original. With Eragon, it was just the story, and plotted so tightly that everything happened exactly when and how it was supposed to happen, so any surprise or interest vanished. The Ra'zac appeared precisely on time. Eragon escaped at the right moment. Brom showed up at the right time because Eragon asked the right questions and made the right mistakes. They went to all the right places, met all the right people, learned all the right things. Brom died and the precise moment, perfect timing, and Murtagh appeared right on schedule, and they were lucky enough to save the damsel in the nick of time, and they had the perfect race against time to the Varden with the right people chasing them, and they made it to the Varden on time, and the final battle was just on time. And throughout the story, Eragon falls unconscious or gets trapped at the most convenient moments so other people may save the day and solve his problems. The End.Perfect. That's it. It's all wonderful timing, and there is no surprise, no wonder, nothing wrong. It's all too perfect. And because of all that, it's boring.As for the characters, they all fit so nicely into their own roles that there's no room to make them interesting. Eragon is good and noble and heroic. Brom is old and experienced and tough for an old man. Saphira is wise, so wise one wonders why dragons even need riders. You have a tough rogue, a lovely heroine, a witch and her mysterious familiar. A mad, evil warlord with Darth Vader syndrome when backstory is concerned. Et cetera.I haven't even started on Paolini's vocabulary, which gets worse in Eldest. I have a fair vocabulary too, but I also understand that sometimes, most times, simple vocabulary is far more affective. Paolini should read the few pages Stephen King devoted to vocabulary in his book \\"On Writing.\\" In it, King tells us that \\"Bob stopped long enough to take a [crap]\\", though vulgar and crude, is much better than \\"Bon stopped long enough to perform an act of excretion.\\"Unfortunately, I suspect that Paolini would use the latter example in his writing, and he does so, multiple times, throughout both books.I could go on, and on, and on, but I feel I've wasted enough time. Those who hated the book will agree, those who loved the book will send flames my way, and Christopher Paolini will still write poorly-written novels."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Spoilers ahead.Along with the general immaturity in treatment of a wonderful genre of fantasy, that of ye olde boy bonds with amazing creature, and the rather uninspiring choice of the formulaic \\"Lose family, find amazing mentor who dies, become uber-\\"1337\\" (the main character simply has TOO much wonderful power to be fair), ride around killing people, find evil relatives in places of power, kill said evil relatives\\" plot, this book shows us what fantasy lovers have said is true: too many people are put off by the sheer inexhaustible imitation in the genre.\\"Immature artists imitate, mature artists steal.\\" -Lionel Trilling.Good writing steals the good parts of others writings and personalizes it to the author's taste without plagerizing (of course). Bad writing is cheap imitation. Think fine French goat milk cheese versus Kraft American Processed Pasteurized Cheese Food Product with it's two amazing flavors: white and yellow.That being said, this book is worth a read because you can learn as much as or more from bad writing than good writing (Stephen King goes on at length about this in his book On Writing, which is highly recommended). Eragon exemplifies a success story, yes, but the kind of success story that all aspiring writers should avoid. In that way, it is the perfect embodiment of How Not To Write."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think the author should have invested more time in creative writing and life experience before writing this book (jacket indicates he was 15 when he started the novel). For me, it came down to this, there was no passion, no emotion, no complexity and character development. It read like a \\"What I did on my summer vacation\\" essay. I read it for book club, and only finished it for the ammunition to debate with the other members. Pass on this for more celebrated novels."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Having just finished reading Eragon I thought I needed to write a more objective review than the, I'm sure, glowing reports, already on Amazon. Only to find, Lo! The previous review says exactly what I wanted to say. Had this been written by anyone but a 17 year old, it would not receive the volumes of praise being heaped upon it. As a 20 year veteran of the high school English classroom, this is exactly the sort of over-the-top, rehash-every-trope-I've-ever read sort of fiction I'd expect my creative writing students to turn out. As Paolin matures and develops the confidence to travel into less well-known, more imaginative, territory, I'm sure he'll turn out some interesting fantasy. As it is, anyone who has read the fantasy canon will experience deja vu repeatedly as they make their way through this novel. One can argue that most fantasy is derivative--Tolkien borrowed from the various world mythologies, for example--but the very best fantasy carries a depth of tone and meaning simply missing here. Paolin has taken all the fantasy motifs and plot elements (the quest, the sword, the wise elder with a secret past, the dragon/rider bond (stolen from McCaffrey in such a blatant way I'm surprised she can't sue!), etc and simply strung them together with no consideration for the more archetypal meaning. And the writing style is that of the above-mentioned precocious teenager, with its purple prose and loaded adjectives: \\"He found a sympathetic Rider, and there his insidious words took root. By persistent reasoning and the use of dark secrets, he inflamed the Rider against their elders. Together they treacherously lured and killed and elder. When the foul deed was done, Galbatorix turned on his enemy and slaughtered him without warning.\\" I was laughing so hard at this point, my fiancee asked me what I was reading. Suffice it to say that, when Galbatorix wins his showdown with the good dragon rider by kicking him in the groin (excuse me, \\"the fork of his legs\\") this becomes not epic fantasy, but farce.Having said all that, if it gets kids to read, more power to it. And maybe they'll then move on to the really great fantasy: Tolkien and LeGuin and McKillip, and Kay, among others. Paolin is trying to fill big shoes; given time, I hope he can. Good fantasy is hard to find."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is just not very original. In fact, after reading it, I got so hungry for the dragons of Pern that I am rereading that whole series (and all the offshoots). Don't bother with Eragon. Read Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern series and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings instead; both of these series are far, far more intriguing and imaginative."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Now I, like everyone else who has read this book has heard about the age factor,(only fifteen when he started), and I have also heard the \\"Tolkien-who.\\" That is simply ridiculous. I have read numerous fantasy novels but this one just seems like a genaric version of the same old thing. The most distracting part of this story is the fact that he stole a lot of Tolkien's work which really does borderline plagerism.The storyline is solid but at the same time it is simply to safe. All the great authors expand on great ideas and build new worlds, but Paolini simply sticks to the severely beaten fantasy path. A boy who starts off poor, travels with a mysterious mentor, frees a beautiful woman, and then follows his destiny. How many times must I see this!Another thing is the character development. This is by far some of the worst character development I have ever seen. He starts off as a snobby sarcastic boy and he ends a sarcastic and snobby boy. Saphira who is supposed to be this awe inspiring dragon is nothing but an oversized Eragon. I do realize she has spent her whole life with only humans, but nonetheless there seems to very little of her own species within her. Brom, (whos mysterious past is about as mysterious as a toaster), basically seems like Gandalf's long lost step-brother, who wasn't loved as a boy while Gandalf got all the attention.The creatures are all generic. The Dwarves are exactly as you would expect and the elves are the same way. The whole world seems like a rip-off of Middle Earth. You don't need to be Galadriel to see what was going to happen throughout the book. While reading it you can almost sense what the next line is going to be.On a better note, despite not meeting my expectations at all, it still is a great start for a young author like Christopher Paolini. I hope Eragon was a learning experience and I expect Eldest to be much better. I wish I could give this book a good review but in good conscience I can't.

There is nothing original, nothing singular to be derived from this text - only the tired repetition of the heroic quest, the plodding advancement of a well-tread plotline old as the concept of the cliche. Tolkienic influence is in abundance, most profoundly in the description of the various races. You have your elves, your dwarves, your humans. And oh, did I mention that the elves are a slender, graceful people in possession of extensive lifespans? Oh, and that the dwarves are a gruff assemblage of bearded miners with axe fixations? Ug.Why is this book receiving such a slew of unjust accolades? I can only assume that the author's relative youth has piqued the interest of a fantasy-starved public.

He probably gets knocked out when he goes to the doctors office and he hits him in the knee with that reflex thing. Also, whenever he is wounded, he heals quicker than he would have if he had been on the medicine of today. He breaks his ribs, and within the period of a month, a month of TRAVELING at that, he's perfectly healed. This is beyond fantasy.Case 2: Saphira the dragon.

If all you see is evil in magic and miss the whole point of the book then you are saddly missing a great adventure. For crying out loud the greatest Christian philosopher and theologist of our time was CS Lewis. Did he use magic in his stories? hm?also, to the person who complained about the structure of Eragon being an editors nightmare. Have you read LOTR?

With the counsel of a village elder, Brom, Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, embark on a long, dangerous trek of revenge, betrayal, awakening, and destiny. Although this is the first book of the Inheritance trilogy, the story comes to a good conclusion and can stand on its own.

It's your typical fantasy book except it is so detailed and magical that you can't stop reading from the first chapter to the last. If you have read a Harry Potter book or Tolkien book then I would recommend this book in a heart beat. This book not only has amazing characters and an amazing plot, but it puts you in a world that is a perfect setting for a fantasy book. This book takes Tolkiens Detail of they environment and combines it with the magic in the Harry Potter series and combines those with the authors own writing style. People will argue that's what makes the book bad because its not original when actually its probably the most original book out there. That's why before the book was even published Fox wanted to make a movie of the book. Which is supposed to come to theaters this year. The books most appealing thing of all is even though it's supposed to be for young readers its actually for everyone. It has its softer parts in the book but its also has its big battles. To sum this hole review up is don't listen to me or anyone else, just go out and read this book for your self and you will love it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is the best fantasy book I've ever read.

He decides to ride his dragon to have his revenge on the king."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon was extremely good for a fifteen year old, but, that aside, the language was bombastic and arrogant, the pacing was shaky, and cause and effect was a little off. In short, the editor needed to commit far more adverbicide. I couldn't get into the plot, because I was scratching my head over the trippy language. I can't wait to see what this author turns out in 20 years, though."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Let's just say that I felt better knowing that this book was written by a 19 year old. Actually, finding out that fact resolved many questions for me.It's not a horrific book. It's interesting and can be entertaining. However, it's no Lord of the Rings and the worst thing about it is the fact that it seems to BE like Lord of the Rings.I am OK with books with similar plots and characters, as long as the book is well written and with an interesting plot. Unfortunately, the book was not well written. The descriptions of the \\"exciting\\" parts were confusing and I had to reread certain sentences twice to figure out what the heck was going on. That really took away the excitement \\"feel\\" from those passages.Also, the book is so anti-climatic! I know that there are the second and third book, but after reading so many pages to pretty much find out that nothing really developed, I definitely am not going to finish this series.Maybe if you are a lover of fantasy fiction, I would say go for it. Otherwise, despite the hype about the series, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is very well written, and very interesting, until you discover one thing: it's exactly the same as Star Wars.

If you want to read good writing rather than a gimmick, try another book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon(Whistles) Hmm...what is this Eragon; or who, or where? Well, the answer to what Eragon was an endeavor by fairly new fantasy writer, Christopher Poalini; which can be explained even more than that. Where can you find it? Well, either here, at Amazon, or probably at your local library. Who?Eragon is a human youth that is proceeding into manhood, who lives outside a village called Carvahall, (which is in the close-to-utmost limits of the empire of the evil emperor, Galbatorix) with his farmer uncle, Garrow, and his cousin, Roran. Life as a farm boy is fairly harsh, and to buy meat from the village butcher, Sloan, would not only be expensive, but also unpleasant, since, for some reason, the butcher has had a disliking for Garrow and his family; so Eragon is hunting the meat for his family before the winter season fully sets in. Trekking and tracking for two days along an area called the Spine, he comes upon his query, a deer with a limp, among a bundle of its sleeping fellows in a slightly cleared pine grove. He relaxes for a moment and prepares his arrow for its destination. An explosion happens near by. The deer are startled awake, and the abrupt sound amplifies with jolts of heated air and appearance of fire. The deer quickly came to their feet and scattered, with the fire quickly spreading around them. Eragon, coming out of a surprise dazed moment quickly tries to fix his eyes on the partially maimed deer among all the chaos. He spots it, rapidly brings his bow to bear, and fired as the animal quickly sprinted away. The arrow wised past the target by a hair's breath, and the deer were gone. Eragon was infuriated with himself (and punched himself...just kidding) and thought about returning home with nothing to present, and the cold winter ahead for his family. Around him, the surrounding area smoldered and the air reeked with the smoke of the late fall grass and the pine needles of the trees. He wondered to himself what made this event come to pass. Could it be magic? The thought pervaded in his mind. Could it be? This area on the map was deemed a magical place by the villagers, where as he had traveled it several times, always trying to be alert as he walked, and came back in one piece. The sun retired to sunset and soon the night spread its darkness around him.He walked a short distance from the area, only to come upon a slight pit in the ground with an orb in the middle of its impounded walls. He looked upon it in wonder and apprehension. It looked beautiful, seeming a bluish color, and glared like glass in the moonlight. He stretched an arrow hesitantly toward it, touched it, and quickly drew it back. Nothing happened. Curiosity flooded him and he put his hand forward and picked it up. It was slightly heavy, so he held it in both of his hands as he examined it. It looked to be a stone, but was indeed beautiful to behold! Had this been the thing that caused this to happen, and where did it come from? He thought. Was it magic...?Was it magic? Hmm...well, I'll let the reader search that out, but allow me to unfold a few of my opinions on this book.Let's see, how did I come to read this literature? Oh, yes! My sister, who had taken it out of the library, let me read it ahead of her, kind of to test the waters, you might say.Upon reading it, I will tell you that the beginning is very good. It has a nice pace, and an intriguing atmosphere about it that helps the story come alive. Though, I will warn you, toward the middle and end, it does begin to lose its intrigue and starts to feel more like filler than concrete story. Added to that, you might notice that the story, or at least the characters, bears quite a shadow of classics such as Lord of the Rings, among others (or at least that is the only one I can think of at this moment). That being said, I think it was awesome that he (along with everyone that helped him in various ways) undertook such a behemoth of a book at the age of sixteen; I'm personally glad for him.The characters in the story range from fairly well developed to not so well; as you read it you'll probably feel that there should have been more to them. Quite a few areas in the book were illustrated with wording very well, to create a picture in your mind, whether it is landscape, cityscape, and the view age of mountains with the stories that are attached to them; it can make for a slightly indulging experience. And then, of course, there are parts that are not so well rounded out. Eragon, himself, as a character, might come across a bit like Anakin in the Star Wars series, in that, he is kind of looked upon as the \`chosen one'; the one who so many characters in the story pin their hopes on, and upon the success or failure of his endeavor, their fates will be decided. Now, while that might seem alright in some ways, it kind of seems to put all the eggs in one basket, making the story a bit weak.And there probably plenty of other critiques that could be pointed out, but ultimately you make the decision on the successfulness of this book, as well as the series.If you have any comments on this review, please use the comment box.-Jake Smithers"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is just amazing.

Eragon proves that children can write amazing books, too, and that people can achieve greatness no matter what. From the very beginning, Eragon hs people gripped.

There are three main characters in this story and the three names are Eragon, Brom, and Saphira. Eragon is a poor hunter who lives with his brother and uncle. He was hunting in a place known for bad luck, called the Spine. That is where he finds the magical egg of Saphira the dragon. Saphira only hatches when she finds the perfect person fit enough to be her Rider. She hatched for him and they became the best of friends and a great team. As Eragon and his Uncle go to the market to sell and trade items, Eragon runs into a magical storyteller named Brom, who is the third main character in the story. Together Eragon, Saphira, and Brom set out on a remarkable adventure to get revenge on the horrible creatures that killed Eragon's only uncle. The whole setting is the forest.

I'd recommend ages 13+, not because of content (though there is some violence), but because younger kids might not be able to understand some vocabulary.

There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it, and other times that he writes far beyond what you would expect from someone his age. Excellent read that I would recommend to any fan of this genre."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Pro: It gets steadily better and more exciting towards the end. For a teenager, this is amazing, but there is another book I read by a teenager which is better, except I've forgotten the name.Con:The writing is sometimes clunky, dragons are too perfect-not in personality, but the author keeps on saying that dragons are mysterious and stuff so that when they do totally amazing things like create diamonds out of nowhere he can just use that as an excuse, Eragon has too many powers-a lot of the time the authors states something along the lines of 'wow, what you did in X days normally takes a person X months/years', the characters are unlikeable, and most importantly, it's excruciatingly unorginal.Now, I'm not a big fan of Lord Of The Rings, so I've only read the books once. But even I can tell that several things are stolen from LoTR, Ursula K. Leguin, and fantasy in general. The twists aren't surprising at all for someone who reads enough books-not just fantasy-to know all of the cliches. And it irks me that they don't even bother to make Eragon just born powerful, he's special because he is named after this really powerful guy (obvious, much?) and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a prophecy about his birth too. -.-Still, for a teenager it's good and toward the end it's exciting enough for me to want to read the next book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is one of the finest fantasy works I have read. It takes the reader on a wonderful adventure, involving them in the mystical relationship of a boy, his dragon and his mentor. The story flows naturally and easily as you are taken along with the characters on their journey to right their world. You cannot help but cheer for them. I cannot wait for the young Mr. Paolini's sequel novel. For now I have slipped Eragon into my collection, next to Tolkein."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is, somewhat, a novel that secretly combines a lot of different authors' work. For example: Paolini used elves, dwarves and dragons from J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of The Rings.\\" Not to mention some of the mysteriously similar words. Look here:(From Eragon) (From Tolkien)Ardwen ..... ArwenFurnost ..... FornostIsenstar ..... Isengard...And many more. There's also TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION!!!There's a chapter in the book called \\"Saddlemaking.\\" All the chapter is about is describing how the character makes a saddle, but the readers aren't supposed to learn how to make a saddle...They're supposed to see whether or not the saddle will even make a slight difference in the hero's quest. If you've read The Lord of the Rings, please don't read this. It's like re-reading the classic works. The only difference is that this time, it was written by a fifteen-year old kid who just manipulated other classic writers' ideas. For example: In Eragon, there's a place called Gil'ead, only that word was already used in Stephen King's novel, The Gunslinger (only without the apostrophe, big deal). Please don't read this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think this book is very interesting.

I love fantasy series and have read all of Tolkein, Brooks, McKiernan, and even Jordan (end the series Robert!!). I read the books because they are entertaining. Do I know what is going to happen? Yes. Is there going to be a completely new twist on the idea? Probably not in this genre, although the Runelords (David Farland) and Witch series (James Clemens) come close. It's rare.This book has a hero, villain, troubling times, and a noble goal of protecting the helpless. The fate of the world relies on the shoulders of a reluctant hero. What else do you want? It is written well. You can read it easily and although there are a lot of characters, it is easy to keep track of them.For people who are looking for an enjoyable read, pick this up.

The multiple versions of said thing did make me angry at times but i might have been able to look past it had the book been original. I'm a fan of fantasy and all, but eventually the same plot can get old. I would have liked to see a few less $20 words and a few more $2 words. Some people might have to go and get a dictionary every other sentence. It's just as easy to get the point across without the crazy descriptions and what-not. I must say that Christopher Paolini does show some promise however. If he can get over making readers feel stupid when they have to sound out half the words on a page, and can decide on a plot and stick with it, then it is possible that the next books could be good reads. I'll probably read them nonetheless because i have nothing better to do, but i would like to be a tad bit more interested.

There was a classmate of mine (a rather antisocial fellow) who, whenever given a writing assignment, would litter his essay, story, or whatever it was with an exorbitant amount of ridiculously difficult words (I tend to think that maybe he made them up). While the plots of his stories and the main points of his essays were asinine, he was regarded, in this wonderfully lucid seventh grade classroom, as a literary genius. Meanwhile, I realized full well that he sucked and that no one in the class even knew what the hell he was talking about. (And yet, I was accused of being the one who \\"didn't get it\\".)Similarly, Christopher Paolini tries to distract the reader from his silly and manufactured plot by getting caught up with an annoying amount of description and big words. He fails in his attempt, however, as it only reveals his amateurishness. Furthermore, I hope that you notice each positive editoral review mentions his young age. Hm...sounds like a mercy review to me. Also, as in the story I mentioned above, ignorant young children are hailing Paolini as the greatest literary master of his time (usually by stating the words, \\"THIS B00K ROX!!!\\"). What they fail to realize, however, is what actually makes a literary genius. And Christopher Paolini, I'm afraid, is not one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"According to the book cover and some of the accompanying acknowledgments the book was written by a young man, starting at the age of 15. I'm amazed. While I thought the book was rather wordy, I can't fault the author for his stunning descriptive narrative and his polished dialogue. There was never a time when I did not have a complete visual take on where I was and what was going on there. Furthermore the vocabulary was amazing, meaning that there was very little sense of monotony or repetition.Mr. Paolini also seems to have had a good overall handle on life during a period that might be described as mythic \\"early medieval,\\" where magic and dragons serve as the science and technology of their time. The \\"ancient language\\" appears to have a flavor of Celtic, possibly Welsh---I've seen some words like \\"tuatha du\\" in titles of chronicles/poems from the period--about it that ties in well with the notion of giants, trolls, mountain dwarves, dragons and elves.The action takes place logically and carries the reader through to the end smoothly. While I found the many episodes a little redundant for my tastes, I can't fault the degree to which they helped character growth. The appearance and demise of a number of the characters also suggested that the author enjoyed creating them but then didn't quite know what to do with them over the course of the narrative, so eliminated them. This of course provided motive for the central character and contributed to the force of the story--though it perhaps blatently manipulates the emotions--but I was disappointed seeing such carefully crafted individuals \\"wasted\\"--though certainly waste of good people happens in real life, which may have been the point of the story. My favorite character was the dragon, probably because I'm very fond of animals. For a character even younger than the hero, she is very sensible, courageous, and caring. The degree of her vulnerability makes her actions and sacrifices real and poignant. She reminds me a little of my Great Dane, Courageous, who also seemed wise at least to me.More than anything, I think the book shows that life is an ongoing struggle and that the valiant youth of one generation become the disappointed elders of the next. There is no \\"happy ending\\" or even \\"unhappy ending\\" in real life. The struggle continues until the end of time and \\"happy\\" is a relative term affected by a number of caveats. As Solon of Athens told Croesus of Lydia, you can't decide you are the happiest and most fortunate of men until your death. At best there is a temporary status quo that benefits one or another group. It is often that status quo that is upset by the anarchy of youth that leads to new growth and a new golden age. Perhaps in the end it is only the struggle that counts."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of the best fantasy books I've ever read so far. It has all of the qualities of a fantasy book I look for. Compared to Harry Potter it has a great story line with a quick learning character. It has battles, magic, dragons, and monstrous creatures. Christopher Paolini is one of the best authors I've heard of, because he uses great imagery, awesome descriptions, and he keeps you intrigued through the whole book. I recommend this book to any fantasy lover adult, teen, or child. I do understand that this is one of the best accomplishments among someone of young age. So if you love fantasy or you just want a classic in motion take up Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The prologue was gripping, the shade and the Urgals, I read this in the bookshop and just thought WOW! It must live up to the hype of this book. However unfortunately I found the book itself to fall down sadly. When I looked back at the prologue it seemed to me that when the author removed himself from the emotional situation in the book the writing was powerful. In the context of writing about Eragon he seemed to resort to emotional cliches which I found jarred at me.The concept of the book is fairly cliched. Now I don't necessarily this is a bad thing as there have been a great number of books with cliched plots which work just fine. However the constant use of cliched language and responses really do show a lack of maturity in the writing. It almost makes it, but it doesn't quite for me.I do think this is a writer I will watch for in the future, He is young and I believe the writing will mature and can only improve.This just wasn't for me, a young man and his quest with a dragon to overthrow the evil king (and a story by a bard right at the start of the book handily pointing everything out to Eragon - coincidence over cliche)Maybe next time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm an avid reader who enjoys all genres and styles, but when it comes to fantasy I was never really a huge fan. I read Lord of the Rings, and was put to sleep by it. Boring, overly long, etc. Only the characters, use of archetypes and moral messages are anything to write home about with Tolkien. Other fantasy I've read is the same way: It follows all the traditional rules and comes off as dull reading, to me at least. So when I received Eragon as a gift I wasn't excited. Upon hearing that it was written by someone so young though, I was more interested.And from the first page I was loving this book. It's actually fun to read, as opposed to the more \\"traditional\\" books. Though it borrows from Tolkien, Star Wars, hell even the Matrix it seems, all that doesn't matter because it's an entertaining book full of grandeur and wonder. The Dungeons and Dragons playing, middle aged grizzled fantasy veteran reviewers here bashing the book for being written by a 17 year old need to lighten up and be entertained for once. I despise most fantasy novels because their goal isn't to entertain, and forgive me for reading because its fun but that's why I read. Sure Eragon isn't original, but guess what: It rocks.

What a disappointment. It just goes to show that you need more than the stereotypical \`hero quest' parts to make a good story. This story is so obviously borrowed from the works of other writers (and movie-makers) before it; the author could not even come up with new creatures - instead falling back on dragons and elves. *Yawn* Frankly, I was not impressed with the writing, either. If I have to read a sentence three times before it makes sense, forget it.

However, fantasy writers can still be successful is they are skilled in either prose or storytelling. And there lies the problem with this book.I was not impressed with the book. As other reviewers have said, the book is so reminiscent of Star Wars and LOTR in certain places that it just makes me want to cringe. The book does not flow well, the descriptions are way to in depth in places (really, the book is not 500+ pages long...had it been properly edited it would half been about 250 pages long), and the whole writing style is somewhat choppy and unnatural. What I mean is, its as if this book was written by 100% effort and 0% natural talent, like an advanced computer scanned Star Wars books, LOTR books, and other fantasy works and then puked out Eragon, mixing story elements of the above mentioned an changing names here and there. I get the feeling that a robot wrote it because it is so unoriginal. Paolini, please, next time, don't write so mechanically, just let it flow. If you have true, natural talent, it should manifest itself NATURALLY!Don't get me wrong, I give two stars because I still respect Paolini for writing so young and trying so hard to become a known author. I think that its very like that, later on, Paolini will produce some solid work. But this is lame. You can tell it was written by a 15-year old. The characters are unnattractive and two-dimensional, and the author apparently has some strange aversion to the word \\"said\\". The ending to the book is so predictable that you're hitting yourself on the head with the book in the last pages, shouting, \\"Why? Why?\\"I think that this author should have started out working for a video game company writing storylines for RPGs. Its ok for RPGs to have hackneyed plots and storylines. Eragon would have made for a fun video game! But a book...sorry..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

I recently finished it the second time out of boredom from nothing else to read, and found it just as good.

Though the story takes place in another time, another world, and the characters face things no one, or very few, face today, it is easy to relate to.

Dragons, magic, mythical beasts, and a great storyline, which make this book a no brainer for kids of all ages. The book is about a boy, Eragon, who lives with his uncle and cousin. They are very poor, so Eragon helps to earn the family funds and food by hunting in the Spine, a mountain range feared by the locals because it is difficult to navigate, and those who head in rarely come out. One day, during his regular hunting, Eragon comes across a shiny blue stone, and he brings it with him in the hopes that it will be worth something. To his surprise, the \\"Stone\\" is really a dragon egg! The dragon egg eventually leads to a dragon, and Eragon's farm is attacked by stranger called the Ra'zac, who are looking for it. This sets a whole series of action filled battles, amazing travels, and daring escapes. \\"Eragon\\" is one of the best fantasy books a kid can read, and after reading this book, I would highly recommend reading the others in the \\"Inheritance Cycle\\". In my opinion, \\"Eragon\\" is the best book though. Don't miss your chance to dive into this great book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is clearly written for young adults and in that perspective, it's a wonderful book. It has an unpretentious, every-man writing style that makes for a good bridge for those who aren't usually into fantasy. While it can't really be compared to more prestigious novels, it does makes the fantasy genre much more accessible in my opinion.There's a lot of cynicism towards this book, which I don't understand. Yes there are many cliched moments, but no more than any other teen book has to offer. The hero and coming-of-age story are the back bone of so many classic stories.If you're reading this book looking for flaws, you'll certainly find them. However, the Inheritance series are for the most part well-written with a fast moving plot that makes it hard to put down."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Overall I loved this book despite some of the cliches. In my eleven years I have read thousands of books (a book a day) and this and its sequels are in my top 10I've read many of the reviews for this book and i'm appalled that so many people think this story is copied. People even go so far as to claim that Paonini stole the idea of elves, dwarves and urgals (orcs) even though they've existed in folklore and fantasy for hundreds of years. Reviewers say Paolini stole without even adding his own touches, but that is not true. In Lord of the Rings the orcs are mindless savages that love to kill unlike in Eragon where urgals are also scholars and philosophers.A common scene critiqued is were Eragon has to go into the Hadarac desert but does not have enough water. People say he could have just carried water with him although the book specifically states they cannot possibly carry enough water through the entire width of the massive desert and there are no streams they can refill their supply with. Many people say the author copied dragon riders from the Dragon Riders of Pern series (which I read and loved) although legends of dragon riders have existed for centuries before it was written. People say Eragon is a rip off of Lord of the Rings even when Lotr bases a lot of the races off of norse mythology. Some say the author spends to much time describing even though that is his style of writing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, for now, I've read only a small portion of the first book of the Inheritance Trilogy and I don't need to go any further to see that Paolini is not a particularly prodigal writer. It may seem like I'm judging but let's face it, if the writing does get better as the book progresses [which I don't think it does, judging from certain reviews], then the author is bound to edit the first part of the book during the editing process.I mean, sure he's homeschooled but I don't think that's an excuse. Almost every aspiring writer today learns from reading a variety of books and studying an array of writing styles. One can find better writers than Paolini on the internet!His vocabulary is...bad and that fact practically begs to be noticed, even in the first couple of pages. He begins a paragraph nicely enough and just when, I'm actually getting down to visualizing [and maybe even liking] it, a completely repulsive adjective or adverb pops up. It shatters the complete charm of the sentence and every time I read a paragraph, I cringe at least once.I don't think that Christopher Paolini understands that using big words doesn't necessarily make you a genius, or even that great of a writer. Classic examples would be of Meg Cabot and Meg Rossof. These fantastic writers use simple words and its those words that bring the whole book to life.However, I'm still willing to understand that Meg Cabot's books are generally light-hearted and comedic and so, that kind of language fits perfectly into that genre.But this does not mean that Paolini can't write using simple words because its certain metaphors and words that can bring a whole books to life. Just by using words that he is familiar with, he could make his writing flow and actually make visualizing the characters, less of a bore. Now, before anyone gets down to saying that 'hey! you're a kid, it's normal for kids to have crappy vocabularies and not understand big words', well, let me assure you that I have a sizable vocabulary and do not clutch a thesaurus to my chest when I begin writing, unlike Paolini.Now, I'm willing to admit that Paolini has a spectacular plot. Sure, it may be borrowed from other works of art, but then, it is normal for writers to subconsciously borrow from other books, movies or cartoons that they've seen/read. His world is interesting and so, are most of the characters.But no matter how you look at it, there's no escaping the fact that Paolini's prose is mediocre and that he just doesn't have what it takes to bring such an intricate plot to life."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book after hearing all the buzz about it. Being a huge fantasy fan, I was really excited to read it. Imagine my surpirise when I realized how much this author had ripped off some of my favorite fantasy authors including J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ursula Le Guin. He had borrowed so much material that I am surprised he was not sued for copyright infringement. The book was extremey slow moving with just a few interesting moments. I would not recommend this book. Instead I would recommend Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Earthsea."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a boy who thought his life was boring. Well, did he think wrong! He finds a blue stone in the forest and discovers a mystical creature in it. It was thought to be the only one left. It turns out that there actually was another creature in the hands of an evil ruler, Galbtorex. He sends soldiers to find the precious stone before it reveals its secrets to young Eragon. The fate of the empire is in his hands with an ancient sword, an old storyteller, and the stone. Or is it?The book Eragon was excellent. It is straightforward, easy to follow, and had great characters. In a way it is like your basic fairy tale but a lot longer and a lot more exciting. It isn't just princes and princesses. It is a remarkable journey and it feels like you are the characters. It is a story suited for all ages. And the adventure continues with the next book, Eldest.Hayden R.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm a little less than halfway through this audiobook and am finding it difficult to finish. The narrator has the potential for doing a good job, but his more \\"creative\\" voices are practically intolerable, namely the voice for Saphira and also the werecat.As far as the story goes, all I'm getting is a complete ripoff of Tolkein (elves sailing to the new land from somewhere else, dwarves, Urgals=Orcs), Anne McCaffrey, and Star Wars (if Brom isn't Ben Kenobi, then I'm a frog). There's practically no suspense or pull through the story, and - instead of REVEALING things - we're already given too much. A character shouldn't say, \\"Yeah, I'm not who I say I am, but I'm not going to TELL you my true identity right now,\\" you're supposed to lead us to believe a character is who they are, and dramatically reveal their true identity.Frankly, I'm extremely bored and it doesn't matter that he was 17. You can tell. I was writing stories over a hundred pages in middle school, but I'm aware they were exercises; not proper for publishing. Most people are too young at that age to have fully experienced the ideas and emotions they're trying to write about. Imagination can only take you so far, and then you end up emulating the authors you love and it's OBVIOUS.Anyway, I might have enjoyed this had I not read much fantasy before, but I have... so I'm not.It gets a big shrug of the shoulders from me."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit.

I saw the movie back in December before I had read the book, then after I read the book I thought that the movie was a real disappointment; honestly. Yes I'll give it a 4 because of the awesome graphic designs and digital effects, but the plot (I believe) could have been written much better, even if all people were only wanting to see was the fierce dragon and magic. I watch movies not only for entertainment, but I really care about the actual story and how it is written; weather or not it is written well and with skill.And I love movies that have layer upon layer of stories that will actually tell hidden meanings or cause the viewer to pause and truely consider those meanings, weather or not the meanings were meant to be extracted from the film; by that individual. And after reading Eragon, its a wonderful lengthy story that has very important details that help enhance the story telling, and I truely would have like to see that come out in the movie, but I'm only one person with only one opinion; that I think needs to be heard among the many other opinions that this world has to offer!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hi to people reading this review!Eragon is very good!!!!!!It's thrilling, and Christopher Paolini (author) captures you in the adventurous tale about a boy and his dragon.Have fun reading!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I debated about whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars, but think that it must be taken in context. The Harry Potter series blurred the line between adult and childrens literature, and perhaps that is Eragon's downfall. As a 42 year old, I have waited on tenterhooks like millions of other adults for each new J.K. Rowling book even though the series was orignially intended for children and young adults.Eragon had no such definition, I found it at Wal-Mart among the adult novels, not with the children's books. It wasn't until I read the back cover of the second book that I even realized that it was intended for young adults. Taken in that context, I feel that it is well written and will definitely be handing it over to my ten year old son to read.Being an avid reader of sci-fi and fantasy fiction, I was disappointed in the obvious similarities of plot, names, and situations in numerous other works including Star Wars and LOTR, but was nevertheless intrigued by the book. It was entertaining, and I had no problems getting through it other than the occasional grimace when obvious similarties reared their ugly heads. I would not reccomend this book to other hardcore fantasy readers.I would however, highly encourange young adults and advanced readers who are even younger to read this book, because I find it would be a great portal to the fantasy genre for younger readers. It is easier to digest than Tolkien would be for a 5th grader and might easily influence such readers to pick up more complex fantasy books in the future."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There is a small town named Carvahall in the heart of Palancar Valley. The mysterious Spine makes up one side of the valley. The Spine is a mountain range covered with a dense forest. On the other side of the Spine is the great sea. The Spine follows the sea all the way down to where the sea cuts inland. Few are those who can survive in the Spine for more than a day or two. Eragon is one of the few who can survive in the feared mountains. He hunts there for food for his Uncle Garrow, Cousin Roran, and himself. While hunting, a strange stone appears deep in the Spine. Eragon tries to use the stone to buy meat from the butcher, Sloan. Sloan, who lost his wife in the Spine and is terrified of the place, refused to sell to Eragon when he found out where the stone had come from. The blacksmith, Horst, comes in and buys all of Sloan's best meat, giving it to Eragon. Eragon brings the stone home and puts it in his room. The stone turns out to be an egg and hatches into a blue baby dragon after a couple of days. Eragon hides the dragon, which he names Saphira, in the Spine. The king, King Galbatorix, sends his servants, the Ra'zac, to retrieve Saphira's egg. They destroyed Uncle Garrow's house and killed Uncle Garrow. Brom the Storyteller, who lived in Carvahall, goes with him to help him seek revenge upon the Ra'zac. Along the way, Brom teaches Eragon the skills of the Dragon Riders. The Dragon Riders ruled before Galbatorix became king. A dragon egg hatches when the dragon senses the most suitable human or elf enters the presence of the egg. The Dragon Riders ruled through protection and fairness. All of this and much more was taught to Eragon. Will Eragon be able to learn the appropriate skills before the time comes to confront the Ra'zac? How does Brom know so much?I think this is a good book full of suspense and mystery. There is fighting and friendship. I think all of these are good qualities. I don't like the fact that this book is so much like Lord of the Rings at the beginning.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and mystery, because there is a lot of both in this book.

He becomes friends with the dragon and he can communicate with it just by thinking what he wants to say. He finds out that the dragons name is saphira. He becomes the dragon rider and has to stop evil dragon riders from controlling the world, so he fights many battles and uses a lot of magic along side his teacher Brom which was also a dragon rider.I like the way the author wrote this book because he didn't make it boring and just say Eragon was walking down a path very tired, but he said stuff like, \\"Eragon was running down the bumpy dark road almost collapsing\\", so that really got me interested the way he used a lot of detail that forms pictures in my head, the battles and important scenes in the book, it really makes the pictures in your mind gruesome."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ok book if your just getting into fantasy but it dose have many things in common with star wars, but im sure star wars has many things in common with its predecessor so shouldnt put to much in thatall i have to say is... im very disappointednot in the book the book it wasnt the best one ive read nor did i expect it to be, it was not however bad. it was slow i admit that but i like to look at it as a build up for eldest which was much better however many many reviews ive read here rag on the book for being so very much like star wars or other fantasy works. i only have to ask you to shut up. there are two story plots someone leaves or a stranger appears thats it its up to writers to bend these however they can he could have done better yes but for his first book i think he did rather well and if you say other wise, well stop reading and start writing and let us know how it turns out. the reviews also struck me as written by people who have never even seen the other books and movies that they claim eragon copies for instance \\"After getting the elf from jail (like getting princess Leia out), Brom dies.

The author may be 19 years old, but I soon forgot that as I read, and got into the universe of the story, and it became real. By the way, I read the beginning of the first Harry Potter book once, and soon stopped because I could not suspend disbelief and enter the author's universe in that book. (I would have loved it when I was 12). The Harry Potter books are limited to children in that way, whereas Christopher Paolini's book is not. There is one place, near the beginning of the book, that I wish the editing process had caught, when they are in the town of Yazuac, and the Urgal collides with Eragon, and they fall together on the ground, and without really explaining how, Eragon is able to get up and go help Brom without the Urgal killing him.

In this world there are dragons, Dragon Riders, monsters, and magic. In a small village there lived a poor farm boy. While hunting in the forest he finds a magnificent blue stone. The stone is really a dragon egg. When it hatches a man named Brom finds out and takes Eragon on an adventure to a new town; the town was deserted except for two evil monsters. Eragon discovers he can use magic, but it exhausts him quickly. During this time the dragon grew larger and its name is Saphira. They go to a new town to flee from two beasts called the Raz'zac. In the town there is a witch who tells Eragon his future. After leaving the town they arrive at Dras- Leona they stay there to get information on the Raz'zac. During their stay Eragon receives a sword from Brom. Eragon runs into the Raz'zac. Brom and Eragon now have to escape the Raz'zac. While resting they get ambushed and tied up by the Raz'zac. They were planning to kill Eragon, but when a stranger named Murtagh rescues them the Raz'zac flee. In a final attempt to kill Eragon they through a blade at him, Brom jumped in front of the blade. Brom died and Eragon got a new partner. They stop at a town near where Eragon gets captured and is taken to a dungeon where he meets the Shade named Durza who has also captured an elf. Eragon and the elf escape with Murtagh and Saphira. They decide to go to the Varden the rebellion against the Empire. When there the Varden leader Ajihad locks Murtagh in the dungeon because he is the son of a dragon slayer named Morzan also during the stay at the Varden strong hold in Farthen Dr the elf whose name is Arya recovers. She teaches Eragon magic and swordsman ship. The Varden notice that there are monsters coming close. So they get ready for battle. During the battle Eragon get separated from Saphira and finds Durza. They begin to fight. Eragon is hurt and is going to lose when Saphira blows fire to distract Durza that let Eragon pierce his sword threw Durza and win the battle. The next day Eragon wakes up and all of his companions are there.

The fantasy world is sort of a rip-off from Lord of the Rings, with similar creatures- elves, dwarves, orks, etc., though the Dragon Rider background/legend was pretty interesting. Eragon as a hero is not really all that charismatic or like-able, just sort of a bland guy that just happens to have a bigger fate. He doesn't grow too much throughout the book either, but the plot is relatively interesting enough to ignore his lack of personality."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ah, Eragon. The book I love to make fun of. After reading this book and dismissing it as a terribly written, if amusing, book, you can understand my puzzlement at the number of devoted fans there are. And now with the next book coming out, I fear that more people will fall into the same trap of \\"Ooh, shiny dragon cover!\\" After that, they have no chance.So, you might ask, what's so bad about Eragon? And why am I being so hard on the author, when he was only fifteen? Doesn't he deserve a little credit?Paolini does deserve credit, but not for what most people give him. He has clearly read an impressive number of classic fantasy novels. What is not so impressive is how he blatantly rips off every one of them.Yes, the stereotypical images of elves, orcs, and dwarves are a part of the fantasy genre. And I'm not saying, for example, that McCaffrey invented Dragons. But Paolini uses ALL the mechanics of her dragons in his book-- down to the smallest details like how potential riders stand in front of the dragon eggs, how the dragon chooses its own rider and name, the trauma associated with losing one's dragon, telepathic communication, everything. Try as I might, I could not find a single original idea that Paolini invented himself. And it's not like I've read every fantasy book in existance-- I'm only sixteen. But when I was reading Eragon, I recognized every idea and concept immediately. People having True Names and a language in which you can't lie? Wow, that sounds just like LeGuin's \\"A Wizard of Earthsea!\\" And I've heard people praise the originality of Paolini's werecat-- a talking cat that sometimes transforms into a boy. Well, it's odd, then, that I read about one of those just the other day in Garth Nix's \\"Sabriel.\\" I'm not saying that he intentionally copied all these ideas (though, his characters would undoubtedly be more interesting and multi-dimensional if he had), or that these authors were the first to ever think of them. It's just that I've seen it all done before, by better writers, in my opinion, and Paolini didn't bother to change or add to it in any way. So, while it is a bit impressive for one of Paolini's age to have such a knowledge of fantasy concepts, any fifteen-year-old with half a brain could have stuck them all together and put their name on it.And actually, he didn't even do a good job at that. The plot itself can be summarized by \\"Star Wars plus damsel in distress plus many, many inconsistencies.\\" One example of the plot just not making sense happens about three-fifths of the way through the book. Arya is slowly dying of slow-acting poison and they need to get her to the Varden as soon as possible. Eragon suggests that he and Arya fly there on Saphira, thus getting there much faster than they would be able to on horseback. The only problem would be they'd have to leave Murtagh behind. But then-- get this-- Murtagh throws a tantrum because he doesn't want to go to the Varden. How does that make sense at ALL!? It completely ruined the whole \\"exciting chase scene\\" because the entire time they were slowly riding there I was thinking, \\"Why is Murtagh still with you!? Just fly there, already!\\" And, indeed, Murtagh complains the entire time because he wants to leave. Paolini gives no reason for him not to-- he simply doesn't, because it would ruin the big chase scene. Awful. Then when they finally get there, Paolini conveniently forgets about his ancient language (you can't lie, remember?) and makes a huge deal about how the Varden don't trust Murtagh and how he has to get his mind probed.All the other plot elements and events are similarly contrived. When they have to cross an enormous expanse of desert, for example, Eragon makes a big fuss about how they can only carry enough water to last them one day, and it will take them two days to cross. This didn't make sense to me because they'd never had this problem with carrying water before. Paolini just creates a conflict where there logically should be none so Eragon can cleverly solve it with magic. And yet in other cases, when faced with a real problem, he solves it with unrealistic ease. In one scene, Eragon and Murtagh must break out of jail. Eragon spends more than a day trying find a way out of his cell. He finally manages it with magic. And the very second he breaks free, there's Murtagh, who conveniently happened to get out at the exact same second, without using magic, in time to shoot the guards! Whenever Eragon gets into any real trouble, he is conveniently knocked unconscious and the problem is solved for him by the time he wakes up. I just wish it worked like that in real life-- then I could have simply knocked myself out cold instead of having to finish reading the book.Even with all these badly written scenes to choose from, there is one that really stands above the rest. The battle at the end of the book has got to be the absolute worst \\"big climactic battle scene\\" I have ever read. Paolini describes many Urgals (his version of orcs) dying. He describes Eragon and Saphira flying around blasting stuff. But not once does he describe-- or even mention-- anyone on the \\"good side\\" dying. You assume that everything is going well for them. But then halfway through he tells us that the battle is \\"going badly,\\" and afterward, that \\"there were many casualties.\\" Huh? Because of this, the scene was lacking any sense of excitement or concern for the heroes that it should have had.Still, I might have been able to forgive most of these flaws, or at least gotten some small enjoyment out of the book, if it had other redeeming qualities. But here, too, Eragon fails in every respect. The characters are flat and lack realistic personalities. The only character who gets more than a line or two is Arya, the elf princess, and she is (of course) the embodiment of perfection. Paolini surrounds every mention of her with description of how shiny, perfect, and beautiful she is. After about the fifth description of how her eyebrows slant, it becomes quite irritating. All the characters speak in the exact same way, from uneducated farm boy Eragon, who can't even read, to old scholarly Brom. And don't even get me started on his \\"creative elven language.\\" Taking a bunch of english, latin and greek words, adding extra consonants and accent marks and putting an \\"R\\" or \\"A\\" at the end of each one is not the same thing as creating a language. Example: \\"knife\\" becomes \\"kn&iacute;fr.\\" \\"Their\\" becomes \\"theirra.\\" And no, I don't expect him to be able to create a realistic language at the age of fifteen, but he seems to be given credit for having done so.If you must read this book, read it for what it is-- something that should be parodied rather than taken seriously. This way, when you come across things like fifteen-year-old Eragon wielding a five-foot-long sword with ease and then storing it away in his pack, you will be as amused by it as I was. In that way, this book is priceless."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If someone had assembled a checklist of every fantasty cliche ever used in any work of fantasy ever written by anyone anywhere, it would've turned into this book.1.

Christopher Paolini has, I am sure, many fine virtues, and given enough time may end up being readable. That time has not yet arrived. If you had told me before I picked up the book that the author was 19 when it was published, I would've said, \\"Really? He was that old?\\" I know when I look back at what I wrote when I was younger it was... not great. Now at 34, and published, I can see the flaws in my earlier works. I'm sure Mr Paolini will do the same as he ages.For those who want good, smart fantasy for themselves, and even for kids, I HIGHLY recommend the works of Terry Pratchett, particularly Discworld. He truly deserves the title \\"wordsmith\\". In his world elves are mean, dwarves are fractous and religious and dragons tend to explode if they eat too much, get too excited, sneeze, etc.It's \\"real\\" fantasy.

There are always new worlds to be explored and new levels of style and skill to be tapped into. However, you need a certain amount of individuality to make a fantasy hit with me, considering the huge numbers of novels available, and in this I find Eragon slightly lacking.Paolini's age is certainly remarkable, and I personally believe this contributed considerably to the popularity of his novel. Otherwise, Eragon is nothing new. Other reviews call it \\"the Lord of the Rings for the younger set\\" or mention its similarity to Tolkien's epic vision, but if I were to compare it to Tolkien it would only be with shock. I saw similarities to orcs in the swarthy Urgols, and the elves with their pointed ears, white horses, superior weapons and overall loveliness and grace. The names in the map, like Isenmere, ring a little too true for my liking, while the fact that the book culminates in a battle against the Urgols outside of the white mountain city is just strange. Add the race of dwarves and Snowfire, the fastest, most beautiful horse the land has to offer (Shadowfax?) and you have a blend that is certainly unoriginal, if not outright ridiculous.If fantasy still has thousands of novels to offer us, Paolini certainly shouldn't contribute he gets his act together. Philip Pullman said \\"I read like a butterfly and write like a bee; if my story [His Dark Materials series] has any honey, it is because of the nectar I found in the work of better writers. . .\\" But what he took was the \\"nectar,\\" not the entire flower!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!! ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact \\"voice,\\" none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of \\"purple prose.\\" Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the \\"perfect\\" titular HERO of these books???Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things. Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works.

The writing is highly derivative and the characters are not well realized, but it's a story that a 10 or 12 year old might enjoy.

He finds a mysterious object, then later comes home one day to find his uncle dead. The house (and uncle) go up in flames, and the farm boy goes off with a secretive experienced old mentor. The mentor teaches him how to use a glowing sword. The farm boy also learns about the evil leader and those who fight against him.

The plot is old, old, OLD!!! Did anyone else notice that the plot is simply Star Wars set in medieval times? Eragon, the \\"hero\\" is extremely annoying and shallow. Another thing that bothered me is when they spoke first in medieval, then in teen slang. I also found this book to be EXTREMELY lacking in girl characters. The only female character (besides the dragon) was a silent elf girl who was in a coma for an entire half of the book! Pretty much the only thing that I can say for this book is that the description is awesome! I can actually picture a lot of the places without being bored out of my mind!

Capossere and a few others are saying. I have seen so much good, original material struggle to find a home or have to settle for small or e-publishers, I think it's a travesty that Knopf picked this up (although I'm sure financially they're making out very well).I really had to struggle to get through the first 20 pages, and I'm still skimming a lot of it, pressing onward because my 8yo is so enthralled and is begging me to become a part of Eragon's world. When Knopf picked this up (I think it was originally self-published?), they could have at least assigned an editor to clean up the prose. It's awkward, wordy, imprecise, and, in places, a grammatical nightmare. All the characters at this point talk exactly the same. I can't believe people are comparing this to Tolkien, whose command of the language was masterful; even though his characters were archetypes, you could usually tell who was talking by the turn of phrase. By page 30 or 40, a reader ought to be drawn into the story and begin to care about the characters, and I don't. If the story keeps up like this, I'm inclined to say there's probably 200 pages worth of story here that's been overinflated by the use of redundant adjectives and adverbs and ill-thought-out scene presentation.In reading the other reviews, I'm noticing that those who rated it highly are new to the world of fantasy. (I truly can't believe a children's librarian recommended it or nominated it for an award.) If you're literate in the fantasy world and have read Tolkien, Lewis (or Greg Farshtey, who writes the Bionicle novels, for that matter), this will be a big let-down in terms of construction and originality. If you're new to fantasy and have read a lot of other genres, you may still be put off by the awkwardness of the overall story-telling. If you're a precocious 8yo who likes young heroes, though, go to it.(One star is partially put in to counterweight the lady who accidentally put in 5 and meant to put in 2.5)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Everyone here seems to be extremely divided in their views of this book, and I'm afraid I fall in the dislike camp.Okay, let's start with the plot. I must admit it is quite enjoyable, if you are in such unlikely circumstances that you are both inclined to like fantasy, and have not read most of the modern classics in said genre; or, perhaps, you have to have read enough awfully-written stories to know cliches when you see them. Basically, Eragon embarks upon a quest for revenge against shadow forces he doesn't know much about, but which will undoubtedly have something to do with his 'mysterious past.'While most people mention fantasy books as inspiration, I find Eragon's plot more reminiscent of Star Wars than of anything else. There's the dead order of peace-keepers with amazing powers, the main character's mysterious past (Who's his father? He doesn't know!), the magical power, the old man with long-dead secrets of the past, which of course he teaches to this headstrong youth without really bothering about whether he's _good_ or not, and most tellingly, the destruction of the boy's farm and death of his uncle, which in both Star Wars and Eragon sets the main character off on a quest of revenge. Just thank heaven there's no C3P0...In terms of concepts, there are very few original ideas, either. Paolini draws from Tolkien's works, not just Lord of the Rings but background materials as well, and, I am told, Anne McCaffrey's (sorry if I misspelled that) Pern books. Personally, I can't stand McCaffrey's writing, which is why I can't speak for myself on that one. Anyway, all of the races are almost exactly the same, down to the origins of the elves across the sea (Tolkien came up with that one, folks!); while Urgals and the Ra'zac are original, as far as I know, they are shadily described. Indeed, the Urgals always remind me of the Knights who say Ni, a la Monty Python, which rather kills their potential as villans.Paolini attempts to make his world original and fresh by adding in what he seems to think is his own idea, judging by the care he takes in explaining it: an ancient language, a true language, with magical power. Unfortunately, his implementation of this idea has two flaws: 1) lacking a proper knowledge of the mechanics of language, he has created a set of _words_ with absolutely no grammar involved, so that to get across a complex idea you have to smoosh words together and hope that it works; and 2) the words seem to have been created by randomly pounding on the keyboard, and adding vowels where he thought them necessary. They're not unpronouncible, as this has created a tongue with a phonology similar to Russian, or perhaps closer to Czech; but I doubt that was intentional, as my high school is one in, I think, a little over fifty in the United States that actually teaches Russian. 'Brisingr' is a word that simply could not exist in any Romance or Germanic language, and, as I said, I doubt that Chris Paolini put much thought into making his language original (even Tolkien, a philologist, only used harsh Slavic sounds in his black speech, the tongue of evil) when all the rest of his work has little or no thought in that area. Originality, I mean.One more thing. Eragon is grammatically correct throughout, a fact for which I am thankful, but shows distinct signs of having been written by a ten-year-old - and yes, I know the author was fifteen at the time of publishing. So what? I'm sixteen, and I can still vary my sentence structure. Learning to do so was an integral part of my 7th grade English education! All of Eragon's sentences are short, less than a line long, and generally begin with either an article (a or the) or the subject of said sentence; occasionally you'll find another adjective there instead, if you're lucky. I have not noticed a single subordinate clause in the entire book, and have been appalled at the blatant lack of semicolons. Semicolons! What is the world coming to, if people can say a story without semicolons is worth reading?Still, Eragon did wonders as light, mindless reading material - besides, of course, the choppy writing style inherent in a book with uniform sentence structure and a dearth of semicolons - and so, rather than a one, I give it two stars out of five.P.S. - I haven't seen anyone else comment on this particular name theft, so I thought I'd mention it. You know the Bid'duam? Turn it around and what do you get: Muad'dib. Frank Herbert alone could sue the kid for plaigarism; I'd hate to see what the Tolkien estate would do if they got word."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. This book is a trainwreck. Where do I even begin?I'll start with the most obvious and egregious issue: Many, many concepts, character names, and place names were lifted straight from other and much better fantasy writers' works quite shamelessly. Not even \\"inspired by\\" type theft - blatant copying. A plucky female character named Arya, a mountain range called the Spine of the World, \\"Urgals\\" who are described suspiciously like the Uruk from Tolkien - all these and far more to list here were taken directly from much better fantasy works by the author. But most disgustingly ripped-off of all was the scene where Eragon touches the magical \\"stone\\" (dragon egg) and his palm becomes marked with a silver-white circle, thus proving that he is destined to become a great user of magic. Hello, Paolini: David Eddings called; he wants his original idea back. This book is a smorgasbord of stolen works. Paolini should be ashamed of himself for thinking that such intellectual-property theft is acceptable, and he should thank his lucky stars that other fantasy writers aren't more angry over his \\"borrowing\\" of their ideas. The professional editor who offered him a contract should be tarred and feathered. And he should refrain from selling fantasy if he's not already familiar enough with the staples in the genre to know when his clients are stealing ideas.Right, on to the next point.The language in this book - ugh, atrocious! The prose is clunkier than a pair of cement boots. I can't say whether Eldest and Brisingr are more palatable than Eragon in terms of narrative voice, believable characters, and non-embarrassingly-awkward dialog. I will certainly not be reading those books to find out. All I know is that Eragon is one of the most awkward books I've ever read. Paolini never deigned to use a serviceable word where a two-bit, fancy-pants, multisyllabic one could be found instead. This book was obviously written with thesaurus firmly in hand, and it suffers for that fact. It is not easy to read, even for an adult who reads for hours every day. I can't describe it with any word other than \\"awkward.\\" Some of the words that were shoehorned into Eragon can actually be found in another eternal fantasy classic, \\"The Eye of Argon,\\" although I believe they were used to better effect in that story. Enough said.Finally, everybody seems to psyched over the fact that this was written by a nineteen-year-old. So what? There are ten-year-olds out there who are/were more accomplished and more mature writers than Paolini is/was. Yes, it's great when any teenager decides to apply his mind to something other than smoking pot or playing video games, but that doesn't mean that the results will be gold, as Eragon shows. I am just mystified as to how this book ever managed to sell so many copies, being as poorly constructed and as blatantly stolen as it is. But then, the McGriddle is one of the most popular menu items at McDonald's. There's no accounting for taste. My point is, this book needs to receive less \\"OH WOWs\\" from critics and readers alike over the author's age when it was written, and more actual critical exposure. It does not stand up well as a work of literature - not even as *genre fiction,* which some critics feel has lower standards than that nebulous and vaunted \\"literature.\\" It is terrible, through and through and on many levels, and the fact that it is praised so widely because Paolini was relatively young when it was written is an insult to talented young writers everywhere. Kids can - and do - do much better than Eragon.I am giving this an extra star only because it has encouraged many extremely talented young authors to take their writing more seriously, and to look at writing genre fiction - or any kind of fiction - as a real and worthy career choice. Otherwise, I would give it zero stars if I could.If your child loves fantasy and science fiction, please buy them any of the better works that are out there. David Eddings' \\"The Belgariad\\" series always appeals to young readers; John Bellairs' \\"The Face in the Frost;\\" Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game;\\" Robert Jordan's \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" The list goes on and on and on. Expose them to quality writing, not the awkward and self-aware prose of Eragon. Give them a true appreciation for excellence."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"So-I was looking for a fantasy/medieval title to read and after seeing the reviews of Eragon I said to myself \\"it couldn't be that bad\\" or could it? Now given I am only 175 pages into the story and it is possible to become a great read (hey, the Red Sox won four in a row) so anything's possible. But now I will list my personal problems with the book although most of them have already been stated in previous reader reviews.1. Paolini's use of thesaurus driven vocabulary gives me the image of him sitting at his computer, writing the story on Microsoft Word, and hitting the Thesaurus button on the toolbar everytime he needed a neat word to fill in for the boring one he came up with - EX: Pg.9 - He uses 'conflagration' to describe the burst of color from the sun, which irks me as 'conflagration' isn't the best word to use in that sentence and in a fantasy novel the word just doesn't fit well - I think geological science when I hear the word2. The plot. O Lord where to start. Let me just list what he has stolen/borrowed/tweaked from other novels/movies.1. The name Eragon. The story is about a boy and his dragon and the best Paolini could do is replace the 'D' in Dragon with an 'E' - brilliant - also sounds a little too close to 'Aragorn' for me2. He lives with his uncle and cousin in an isolated piece of forest - much like Luke Skywalker lives with his uncle and aunt in an isolated piece of desert3. Eragon was left with his uncle when he was a child by his mother who disappeared after his birth (his mother's name is Selena by the way - I guess the movie came on VH1 while he was writing the book but anyway) - much like Aragorn from LOTR was left with the Elves and Luke Skywalker was left with his uncle after his mother's death4. Eragon's uncle is attacked and eventually dies because 'evil characters' are looking for the dragon egg - Luke Skywalker's uncle and aunt are murdered because the Empire is searching for R2 and C3P05. The idea that a nothing farmerboy saves the land is no new thing but in Alexander's 'The Tales of Prydain' an assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who lives with an old sage and a mid aged man, is spectacularly close in storyline when compared to the beginning of 'Eragon'.6. Brom is Obi-Won Kenobi - don't even try to challenge that7. Brom attempts to teach Eragon magic and in doing so tells him to levitate a stone from his outstretched palm using magic. Hold on let me ah yes - Yoda teaching Luke Skywalker to raise stones in the air and stack them upon one another using The Force AKA another form of magic8. The Dragon Riders ARE the Jedi and the Empire IS the EVIL EMPIRE and Galbortrix IS Chancellor Palpatine who in turn represents the SITH (think i got the name right) - I feel like I'm reading Star Wars but the blasters and lightsabers are replaced with swords and bows.-Let us remember I am only 1/4 through the book and might remain stuck there for it is painful for me to read a novel that is clearly a ripoff of many beloved stories already told. Now given, J.R.R. Tolkien did not create the idea of 'One Ring To Rule Them All', it is a Norse/Welsh mythological tale that was first an opera around the 17th century and Tolkien simply refined the story and indeed he did create a massive portion of the saga, but the center idea that drives the story, the one ring, is not Tolkiens, but Paolini must learn to write without drawing such a great deal of plot and characters from other writers. He was quite young when he began the book and it shows through his immature sense to borrow ideas and I will buy 'Eldest' in order to see if he has grown into his own ideas and own story"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, this book WAS a mixture of influences. There ARE a lot of ideas taken from other books. But that doesn't mean it's not a good story. How many books have been about magic, and look how well Harry Potter did! Basically, this book HAD to have been GOOD if it was on a best sellers list when there are SO many other books out there.A young man from a small town, Carvahall, Eragon just wanted to get enough meat to supply his family for the winter. What he found instead was a mysterious blue stone that would change his life forever. The stone turns out to be a dragons egg that EVERYONE is after: the Empire, those opposing the Empire, and all the evils that are out there. The Empire's servants destroy Eragon's family, and he sets off on a quest with his old friend Brom and his dragon, Saphira to face his destiny.There is a lot of description (besides Eragon himself), and the writing style is creative, but sometimes confusing. He seems to shy away from using common words, for example \\"said\\". One time the book even said, \\"Eragon bellowed softly\\"! The battle scenes are full of action, perhaps TOO full. You lose the rest of the scene when he just decribes what happens. Eragon's always knocked unconscious, with Saphira to save him. I like how the book doesn't JUST focus on Eragon's deeds.Overall, a good book for anyone with a high reading comprehension, and a rainy weekend. YOu must have patience, or else skip over the description. I can't wait for Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a difficult book to review. However, I will try to make my comments as helpful and balanced as possible - fully aware that many may well disagree.When I read that this book had been written by an Author aged fifteen (when he started), I approached it with enthusiasm - and an open mind. Surely, I thought, for it to get published, it must be way beyond the talents of most young writers. In many ways it is; I certainly cannot imagine many people of that age having the patience to write something of this length. So, five stars for effort!However, I have not awarded this book five stars. Why? Well, although an excellent effort for one so young, it undoubtedly reads as the work of an immature writer with much still to learn ... and when I pay good money for a book, I would prefer not to be reading someone's apprenticeship material, no matter how valiant the attempt. There are countless other reviews all saying the same kind of thing and quoting specific examples of immature writing style - so I won't bother to do the same. I just genuinely wish I'd taken notice of them, instead of being lured by the marketing - and a nicely illustrated front cover.Undoubtedly, this young man is a bookseller's/marketer's dream. In interviews he comes over as intelligent and engaging. And this is, at least partly, what is helping to sell what would otherwise be a rather amateurish and overlong book. At several stages whilst reading, I tried to analyze how it got as far as publication. I later learnt that this was initially a vanity publishing project (self-published), and after an enthusiastic response (probably as a result of vigorously publicizing the youth of the author), a legitimate publisher bought the rights, (no doubt thinking they might as well have the profit as the author).Now I understood. There is always a problem when this situation occurs; it is usually published by the new publisher in its original state - rather than having the enormous benefit of a thorough editing. Tightening Eragon by about a third could have worked wonders alone - but that would be just the beginning. Considerable improvements are needed with regard to plot (too dull and predictable), pacing (waaaaay too long and slow), characterization (too many characters distinctly two-dimensional) and lacking originality (nearly everything in this book has been done before by somebody else - and done far, far better).No doubt, the next epistle in this series will be a huge improvement. The young author will hopefully have developed and honed his craft - and a second book will have the benefit of the editing process. But meanwhile, if you're thinking of buying this book here's my advice:If you are the type of reader who when offered an epic meandering tale about knights and dragons, will cheer, grab it with both hands and gobble your way through it - no matter what the quality; then go ahead and buy it - this book is for you. However, if you are a discerning reader with limited time, then I heartily recommend buying something else (preferably shorter). There are plenty of debut novelists out there who have spent many years honing their skills before expecting customers to part with their hard-earned cash; try one of their books instead."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The fanfare and general idolation of this novel is decidedly undeserved. Why? At points it can be entertaining (though it drags on in description far too often) but it is not long before an odd sense of familiarity sinks in: a sensation of deja-vu begs you to find its source.And find it you shall. Nothing in this book is original, each idea a poorly manipulated classic akin to what you would find in a slightly better than average fan fiction.What results is a kid trying to achieve the level of literary finesse that his presumed idols have achieved and abandoning the most important element of the writer's craft: creativity. By borrowing upon these well-known themes, characters, elements Paolini is only hindering the success of fantasy and other genred fictions. Instead of evolving these now overused and cliched ideals of magic and fantasy, he has left them unchanged.There is plenty of quality fantasy stories available that do not blatantly (no, it is not a cutesy homage to his favourite writers) steal the most recognisable elements of popular literary achievements.I can only hope that his next book will truly be his own and not just a compilation of the ideas of others."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I found myself feeling deja vu with this story and Jordon's first book \\"The Wheel of Time\\". I must say this book doesn't meet Jordon's standards. The characters seem stoic and two-dimensional. The conversations between Eragon and Saphira seem clipped like they were added as an afterthought. I was really hoping that the character of the dragon Saphira would develop throughout the story but was disappointed. She only seemed to be used as a living airplane who occasionaly shields Eragon from arrows. I felt myself cringe when the elf Arya was introduced feeling the beginnings of a Harlequin novel. I hope that Paolini takes care to add more unpredictable scenarios in his second book along with more personality in his characters."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is one of the worst books I've ever read.

Laden with overdone cliches and unbelievable heroics straight out of a adolescent's imagination, it came as no surprise that the author is a young teenager. My suspension of disbelief cannot bear a sixteen year old boy becoming a master swordsman in six months time, without ever enduring a real fight. Or an ageless elven beauty falling in love with same boy. I was constantly asking myself where all the MEN in this book were hiding. Anyone looking for serious fantasy should avoid Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have to admit, Eragon has a storyline that is its own, although a lot of concepts from it are taken from other fantastic books! For instance, in Lord of the Rings there is a character named Aragorn. Eragon...Aragorn...pretty similar. Also, when I read the beginning of the book (I couldn't even get into it) I immediately thought I was reading a Harry Potter book. There is also a book called Dragon Rider, which has a similar story. Has anybody seen the movie Dragonheart? It is about the last dragon...sort of like the dragon from Eragon.I'm sorry, but this book seems like the author wanted something to do so he wrote a book using ideas from other books in his spare time. The movie was, I have to say, entertaining, but I noticed too many similarites between that and Lord of the Rings. A few mild similarities are fine since eventually authors are bound to have similar ideas, but it was just too much! As I read parts of the book I kept thinking to myself \\"That's from Lord of the Rings.\\" or \\"That's from Harry Potter.\\" or \\"That's from Dragonheart...\\" etc. If this author wants to become successful he should create a story that is completely original.The book was also extremely slow. They walked...they fought...they walked...and walked some more...then they flew...with the occasional fighting. Even the creatures that followed them seemed to be taken straight out of Lord of the Rings (the Orcs), and that weird sorceror dude was like Sarumon to Saron, but instead this time it is a human king. Save yourself the trouble of reading this book by reading the originals that these ideas came from."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Anyone who gets to stay up later than 9 PM would recognize that this book stinks.

Yeah, it's about as cliched as one can get, but at least it's a pretty damn good cliched work. The author managed to actully make me care about the characters, which is not so easily done for me, and draw me into the narrative, which, for a 497 page mini-epic, was a surprisingly quick read. The discriptions in the narative were very nice, making it easy to draw it in my head.As for the stuff on the negitive side though, it's terribly cliche, with the typical Elves, Drawfs, Dragons, an evil lord, lots of incomprihenisable language and so on so forth. Add just about any fantasy cliche and it's probably in there.But thats it's only real downfall, and unlike some people, I never really tire of reading fantasy.I think it's an execellent book to bring a casual fan into the relm of higher fantasy.4.5/5"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved this book and thought it was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of the best books i have read. if u havnt read it i dont know where've youve been. oh well. the story starts out with a bang leaving you in question, when the plot shows you Eragon, a 15 year old, who is hunting when he stumbles upon a large blue rock, or so he thinks.

It's nothing but a passably written string of cliches wandering through a maze of better writer's ideas. After reading 200 pages I gave up in disgust. The publishing industry created celebrity status in the young author because of his youth and got away with it. But I do know young people who are very original and profound, even wise in their thinking. This book is excruciatingly UNoriginal, lacking in depth, and the style of writing is immature at best. Bottom line, if you buy it you're only proving the marketers right--that the public can be led by marketing dollars, even turning a silly imitative book like Eragon into a bestseller."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, I know a lot of people have said what I'm saying here, but I feel so strongly about this book that I can't help but say it again.This is one of the absolute worst books I've ever read.I have two basic reasons for this: the writing and the story. These two factors make or break every work of fiction, and Paolini has seriously failed at both of them.First of all, the writing. When you read a good story, you don't even notice you're reading anything. You don't register the writing. You just experience the story. In contrast, reading Paolini's writing is the figurative equivalent of trudging through a waist-high swamp. He throws adverbs everywhere, until I want to take a bottle of white-out and cover them up. I mean, does he think we can't get what's going on without an adverb after every single verb? Come on. Then there are his \\"intelligent writer\\" big words. Using big words doesn't make you smart. It only makes you look silly and your writing hard to understand. On top of that, he absolutely must describe things in the longest, most tedious way possible. And the worst part is that I could tell how wonderful he thinks he is just by reading the book. There's a very cocky quality to his writing that gets really, really annoying.Before everyone gets all worked up about how great he is for a teenage writer, let me say this: I know that writing a book is a hard thing to do, especially for a teenager, and I certainly give him credit for doing it in the first place. The thing is, published writing is supposed to be good, and that doesn't change if the author is young. So while I agree with the people who say how wonderful it is that someone so young wrote a book, I don't agree that he should be cut some slack for its deficiencies. If it needs to be cut any slack at all, it shouldn't have been published. Since it was, it has the same expectations as any other book and therefore should be judged like any other book.And besides, he did some things with the story that even a teenager should know better than to do. I can deal with the stuff that doesn't make sense, although that also goes under my heading of \\"Reasons Why It Shouldn't Have Been Published In The First Place\\". For example, the part when Eragon first makes mind-contact with Arya and, manages to tell her, in detail, where they are and everything that's happened to get them there, even though he only knows a few words in the Ancient Language. Things like that happen, and although there are a few too many of them in Eragon, it's not THAT bad.What's bad is the copying. A million people have mentioned this already, and I can't help but make it a million and one. I don't think there's one original idea in the entire book. I don't want to give away spoilers, so I can't make comparisons in plot, but it's obvious that Paolini stole pretty much his entire plot from other fantasy, mostly Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Star Wars. I can make comparisons in characters, though. Eragon is like Luke Skywalker, the headstrong young farm boy who's destined to be the only member of a lost order of peacekeepers. He's also like Frodo Baggins, the hobbit living in a sheltered world who's thrust into the conflicts of the larger world and finds himself playing a pivotal role in the defeat of evil. Brom is like Gandalf, the seemingly average old man who is, in reality, a wizard, and who leads Frodo on a quest to conquer evil. The \\"wize old tutor who's more than he seems\\" character has been way overdone, because Brom is also like Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts who doesn't seem like much but who's hugely powerful, and even more like Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars, who seems regular until it turns out he was a Jedi. Arya IS Arwen from Lord of the Rings. There's no difference, unless you count the fact that she can use a sword. She even looks exactly the same. Really, I'd think Paolini could do better than that. I'm a writer myself, and unless I'm writing fanfiction, I hate the thought of using anyone else's ideas. I go out of my way to be original, and I can't imagine copying stuff from other books and making money off it. I wish Paolini had a little more pride. He might be able to think of his own ideas if he tried, but somehow I don't think he plans to.To all the people who loved or liked this book, I'm sorry. I wanted to like it, and I even convinced myself I did, for a while. I love the idea of a teenager being so crazy about writing that he got a book published, and again, I'm impressed that Paolini wrote one at all. It's just that, no matter how I look at it, Eragon is awful."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I first borrowed Eragon from the library a few months back. I thought, 'the author's just a bit younger than me, and I'm stuck on the third book in my fantasy trilogy - maybe seeing what this kid can do will inspire me.' Or something.Lordy - I couldn't get past the first chapter.At first, I thought maybe I was just jealous of the author for doing what I hadn't yet done while being younger than me - though I didn't -feel- particularly jealous. Nor am I usually a jealous kind of person. But I couldn't quite pin down why I disliked it so much, and I disliked it SO MUCH that I couldn't bear to read any more closely so I could figure it out.So, I let it go. Forgot about it. Returned to reading Melanie Rawn.Then, a week or two ago, my sister buys the book. I've already told her my experience with it, but I play it like it was nothing (because I seriously thought I was just jealous of his success, even though I didn't feel it - yeah, so I apparently confuse myself), and anyway, she's desperate for a fantasy novel.She took the book to work with her. And when she came home, before I could even ask, she was telling me how much it sucked.After listening to her rant, I picked up her copy and read as much of it as I could stand. And we agree, now, on why it was so bad, and why it wasn't jealousy that motivated my initial disgust.The. Writing. Is. Choppy. And. Emotionless.(Yes, I wrote that that way to be ironic.)Seriously. I know run-on sentences are bad, but not all your sentences need to be short - and frankly, sometimes sentences don't fit together in paragraphs when they're short like that, because the subject jumps back and forth. For instance (and because I'm not sure quotes are allowed here, I'm not quoting it, but using an example I'm making up right now):>>Eragon's hair blew in the brisk wind. The wind came from the north. Barbarians lived in the north. The wind got sand in Eragon's eyes.&lt;&lt;See, now if you added the useless barbarian info to the previous line (i.e. 'The wind came from the north, where the barbarians lived.'), the paragraph retains coherency. (Not a lot, mind, but much more than it currently has.) Seperate them, and the whole thing becomes a series of sentences that are marred by one out-of-place line.Also, his usage of some words and phrases is, as far as I know, not quite correct. A 'torrent' of sunshine? 'Cheeks' flooding with tears? Someone 'diffidently' left, there are 'sheets' of snow, sleep 'overcame' him - and THEN he started thinking... There are so many examples of this, it makes my head spin.Also, he leaves details out in the strangest places... For instance, 'snow blinds him' - not the sun shining off the snow, but the snow itself. How? Does it blow into his eyes? Or is it the unmentioned sunlight reflecting off the snow?We don't know. We aren't told.Yes, I know one should show the reader, not tell. But in order to show, one must give details - don't leave the reader to do guesswork when it comes to what your lines are supposed to mean.And the wrong use of snow is not even the worst example of such a mistake. More than once, his sentences were so bad, grammatically speaking, that I couldn't figure out what he meant until I read further on and put the words in context. Which is something barely tolerable in a fanfiction author, let alone a published one.Also, some things just did not make sense to me - and not (only) because of bad grammar. (SPOILERS to follow!) Like, if his uncle is so grievously injured, why is HE the one rooming with the healer, and not his uncle? Though Eragon -was- unconscious for two days, the healer admits she can't do anything for his uncle, that his wounds aren't healing - but he'll be fine, she's convinced, because he's 'strong and hardy'. And she spent, by her own admission, a lot of time watching over Eragon, too. Not the man who wasn't healing at all.Yeah. He dies not that long after. Can they sue for malpractice on this world?It seemed to me like a really bad plot device - the author wanted Eragon to wake up and talk to the healer, wanted Eragon's uncle to die, but didn't bother figuring out how those two things could believably fit together.A lot of the book seemed pieced together like that, too - contrived ideas, with no real explanation of why things are the way they are, no real understanding of how to execute his ideas so that the reader understands.There's a scene early on, in fact, where two characters are said to be arguing (it's hard to tell from their speech, as the dialogue is stiff and never really changes to show emotions), but they leave the place they're in laughing together. No real explanation on why. Were they play-fighting? Did one of them cave? It's impossible to tell.The author's characterization skills are sorely lacking, and his ability to explain his character's motivations is almost nil. And it seems that nearly all the plot is given through speech - everything Eragon discovers he seems to learn through someone talking, to him or someone else. A well-loved plot device for all authors, to be sure, but must it be used so often?Also, and I can't really pinpoint why exactly this is, but I couldn't feel anything for anyone in the book. Eragon came off as an arrogant, self-rationalizing bore, and as far as I've gotten right now, every other character is flat and lifeless. The 'emotional' scenes are melodramatic (from what I've read, Eragon sure screams at the sky a lot - do you know anyone in real life who does that? Anyone?), with each 'touching' moment rendered utterly unmoving.People constantly mention this young man's age as a defense of his work, but I have to say, it's really no excuse. Not just for him, though he obviously could've done better; some lines hinted at an actual talent buried in there somewhere (not as big a one as he apparently believes, according to some published interviews, but a talent nonetheless) - but for his editor(s), as well, who should've seen the same errors I did. Who let these mistakes go by unchanged? That's what I wanna know.I wrote a book when I was eighteen, finished the next one when I was twenty. Does my age mean I should somehow be excused from basic literary competence? No, of course not. Which is why I'm still editing my novel, before I send it out, even though I'm twenty-three. (Well, that and a lot of emotional/family upheaval throughout the last three years, but still.)This book's publication does, on the bright side, give me hope. Because if this can be published, errors and all, I think I may actually have some small shot. >_&lt;Though to be perfectly honest, what really saddens me about Eragon is that, with so much praise heaped upon this utterly undeserving book, young Mr. Paolini, like all the most popular authors, has no motivation to improve upon his own writing except whatever motivation he provides for himself - and judging by his own published interviews on the matter, he believes much of his own hype, and will not be searching for improvement anytime soon. And that is a real travesty, because with effort, I think he might one day be able to craft an honest-to-God GOOD book.After all, as others have already pointed out, it's blatantly obvious that he's been 'influenced' by good books, at any rate. >_&lt;So, in closing: I found nothing in Eragon to recommend it. The writing is bad, the characters are bad, the plot is worse - and all these things are wrapped around a basic premise (farmboy finds dragon/power/world-saving abilities he never knew he had) so unengaging, cliched, and filled with suspiciously familiar ideas and names that one may spend more time trying to place various \`influences' than following the plot of the novel. Though admittedly, the plot is thin enough - and predictable enough - that following it is hardly difficult.The only real reason I hold out hope for Mr. Paolini as an author is that he has not yet written more than one bad book-Though to be fair, I have not yet read Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As you look around at the other, glowing reviews of Eragon, I hope you realize one thing: They are wrong.Paolini somehow got a glorified fan-fiction published-by his parents-and then miraculously found a \\"big time\\" publisher who knew how many people could be duped into reading a \\"fresh and original fantasy\\"Paolini plagiarizes:Lord of the RingsStar WarsEarthseaThe BelgariadFreaking Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher!He takes classics, rips them apart, and creates a Literary Frankenstine.

It shows that at least he has the tenacity and perseverance to keep at it, which is definitely something any would-be-successful author needs.However, I completely disagree with those reviewers who claim that looking at the intended target group of readers is an excuse for poor prose. There is never an excuse for poor prose! Our children have as much right to read well-written and beautiful prose as we (adults) do. Children are not second-rate people, so why should they need to read second-rate prose?There are many well-written children's books out there, but this is not one of them, although it does have certain page-turning qualities.

Tolkien: 'The time of the Elves has passed.\\" Christopher Paolini: \\"The time of the Riders has passed.\\" Hmmm. You may not agree with me, but I'd call that cheating in a big way. As a mother, I think it's too bad this author is getting so much press when what he did was quilt together patches from any fantasy source I can think of--books, movies, games--and the stitching isn't even very good. Since when is it 'classic' to take what others have done and call it your own? Although I didn't see anything truly original in this boo, having read other fantasy authors, I wonder how Paolini would feel if there had been something really original in his book and someone else had taken it and made a fortune off of it. Well you might not agree, but what should I say to my own kids about givin gcredit where credit is due?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think I can honestly say this is one of the worst books I have ever read. If Paolini ever learns to stop manipulating his characters, come up with his own storylines, and cut out all annoying, irrelevent descriptive passages, he might become a decent writer. As it is...If you are unfamiliar with Tolkien, Lucas, and Mccaffrey, Paolini's blatent plagarism may not bother you. Who knows, you might actually enjoy the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is interesting how readers either seem to love or hate this book. I was drawn to the book by the attractive cover. I got it out of the library and spent a few days trying to be interested in it. It was very easy to put down. The only reason I finished it is that I continued to read it hoping it would get better. It did not. This was written by a teenager, and it shows. One hopes that his next book(s) will demonstrate his growth as a writer. I must say I have sympathy for anyone who tries to write a fantasy novel which includes elves, dwarves and magic, because the book will inevitably be compared to Tolkien, especially now that the LOTR movies are out.However, in no way is this book \\"comparable to Tolkien,\\" or even any of the other writers to whom Mr. Paolini has been compared, at least in terms of writing style and excellence. The plot and \\"devices\\" are not original; the story line is VERY like Star Wars, and the dragon/magic and relationships are similar to those in novels by Anne McCaffrey, Raymond Feist and Terry Brooks (no offense to these writers). The writing is disjointed, uneven and dull. There is much extraneous information which the reader tucks away in his memory, thinking it will be used later, but it is never mentioned again. Nearly every chapter ends with Eragon falling asleep or becoming unconscious. I had to laugh at some of the lines, such as \\"White mist rose up off the river, like blood steaming in winter.\\" Surely that is something every reader can relate to (?)One can hope as Mr. Paolini matures that his writing will also. But don't waste your money on this book with a nice cover - get it out of the library or borrow it from a friend if you want to read it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"OK if you read the one-star reviews of this book, you will get the picture. This is one big fat rip-off, and anyone who knows the fantasy genre could have told you that.

Character interaction feels forced, and there is no chemistry.The worst part is the pacing. This book is a terribly slow read. I cannot imagine the story needing to continue over a part II and part III.I will read the remainder of this book to see if it improves. But at this point, I have to admit, the positive reviews puzzle me. This book is not what those reviews promised it would be."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My 12 y/o son loves this book. He cannot put it down and has read it several times.

Its sequal, Eldest, had plenty of views.Anyway, This the first book of the trilody, Inheiritance, by Christopher Paolini. I thought that it was a wonderful book!It's the story of a boy named Eragon, well a boy crossing over to man, growing up in this small village, with his uncle and cousin, Roran. The kingdom is ruled by a, shall i dare to say \\"evil\\" without making it sound corney, king.While hunting one day, he's shocked when a bright blue stone shows up in front of him. He is amazed by how hard and beautiful it is. And since it was the reason that he missed the deer he was hunting, he went with it to town, thinking that for sure this would buy some meat for his family. But the butcher refuses it, because it came from the suspicious, scary spine, the hilly country outside the village.Anyway, not to tell the whole book, but the stone is a dragon, and Eragon raises her, until the day that Saphira, the dragon, flies him away to save him from being killed by the king's soldiers. however, instead of killing him, they kill Eragon's uncle. And then, a local \\"storyteller\\" Brom tells him about dragons and the 2 flee from the village.eragon swears to get revenge on his uncle, but along the way, he learns to fight, and to properly fly on Saphira, so that he can truly become a dragon rider!!It truly is a great book, and worth the read.

He then finds a blue rock that eventually hatches out a baby dragon. Eragon and his new companion travel across a continent into the Unknown. He always has his enemies right on his tail. But he somehow always manages to escape their grasp and away from danger. The whole story has you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen.The author Christopher Paolini did a fantastic job with the storyline making it a non-stop action filled book. The book was so good that it was made into a movie, but the book is 100 times better than the book because the movie didn't even go by the storyline. The book may look huge but the reason for that is because of all of the great writing and action that is needed to make it such a great book.Eragon will be the best book that you will ever read.

I was interested in finding out what kids were so interested in, and I was not disappointed. This first work by Mr. Paolini was very well written, and quite detailed. As the story unfolds, several different story lines are developed, which enhances the intrigue. The characters are complex, and interesting. While this is classified as a youth work, it should appeal as well to adults who are interested in the fantasy genre. The action is gripping and will keep you very engaged in reading this to the end.The synopsis of the story, set in the mythical land, Alagaesia, is a young man from an impoverished family, stumbles upon a \\"rock\\" in the forest, which has mysteriously appeared. It soons hatches to reveal a baby dragon (\\"Saphira\\"), which then bonds to Eragon, our protagonist.

I decided not to read it, and checked out other titles from the library. Justin received the book as a gift, and during my recent business trip to Washington D.C. he consumed the work in a single day, and made it clear to me that I should read this book. I obliged, as the story (from what I knew) was somewhat intriguing, and after finishing it, I gave it almost a perfect score. Engaged by the author's wonderfully sculpted tale, I ordered the sequel, thus creating this dual review.When reading works by the author J R Tolkien, one is often bombarded by a world (Middle Earth) that has a complex history, many languages, and a detailed geography. Tolkien brought every bit of this complexity in his stories, and although incredible in the literary sense, and enjoyable to a degree, it always makes me tired when trying to digest the entire universe of information, contained in his books. Paolini, the up and coming author of the Inheritance trilogy (of which a third book has not yet been finished) has taken the complex world concept, and removed the unimportant stuff. His world has a detailed history, rich geography, and many cultures with their own languages, but these elements are slowly conveyed to the reader, and not set in the literary path to stumble over. He has formed one or two main languages that can be followed, some main characters in current events and past ones, and a compact slew of geographical locations that can be assimilated in to the imagining mind.EragonThis book opens begins the young boy Eragon, a farm boy living with his Uncle Garrow, and his cousin Roran, near the town of Carvahall. Eragon's mother has long since disappeared, and the identity of his father is unknown. It is a year before his 16th birthday (the year he becomes a man) and Eragon is already a skilled hunter, a capable and sturdy individual. In an attempt to provide his small family with meat for the winter, Eragon can be found in the beginning of Eragon, to be stalking a herd of deer in the mountains behind his home. Just before his arrow is released, killing his prey, a bright flash scares the deer, and he is robbed of his prize. On the ground before him, lays a polished blue stone, which immediately catches the attention of this curious boy. Eragon, while disappointed in his loss, takes the stone home, hoping to sell it for food.Eragon attempts to sell the stone, and is unable to due to the superstition and fear surrounding strange objects. When even a passing trader won't buy the stone, Eragon decides to keep it. In the middle of the night, Eragon is awoken by a loud scratching sound, which he soon realizes comes from the blue object. When a tiny dragon crawls from the shards of what was actually an egg. Eragon realizes the enormity of what he has discovered.Eragon lives in the kingdom of Alageasia, a kingdom that at one time lived in peace, protected by a group of warriors astride dragons. They were the dragon riders, and prosperity, safety, and justice reigned where they presided. But after being betrayed by one of their own, a rider named Galbatorix, they are slowly destroyed, and the age of peace slowly erodes into despair. Galbatorix takes the thrown, and for over a hundred years, rules with a cruel hand.When the egg hatches, Eragon realizes that he has been chosen by fate to be the next dragon rider, and that under his leadership, peace can once more be brought to Alageasia. However, the king has already sent soldiers to kill Eragon, and when they do not find him, they instead hill his adopted father Garrow, leaving Eragon with a desire for revenge. With the help of the local storyteller Brom, and with the intimate companionship of his young dragon Saphira, Eragon leaves Carvahall, to find the creatures that have killed his father, and to seek refuge with a resistance group called the Varden. Having become a hunted man, and being still a farm hand, Eragon is trained by Brom, who shows an unusual knowledge of warfare and magic, in the ways of swordsmanship, magic, and dragon riding and warfare.Having become a dragon rider, Eragon is blessed with long life, unusual strength, and the ability to communicate with Saphira telepathically. As he travels throughout the land of Alageasia, he meets many creatures, both friend and foe, and is finally brought to the far reaches of the kingdom, in the mountain city of Tronjheim where the dwarves live deep in the recesses of the mountain. With the dwarves are hidden the forces of the Varden, and Eragon finds himself accepted into this outlaw community as a leader and a warrior. As the curtain to this chapter of the trilogy draws to a close, the city is attacked by enemy forces, and a great battle ensues. This book leaves the reader with a somewhat peaceful conclusion, but sets the stage for many more adventure to come.EldestAfter the great battle of Tronjheim, in which the forces of dwarves and Varden are victorious. Eragon is hailed as a hero, for having killed the sorcerer in charge of the enemy forces. His victory over this dangerous foe is indeed great, but he is left with a deep wound running down the length of his back, that throws him into seizures when he over exerts himself. Eragon decides to travel to the northern woods of Du Weldenvarden, and to the elven city of Ellesmera where he can complete his training as a dragon rider. He leaves the mountains of the dwarves, and begins the long journey to the complete opposite side of the empire, having to travel by horseback, so as not to leave behind the dwarves and elves that accompany him.During this time, the reader is given a more thorough introduction to Roran, the cousin of the dragon rider. After the kings forces fail to capture Eragon, they turn their attention to Roran. Leading the kings troups, are the Raz'ac, strange and evil creatures, who are masterminds of strategy, and while not users of magic, employ sheer fright of their appearance as perhaps their greatest weapon. These forces descend of the peaceful town of Carvahall, and Roran is forced to lead the village to defend itself from the attacking foe. Repelled by angry villagers again and again, the Raz'ac sneak into the town, and kidnap Katrina, who is engaged to Roran. This is a deathly blow to Roran's spirit, but he is able to convince the entire village to journey with him to the lands in the south, in hopes of finding the Varden and joining forces with them to defeat the empire. Throw trial by fire, we soon see that Roran is a born leader, a powerful fighter (known as Roran Stronghammer) and that the people who once lived in peace, can just as easily become a formidable force.It is a long and perilous journey through the northern mountains, and sickness and misfortune seek to dissuade the people of Carvahall. But they soon reach the sea shore town of Narda, where they hope to employ a vessel to take them by sea to the country of Surda, which borders Alageasia to the south, and is in open support of the Varden. Fate seems pitted against them, and there is not a single ship to be found that can hold the 200 people of the tiny village, but Roran is determined, and an epic tale is formed from these circumstances.Meanwhile, having arrived in the great elven city of Ellesmera, Eragon begins training further in warfare, and magic. To use magic, one must speak a command in the ancient language, and the action which is performed by the magic, such as lifting a stone, withdraws the same amount of energy from the user, as if he were to lift the stone normally. These means, that if someone where to try and perform an act which he would not be able to do otherwise, the energy would drain from him, and the magic would kill him. Eragon, being a dragon rider, has an unusual amount of power for a human, but his greatest weapon, is the massive amount of energy that Saphira can lend to his power, creating a Rider and Dragon, that are almost and unstoppable force.Eragon soon learns to heal using magic, start fire, hunt, draw water from the ground, and even kill an enemy by using his power to stop their heart, or pinch off a blood vessel to the head. He is becomes and incredible swordsman, and a fast and agile fighter. Saphira, now almost a 8 months old, can breath fire, fly long distances, carry several people, and is both wise and powerful.The sum of these parallel tales, leads to a thrilling conclusion at the end of this book. Although most of the book is devoid of thrilling action on the part of Eragon, it takes you so deep in to this world, that the slow everyday life that you encounter of the elves is refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable. Paolini has worked very hard at keeping his facts lined up, so each new piece of information gained about the world he has created, fits perfectly into the puzzle, and brings a vast amount of depth to this book. The end chapters are nonstop action, and the cliffhanger at the end of the book leaves me yearning for the third installment in this series. I gave this book a slightly lower score for some of the characters I did not appreciate as much, and for some of the needless conversation"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed Eragon and the follow up books.

Did they really dislike all of the common fantasy elements found throughout the genre (not just in his writing), or do they think that, because he is young, \\"immature\\", and \\"inexperienced\\", that he couldn't possible produce something worth their time?\\"He is not especially ambitious, skillful, or possessed of any other trait that would cause me to take an interest in him. And he whines!\\"A quote from Mark E. Putnam's 1 star review of Eragon, in reference to Eragon.I beg to differ. While he might not show a highly ambitious attitude, one doesn't just wake up in the morning and halfheartedly hunt the Ra'zac. I would also say that holding his own in single combat with a shade, even with help, signifies skill of some sort. I would now bring to people's attention a scene which I think portrays an interesting trait. Eragon's controversial decision to not kill the slaver he meets while with Murtaugh (even though he has vowed to eradicate slavery from Alagaesia) shows a not at all boring side to Eragon. Also Eragon is a teenager and we whine sometimes.\\"...seeing this book promoted so heavily in every bookstore I visited convinced me that the price would be worth the reading. I was wrong.\\"A quote from Rumpled Sheep Skin's 1 star review.It was \\"promoted so heavily\\" because Knopf knew that CP's books would be popular. Perhaps not popular with condescending adults, but popular all the same all over the world with children, teens/young adults, and a fair amount of adults.\\"Finally, in response to a reviewer who said that they \\"have yet to actually read this book,\\" and seemed to have given it five stars simply because the author was young...frankly, that's a terrible reason to rate a book highly. There have been many young authors who actually wrote quality works, but this isn't one of them. I was disgusted to discover that this book's popularity mainly stems from the fact that his parent's owned a publishing company, and then heavily promoted this book.\\"Another quote from Rumpled Sheep Skin's 1 star review.Books shouldn't be praised or condemned because of any of the author's traits or characteristics, but other reviews give 1 star seemingly because of his age, along with made up excuses to try not to appear as a child-hating jerk (perhaps an exaggeration). I do disagree when Rumpled Sheep Skin says that the Inheritance Cycle isn't quality work, but more importantly if the author of that review knew anything about the early stages of Eragon's publication or publishing in general, they would know the following:1. Eragon wasn't popular until Carl Hiasen's stepson picked it up while on a trip to Montana, and brought it to Hiasen's attention, who then brought Eragon to his editor at Knopf.and...2. If a book isn't advertised a lot the chances of it doing good are slimmer. Sure early readers who think it is a good book could start a chain reaction, but if a lot of people become interested because of advertisements the book has a better chance of doing well.Of course Eragon isn't perfect, but than again nothing is. Personally, I think CP got closer to the mark then many people give him credit for.--Collin P. Dobie"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Loved this book and this whole series. This is an easy read and a very entertaining story. Our entire family has enjoyed it. In addition to a great story, there is love, marriage and the strength of family. There is bravery, courage and endurance. There is respect for, a positive relationship with and a learning from elders. There is true good and true evil, and the hope of redemption. The bad guy is not the hero. If you are looking for a departure from stories that promote drugs, promiscuity, bash religion, bash the family and that have no morals and no consequences this is your series. There are some very well written very negative reviews that are right at the top and that have garnered a lot of attention, but nearly 2000 'other' people have taken the time to write in their non-professional non-attention gathering way how much they love, enjoy and appreciate this series.I wonder why someone has taken the time and trouble to write such a professional controversial review bashing this book. I wonder why a significant number of people have bothered to give a negative reviews when the overall rating is so positive. Personally, I don't buy or read 400 page books I don't enjoy, or bother to write a really great negative review for them. The distribution of reviews is similar to the polarized reviews on a political commentary.

Regardless,it is an interesting and engaging fantasy and will take you on a fun journey. You'll want to read the sequels, for sure.As far as the audiobook version, the reader is wonderful - not a snoozer, keeps your attention with varying inflection and believable execution of dialogue.

I remember thinking the writing was great, the story super intense, the characters fully developed.Then I read Eldest. Then Brisingr. Then Eragon again. My opinions have...ummm....changed.I'll say first off that I want to cut this guy some slack. After all, he did write this when he was just 15, and that's pretty darn amazing if you think about it that way. But really, if you look at it from the viewpoint of one who has read a lot of really great literature, Eragon is nothing super duper special. Good, but...lacking.The writing is good, but it lacks life, meat. Paolini gets across what he wants you to see, but not in a way that gave me chills or made me want to live there or experience that world with Eragon.Speaking of Eragon, he's just average. I never felt a connection with him, through all the books. I liked him, but not enough to really care about him. I cared more for Arya and Murtagh. Murtagh is actually one of my favorite characters in the whole series, a great, tragic character who caught my eye from the first. And Brom...oh Brom. I loved him.The story is fairly good, but not as strong and original as I'd want. It was, however, enough to keep me interested and a couple of the scenes, because of their sheer danger and magical intrigue, really stuck with me. So, this book is worth the read, because it is good, and because the series just gets better and better.3/5 stars"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a fun read, but one shouldn't expect to read a brand new brilliant fantasy when reading it. While I won't go into how heavily this book borrows from other fantasies, I will go into some of its other flaws. That's not to say that because it has flaws it isn't worth reading, however. It proves to be good mind candy and a great way to settle down on a rainy day.Eragon is a poor farm boy who's out hunting when he finds a dragon egg. Not sure of what it is at first, he attempts to sell it. Being unable to sell it he keeps it and is very surprised when out hatches a dragon. He keeps her in secret as the empire would destroy him and his family if they knew they possessed a dragon. But somehow, they find out and Eragon narrowly escapes with Brown (a mysterious bard in the town)and Saphira (the dragon). He swears revenge on his Uncle's killers and he, Brom, and Saphira (although they meet other friends along the way)take off across the country in pursuit of them. But there are more dangers than that and he finds himself wondering if the Varden (a rebel group) can assist him and Saphira with their revenge.The characters are ok. There are a wide variety of characters, but what I find a problem with is authenticity. Eragon is supposed to be a poor uneducated, illiterate farm boy, yet he speaks like one with higher learning, possibly surpassing normal noble speech as well. The way he speaks just doesn't ring true for his character.The writing is VERY descriptive and flowery. This isn't always a bad thing, but it does bog the story down a bit and as mentioned before, makes the character's speech hard to take. The dialogues in the book are also very stilted and unnatural. Otherwise, the story as a whole is pretty unoffensive and appropriate for younger readers despite having battle scenes.I read this series for fun, not because I'm searching for some amazing piece of fantasy. And that's the way I think this book should have to be taken otherwise you could drive yourself nuts reading it.EragonCopyright 2002730 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini started writing Eragon when he was only 15, and it shows in his writing. When I first began reading the book, it was very intriguing, but eventually I caught on, and I realized that the ideas were clearly based off of Star Wars, but instead of being in a Galaxy far, far away, it was on a planet that had made up names for all the creatures. Paolini creates names very well, but it is easy to tell that a name is made up instead of a true name. Many times, it appears as though he threw a few letters together. The story line of this book is very interesting though. It begins with a farm boy, Eragon, that is hunting in the Spline, and he finds a mysterious rock. This rock is actually a dragon egg, and it starts his adventure. The kings dragon hunters hear of this, and begin searching for the egg. Eragons Uncle is home, and the dragon hunters search and destroy the house along with his uncles life. During this, Eragon is hiding with his dragon, and he goes out to find Brom. Eragon needs to create a saddle for his dragon, because the scales are tearing up his leg, so he requests that Brom helps him make one. They begin tracking down the Ra'zac (dragon hunters) and Brom teaches Eragon how to sword fight in case of emergencies. Eragon is the last Dragon Rider, and he needs to save himself. I don't want to spoil any more of the book, but if one must read it, it is very similar to the plot of Star Wars, except that it has older style elements instead of light sabers they use swords, and instead of the fighter jets, they use Dragons. I give Eragon a 3 out of 5 because it was worthwhile, and it gave me a new insight to teenage writers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an average book in my opinion. It's not bad and it is very fun. I do believe that it has some influence with modern cultural movies like Star Wars. I wouldn't say it blatantly ripped it off but it looked to be heavily influenced.The character Eragon I liked and disliked at the same time. I liked the idea that he grows as the book progresses. He is also willing to learn and he makes mistakes like any human being. The one thing that bothered me was that he was a little too righteous . He is the typical clich&eacute;d hero that would do anything to do what is right.Saphira, the dragon, I was a little disappointed in. I loved her in the beginning of the book. She was very colorful in personality. However, as the book went on and she \\"matured\\" it caused her to become very bland. She was okay as a character and I can tell she cared a lot about Eragon but how is it that she knows more then him even though she is younger than Eragon in age? She becomes almost like a god mode character that knows about everything that is going on. She too suffers from the\\" I am perfect and righteous syndrome\\" that Eragon does.One character I really liked was Brom. He was very mysterious and his personality was very entertaining. He was sarcastic, funny and caring all at the same time. I thought he was a more developed character than anyone else in the book. He also had his human flaws which only enhanced his personality.The other character that I liked was Murtagh. He was very mysterious and takes the \\"bad boy\\" role in the book but he doesn't overdo it. His only one flaw is that he is a little \\"emo\\" but it doesn't show very much. He is also very refreshing in that he isn't perfect. He doesn't believe in good and evil. His actions are only based on survival. He doesn't suffer from the righteousness characteristics of Saphira and Eragon. I guess the author is trying to show Murtagh as Eragon's opposite which is a nice touch. There is also a part of the book that obviously solidifies this.I liked the plot of Eragon. I have to admit it was a page turner. Paolini really is great at describing the areas that the character's visit. The plot is like a \\"Hunter becomes the hunted\\" type of description. The main highlight of the book I believe is the journey itself. It is interesting to watch Eragon go to these different places and interact with different characters. Though I do find it hilarious that Eragon loses consciousness at least three or four times in this book.I recommend this book to people that want a fun read. It is a great book to read to your kids. If you are okay with clich&eacute;s then this book is for you. It is not bad and if you are looking to pass the time then pick it up."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, is a very amazing book. It is about a boy(Eragon) finds a dragon egg. He, though, thinking it as a rock, puts it in his room and wakes up to find a dragon hatchling. He then finds himself in an adventure battling an evil king. With new friends, he battles with a sword named Zar'roc and defeats harsh beasts.

Uh huh, all that is true.What is also true is that this is a first rate first novel. I've read (and finished, more is the pity) much worse. It's new classical fantasy fiction. Yes, it derives much from Tolkein, Eddings, McCaffery, et al. And some folks are bored with that and looking for a new voice and are correct to say \\"don't look for that here\\".

I say this for many reasons, one being that the plot is very fixed in its place. Also, the tale is adventurous, exciting, and suspensful. I am an avid fantasy book reader, feeding on works by Tolkien, Lewis, Brooks, and others. I started off reading this book because I wished to support this young man: I have been homeschooled my whole life and I live very near Paradise Valley, so he was somewhat of an inspiration to me. But it turned out to be much more than just another book-reading. I found myself on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen to the characters. Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I cried. This is a very good quality in a book, one that is often overlooked by authors, making the characters in the story seem dull and super-human. Eragon is as like any other boy his age, even if he does live in an imaginary place. Readers can relate to him in many ways. Overall, this is an incredible book, one which I would highly recommend to everyone. Christopher, keep writing!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"WOW!!!

Eragon is by a young author from right here in Montana.&quot; My eyes widened as I fixed them on the great blue eye on the cover, surrounded by silver scales. A dragon! One of my favorite creatures in the known universe.&quot;Even though I only glanced through it, I am amazed at Christopher Paolini's use of words.

I am frequently tempted to stash the book away in my backpack, dispite my teacher's warnings.Someday, I knew it, I would find a copy of my own. I would never sell it.

When a stone magically appeared during a hunting trip to the mysterious mountains, which are known as the spine, his life was about to change forever. Bringing the big beautiful blue stone with him, Eragon had no idea what this stone would turn into. After a few weeks had past, late one night the stone began to shake, squeak, and crack and a dragon emerged. Eragon was shocked. Fearing that his uncle would not allow him to keep the dragon because if the cruel king Galbatorix found out about the dragon he would kill them, Eragon decided to raise the dragon in secret. Quickly the dragon, which Eragon had named Saphira, grew. Eragon did not know that his ordinary life was about to end.Eventually, the empire found out that the egg had been lost in the area and king Galbatorix sent two strange creatures to find it. When Eragon told Saphira about the strangers she kidnapped him and flew off with him to protect him. Despite Eragon's efforts to convince her to return to the farm so he could warn his uncle who was endangered by the strangers, Saphira would not return. Eragon was finally able to convince Saphira to return after they had spent a night in the spine. They were already too late. The strangers had already come. The house was already destroyed. Searching through the ruble that used to be the house, Eragon found his uncle Garrow who was still alive. Garrow was badly hurt however and Eragon had to get him to the town because the town healer might be able to help him. But when Garrow died Eragon determined to chase the mysterious creatures and seek revenge.After Garrow died, Eragon decided to sneak out of the house he was staying in and begin tracking the strangers which were called the Ra'zac. When Eragon was collecting the things he would need for his journey he was meet by the town storyteller, an old man who was named Brom. Eragon thought that his plans had already ended because he had been found out, but Brom already knew about the dragon and had guessed his purpose for running away. He offered to help. Immediately Eragon thought that it was a trap, but he soon decided that it was not. Traveling with Brom, Eragon soon realized that he now had magical powers. With Brom's help Eragon began to learn how to use his powers, as they followed the Ra'zac. Where would his travels take him? What would happen? Eragon had no way of knowing what would come of his adventure but he was determined to get revenge and kill the Ra'zac.

But once the Ra'zac come into the picture and the main character begins his quest, the story improves and grows far more interesting.I didn't find the story any more derivative than any epic fantasy tale will surely be in the wake of the grand sire of the genre, Lord of the Rings, and the story had enough uniqueness of its own to entertain.

However, as I read it, I kept sensing that it was obviously written by a teenager. The plot is basic and the characters lack a lot of depth - it just felt so predictable. Although my 12yr old daughter found it boring, I would definitely recommend to teen readers who enjoy the fantasy genre. As for adult readers, I can't figure out what all the hype is about."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This novel is a wonderful one, describing the events of a 15 year-old boy named Eragon. He was born and raised near the town of Carvahall, in the land of Alagaesia. When he stumbled upon a dragon egg while hunting, his curiosity got the better of him and changed his life of peasantry forever. Now a Dragon Rider, he seeks revenge of his uncle's death to destroy the King, Galbotorix, a former Rider turned evil and destroyed the Riders. Through his journey he is accompanied by the magician, Brom the Storyteller, and seeks to destroy the Razac and the King.He goes all around Alagaesia, from the city port of Teirem, to the mountains of Beor, hunting the Razac, and eventually finds them. Along the dangerous journey, Brom teaches him magic, fencing, and helps Eragon make use of his new powers with his conections to his Dragon, Saphira.The strengths of this book is that it is very easy to follow, and is very good when it comes to fantasy literature. It also uses a lot of actual English myths, modified to fit the story.If you loved J.R.R. Tolkien's \\" The Lord of the Rings\\", you will fall in love with this series of novel by Christopher Paolini.The weaknesses of the book are that many youth under the age of 12 will have a hard time understanding the morals and meaning of the book. It also is very hard to decipher many of the hidden meanings in the story. In many ways the story is like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars because of its beautiful description and storyline, and the worlds and places described in it.

Admittedly, by the fourth chapter, I was weary. There was hardly any dialogue, and while the imagery was vivid, some of the descriptions went on into overkill. However, this was not enough to feign my interest, because by the time Saphira (the dragon) was introduced into young Eragon's life, I was intrigued enough to commit to the lengthy novel. This was a good choice, because by the time Eragon is preparing to leave home and go on his journey, the story has picked up quite and bit and became thoroughly enjoyable.Eragon's journey with Brom, the old storyteller, is a fascinating and touching part of this fantastic epic, though no relationship in this book can be compared to that of Eragon and Saphira. She calls him little one, for God's sake. Very cute, and successfully shows that the dragons in the world of Alagaesia are not beasts, but magical creatures that may even be mentally superior to humans. The rest of the story, including the foreshadowing of a budding romance between our hero and an elven woman, an escape to a sanctuary (the Varden), two tragic deaths, and a war between good and evil.This book kicks off The Inheritance Trilogy with a bang, and overall, I have to say that this piece of work is a great book. Not only that, I must say that I envy the young Paolini for his mastery of the English language, as well as his vast and seemingly endless vocabulary. My one complaint, other then the somewhat slow start? Eragon falls asleep and wakes up about a million times over the cores of the book!Forget what everyone else says, pick up \\"Eragon\\" for yourself, and keep an open mind.

Intrigued that someone so young had published a book, I was compelled to buy it. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was surprised to find out how good it was. Paolini may be young, but he tells the story well.I'm giving this book five stars because--while one might find similarities between this and other fantasy works--you have to keep something in mind: What *hasn't* been done before? An author is hard-pressed these days to come up with an entirely original idea when practically everything has been done. Now really, it doesn't matter what this kid wrote about, people would still find something to pick at him for. It's a sad thing, but that's just the way the literary world works. In my opinion, this is a very good book and an excellent first try for Christopher Paolini. I sincerely hope he continues.I'm sorry for the people who are criticizing this book for it's similarities to other works. I'm sorry that they can only pick up a book to criticize it, not to enjoy it for what it is. People also do not seem to understand that this book was intended for young adults to read and enjoy, not--and I apologize for the stereotype--the 45 year old obsessed fantasy novel reader to scrutinize and crucify in Amazon reviews. It is unfair to compare it to master fantasy works, especially Tolkien--the undisputed master of the fantasy epic.Christopher Paolini is a very, very talented storyteller and I would really like to see what he can do with the books that are to follow Eragon.

I have some squirmishes with the editing, but all in all, the story itself isn't bad. That isn't to say, of course, that the book is downright amazing. In fact, far from it. Paolini is hopelessly derivative of older and far better fantasy novels (Lord of the Rings anyone?) That isn't the major problem because a lot of fantasy novelists have done that, but the best and most successful of them (J.K Rowling for example) have at least used these old ideas and made them new and interesting.

Movie?Gina Pozzi"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have heard from various sources that, although many of the ideas in Eragon are copied from other authors, it is possiuble to enjoy Paolini's work at face value. Unfortunately, I found myself unable to do so. I don't mean to sound like the average Paolini-hater (I would have given this book one star if I was), so I'll list several reasons as to why I had trouble with this book.1. The characters did not seem real to me. I found Eragon himself to be petulant and annoying; on top of his frequent narcalepsy there were unsettling characterizations. When he felt grief I felt indifference. He was not humorous or realistically courageous in any way. He made mistakes because Paolini made him make mistakes. I kept waiting for Eragon to come into his own, but he remained nothing more than a window through which we were able to view this book's not-so-terribly-original world.2. The dialouge. In what world- real or imagined- do people talk like this? What time period was the author trying to convey to his readers? In one line, I was reading casual, modern dialouge... and in the next paragraph I was met with medival jargon that seemed (to me) forced.3. The borrowing. Yes, I know i said I tried to take this book at face value. But the similarities of names (Paolini's Vanilor and Eridor to Tolkien's Valinor and Eraidor) astounded me. Had it happened only three or four times I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But if you browse some of the other reviews on Amazon, you'll see how many of Paolini's names are 'borrowed' from other works. I'm asking you to browse for two reasons: 1. So that you will see I am far from alone in this opinion, and 2. becuase i don't have the time to list the dozens (yes, dozens) of both linguistic and plot-related similarities between this and other works of the fantasy genre.Am I being too harsh? Absolutely not. Any published author, regardless of his or her age, opens himself or herself up to both positive and negative critisism the second the work in question hits the shelves. And how would I know what it's like to write a book at such a young age?The answer to this is quite simple. I am a sixteen year old high school junior and I have (gasp) written a book. Eragon was written for teenagers and when i first read it at age 14 I had exactly the same opinion of it as I do now. I am, supposedly, the target market of this book. If you must read Eragon, take advantage of your public library... or, if this book is for your children, buy instead Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card or the His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman. Both are quality, thought-provoking works with a perfect blend of originality and likeable characters."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It took about 40 pages for the novelty to wear off: yes, the book was written by a teenager and he can form sentences better than most teenages and even some adults. However, once you get past that point, you need a story, characters, and ideas that draw the reader along. For the first part of the book, I thought Paolini did o.k. Yes, his characters were two dimensional, his story derivative for Tolkien, Star Wars, and Harry Potter, and I couldn't figure out if Saphira the dragon was acting like a brat or was she the wisest character (she goes from pouty to tapping into her ancient dragon knowledge and making profound proclamations).For the first part of the book, Eragon is a capable \\"travel\\" book, with the characters zig-zagging from place to place all the while hunting the villians (who are also hunting them). Yes, all of these villians are straight out of the \\"Bad Guy Cliche Book:\\" they talk in lisps, they wear dark, black robes, and the main bad guy (Galbatorix) is a mad king that is never seen in the book but everyone discribes as a tyrant. (Of course, if he was so bad, I wonder why there wasn't more open revolt).Its in the second half that the book grinds to a near halt. I wont be spoiling things to say that the last hundred or so pages are exposition, as Paolini struggles to make the politics of his realm seem interesting. Unfortunatley, he is a young and inexprienced writer and he can't pull it off without \\"showing\\" you the problems. He is not subtle at all and the last part of the book is downright boring in stretches. He tosses in a battle in the end, but I felt that it was contrived and executed so quickly that I got the impression that even the author was trying to finish the book and move on.So why 2 stars? Well, I think the book is fine for people who have read very little in the genre (although I think the book is too violent for younger readers: there are decapitations, for instance). And Paolini does show promise. However, if you have read some Fantasy, Paolini offers nothing new and his clumsy execution had me wondering how if we would have ever been published were it not for the fact that he was 17. O.K. I don't have to wonder, I am positive that Eragon wouldn't not have been published.P.S. I have read that the book is being made into a movie and I just can't see how, not without taking many liberties with the book. Eragon is not a self-contained story, and the book ends so abruptly that I thought it clear that Paolini was concerned with establishing facts for the next book rather than wrapping things up."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a very bad imitation of Lord of the Rings. I bought it thinking that it was going to be a good and enjoyable book, but instead I've been reading counting the pages anxiously until I finished it. Will definitely do not recommend to anyone, and will certainly not read the 2nd book. You should go and read Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter which are books that you cannot stop reading... This one is not worth your time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a book which is getting a ton of publicity because it was written by a 15 year old. I wish that I had known that before I bought it, because I would have read it very differently and perhaps not bought it at all.Eragon is a heck of an achievement for any young person-- let's start with that remark. Literary judgement aside, Paolini created a 497 page novel that hangs together reasonably well at an age when many kids have trouble turning out a ten page book report. So, well done! There are many really nice moments in the book, and it kept me reading despite the flaws. He shows a real flare for writing about politics and he has very smooth and mature diction when he writes.However, as a fantasy read it leaves a great deal to be desired. It is clearly very derivative-- the sources from which it draws are barely disguised at all. The hero is unreasonably good at everything he does, and the dragon is very conveniently wise. Perhaps if you have not read the books from which this is drawn it will not grate quite as much, but in a writer of any other age the direct lending of moments from other writers would not have been tolerated.I am not sure that Random House has done Paolini a service by publishing this book. He is clearly potentially a very talented writer, and I look forward to reading his adult work when he is more able to incorporate his influences into his own vision. A book should be able to stand on its own without the corresponding footnote excusing the quality based on the age of the author. I hope that he is realizes that different standards will be required, once he no longer qualifies as a prodigy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon by Christopher Paolini is a decent start to his Inheritance fantasy series. The book was fast paced and flowed rather well from chapter to chapter, but I'm not sure it deserves a ton of praise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading it and enjoyed learning about some of the characters but the flaws and cliches frustrated me at times while reading.Eragon, a young man living in Carvahall, is out hunting one day when a great flash of light leads him to find an unusual blue stone. This stone actually turns out to be a dragon's egg, and once it hatches, Eragon's life changes forever. He is accompanied on his journey by a wise old man, Brom, who guides him through many trials and tribulations. Along the way he also meets some interesting characters in Murtagh, Arya, and Angela, each of whom I thoroughly relished reading about.The three main problems I have with this book are as follows: the cliche that is Brom, the useless journey Eragon and Brom go on, and the supposedly evil Galbatorix. Firstly, Brom is that character in every book that is old, wise and has many secrets. He only tells the main character those secrets when they are needed at the last minute because it is always thought that with too much information the main character, or Eragon, will make a poor choice or try to do too much with his powers. Brom is just too much of a cliche because of his predictability.Secondly, Eragon and Brom go on a useless journey to chase after creatures called the Ra'zac. I don't really understand why they do it since Eragon and Brom know that the Ra'zac serve someone more powerful. After a while the journey became frustrating to read about, but there is a certain part that Eragon's and Brom's journey ends and it was then that I really started to delight in reading Eragon (so please don't stop if you get frustrated like I did around that point).Lastly, who is Galbatorix? I mean, supposedly he is an evil man that rules the Kingdom of Alagaesia, but I can't put a face to him or know a horrible action of his against Eragon, which would lead me to dislike Galbatorix and root for him to lose. Not once does he show up in the text other than through stories told by characters. In Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, we don't meet the Dark One either, but at least their is the taint in the main characters powers that have him fighting the Dark One. In Eragon, Galbatorix has absolutely no role other than to set something up for the future, but how am I supposed to root for Eragon when I don't even know what makes Galbatorix evil (other than some stories told by Brom and the bad feelings Saphira gets whenever his name is spoken)? Rather than just stories, I need some sort of evidence, like a secondhand character saying that it was Galbatorix that forced him to do it. Unfortunately, I never got that and it hindered my enjoyment of Eragon.You might be wondering why I gave this book 4 stars then (after thinking it over, I actually think it deserves 3 stars, but that rating can't be changed), and it is because of a few things. The first is that I really enjoyed some of the secondary characters like Murtagh, (who is always grey, never just black or white or bad or good) Arya, (who is powerful and beautiful) and Angela (who is cunning and deceptively smart). The second is that I believe this book started a series that has the chance to be great by allowing room for many twists and turns in the future. The characters Christopher Paolini has included and the world he has created, I think, will lead to a great fantasy series. Lastly, I loved the ending to this book, but I don't want to give too much away, so lets just say that Eragon accomplishes a feat that few others have in Alagaesia, and end it with that statement.I enjoyed Eragon, even with the problems I came across, and would recommend this book to everyone. I look forward to reading Book 2 Eldest in the Inheritance series coming out on August 23, 2005.

The boy goes on a quest to save the Empire but honestly I don't know how this exactly go to be a bestseller, not to say I have actually read the whole book! Fantasy books may probably be not my thing but this doesn't seem to offer enough lessons or interesting views on things you relate to. The plot is slow and there is something kind of odd in talking to a dragon who speaks through your mind. This book is a failure and this is just a journey on a fantasy adventure. Recommendations on improving is make your characters more stimulating or engaging, make them with character or a little humor. Also, it probably would help if they would meet recurring characters that would provide comic relief.

Once got book I read and finished it in approximately one to two days."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon gets criticized for being \\"a ripoff\\" of about five different popular plotlines. But really, what isn't? Any story contains a whole gamut of things that mirror what happened in other stories. It's well-told, even if it contains elements that have appeared in other books or movies. The point of a fiction book is to be entertaining, and this does the trick.The first book isn't too difficult to get through (although if you're reading it aloud to a kid, trying to say some of the made-up words could be described as a form of gymnastics). I was secretly reading it through most of my English class in freshman year. (It was probably more educational than what the teacher had been jabbering about. That class was when I discovered my deep hatred for Truman Capote.)One of the general, unspoken rules of fantasy writing is that you have to be a little cliched to make things interesting enough (the reason they're used so much is because they move the story along!), and the better of a writer you are, the more you can used without the book being totally hackneyed. In this book, the writing is good.What annoys me about human/familiar relationships in fantasy novels is when the familiar is sentient, but totally subservient, all the time, and bows to the OBVIOUS SUPERIORITY *cough* of humans. Seriously... if you think animals think that way, let me introduce you to a cat. But Saphira and Eragon have a close relationship... which is difficult to describe until you read the book.There is some meat on the story. It's interesting, adventurous, and basically all the stuff people want in a fantasy book. Plus, if you're like Hermione Granger and use textbooks as light reading before bedtime, this will make the perfect mindless beach read.The thing is, if you're looking to go the entire series but get bored easily with crazy descriptions, I wouldn't recommend it. The first book, here, keeps the plot moving. However, I stopped in the middle of the second book because a) I couldn't get through the ginorma-mongous blocks of description with the plot going nowhere, and b) the library really wanted their book back. (Hint: Eragon stays for a long time in one place for \\"training\\" and doesn't really do much. But there are a few other characters that you also get to see in action.) But this first book can totally stand alone. It in itself is worth reading, and ties up most of what it starts.But I did hear that the ending of the series was really good--one of my classmates couldn't put it down. So I might trudge though the explanations of how the dwarven women \\"eschewed frippery\\" anyway. (Not kidding. That was actually a phrase in the second book.) Of course, that guy was the same dude who enjoyed Twilight, so I'm not entirely sure whether I'm prepared to take his word on it.--Lynda Yoder's 15-year-old daughter, \\"myexplodingcat\\""},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is definately worth reading.

The egg hatches into a dragon. Eragon goes on a journey to avenge his uncle's death. On the way he meets an old man who teaches him and helps him. With the help of the old man, the dragon, friends, and a little luck, Eragon may get revenge.Eragon is the best book that anyone has seen in a long time. If you like dragons, swords and revenge, this is a book for you. (Even if you don't, read it anyway because it's awsome.)My favorite thing about Eragon is that it takes place in old and \\"dragonlized\\" times. There is only one problem I have with the book: IT DOESN'T GO ON AND ON.If you read Eragon, you will have made the right choice. (After you read it, read the new one called Eldest, which is coming out August 23.)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After reading some reviews of this book I felt compelled to write my own review. First, the author was about 15 years old when he started writing Eragon; give him a break. Yes, there are some obvious flaws in the writing style and many of the themes are very similar to earlier fantasy works, but I don't read books just to pick them apart. I read books for pure pleasure (OK, occasionally I have to read them for college). In my opinion, the only true reason to give a book (fiction) an extremely low rating is if the book fails to accomplish its purpose; to entertain. I found Eragon to be thoroughly entertaining and can hardly wait for the next book (I have pre-ordered it).For those who say that the characters are too similar to already familiar characters - What do you picture when you think of an elf; a dwarf; or a \\"bad-guy\\" in fantasy terms? After you have done this the idea that someone else may see them the same way is not very far-fetched. The basic ideas of these characters have become so ingrained in our culture that it's hard not to think of them a certain way.If you are looking for an enjoyable read I highly recommend Eragon - great for all ages (I'm almost 30). Just let the fact that it is about 300 on the list of all books Amazon sells tell you what people think of this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The rehashing of every Fantasy gimmick under the sun--from Tolkein to Le Guin to McCaffrey to Brooks--got so grating after a while that I was relieved when I got near the end of the book. The characters fail to resonate (and why should they when they're carbon copies of other, earlier works) and never engaged my sympathy. The use of language was also a weak point, and especially the constant use of other words than \\"said.\\" when there is nothing wrong with \\"said.\\" Overly flowery and pretentious language was grating, with examples of \\"visage\\" and \\"raiment\\" and their like sprinkled throughout the book.Overall, considering the author's age, it's not bad as a first attempt, but there are any number of stories like it already out there by more experienced writers, not to mention on fanfiction.net. I would suggest readers interested in a good Fantasy book head towards the original texts instead of this derivative one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, a young lad of fifteen, is out hunting in the land of Alagaesia when something strange drops from the sky and catches the surrounding forest on fire. It appears to be a meteorite of some kind, and his family - not being the wealthiest in the lands by any means - might be able to sell it. So Eragon picks it up and carries it back home. But no one back home seems to want it.Then one night in Eragon's room, the little \\"rock\\" begins making strange noises. It turns out this wasn't a rock at all. But instead was a dragon's egg! One of the last eggs in all of Alagaesia. And the dragon inside (eventually named Saphira) has chosen Eragon as its rider; an ancient and noble distinction.Evil tidings are ahead for Eragon and Saphira, as the king of Alagaesia, Galbatorix, sends his minions to capture our heroes and bring them back to his castle. And these minions are horrible creatures: venomous Ra'zacs and wicked Urgals who will do anything to capture them. Eragon is forced to flee after a deadly attack on his home which ends up killing several people. But before he leaves, Brom, an old storyteller from his hometown, comes with him (this wise old-timer turns out to be much more than a simple wordsmith, too).Great and terrible deeds await Eragon on his journey. He must grapple with his own coming of age, his growing powers as a dragonrider, and deal with love and loss on multiple levels.What makes this story engrossing is Christopher Paolini's world. He's created a magical place with believable characters and interesting names. The fact that Eragon and his dragon can only communicate via telepathy is an interesting twist on an old theme (i.e., dragon/human relationships).Where the novel falls short is in originality. If you've read Lord of the Rings or The Dragon Riders of Pern, you'll be all too familiar with the storyline and its archetypal characters. The journey is pretty standard fare, too, but this young author has shown amazing promise for a first time novelist.Many readers have lambasted the author for following (or even plagiarizing) those fantasy giants who've come before him (J.R.R. Tolkien to be blunt). But many have followed in the footsteps of these giants. Indeed, most fantasy novels that came after master Tolkien's magnum opus dragged parts of the Lord of the Rings in with them. It's not plagiarism; it's reinventing the magic that these stories gave us and putting it into a new context. Oh sure, they don't break any new ground, but they weren't meant to, and I believe that Chris Paolini has done a fine job of pulling in many facets of previously done themes and putting a new character into their midst. Congratulations for that.What also drew me to this book was that when Chris Paolini first started writing this he was fifteen years old (the same age as Eragon, the hero of the story). Also was the fact that the author self-published it first, then got picked up by a large publishing house and soon after sold the movie rights for an undisclosed sum. Not bad, Chris. Not bad at all."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Very impressed with the writing and descriptive ability of young Mr. Paolini, however it took me forever to get through this story.

The same story with the same flavor could have been told on less paper."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I never heard of the book until my cousin bought it as a gift for me. I started to read it but it just didn't grab me. Then about a month later I picked it up again and started getting more into it.I thought this book was great, although it is not the most original book it was very good. The beginning may be a little boring, but once you read about five chapters it gets really interesting and made it hard to sleep at night because I couldn't stop trying to come up with ideas for the ending of the book.The book was not really the most original story, sort of a blend of Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings - still it was realy great and I can not wait for the second book Eldest to come out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My eight year old son read it from cover to cover and can't wait until the next one comes out.

He goes home and later to the market. He finds that the rock is harder than crystal. He goes in search of more information. When he gets home he finds the egg is shaking and the next morning it is gone ... and a dragon replaces it! He raises it for many weeks, then goes to Brom the storyteller for advice. The next day his house is burned to the ground, and he finds that the most unexpected people are warriors. He goes in search of revenge on whatever force did this.This book was written by a teenaged boy who is going to write a few novels in his time. It will probably inspire many young readers to become great authors. There will probably be good novels, bad novels, and novels that change the world (like Eragon). This book is an adventurous mystery with magic and swords, packed with ghouls, goblins, and creatures of that sort. It sticks to the reader like a shadow sticks to a person. This is a fabulous book that I would recommend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter (J. K. Rowling) and The Lost Years of Merlin (T. A. Barron). This is a wonderful book and I can't wait for Eldest to come out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While I enjoyed the story, this book had an all too familiar ring to it. I'd say that the first four or five chapters definately bordered on plagerism, due to the uncanny parallels they shared with Robert Jordan's fantasy series. Even after those first handful of chapters, I kept having this feeling that I had read this story before. Why? Because it was obvious where the author got his ideas - and, unfortunantly, they were not from his own head. They were from the minds of many great authors, but certainly not Christopher Paolini's.The other problem that I had with this book was that the characters lacked unique voice. Each individual sounded like the next, and their personalities were difficult to find. In other words, the characters felt flat, uniform and indistinctive.Aside from the negatives, it is still a fun and quick read. Especially considering that this book is written for children.Perhaps the young and inexperienced author, Paolini, will greatly improve over the years. And hopefully, find a voice of his own."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I realize that this book isn't perfect-- it is very obvious that he uses a lot of ideas from Tolkien (love the comment \\"I expected to see a hobbit\\" from one grumpy reviewer) and McCaffrey of the Dragons of Pern series. However, he adds just enough fresh ideas and a new storyline to a classic formula for fantasy fiction to be really, really good. His descriptive text and adult's awareness of what it is to come of age make it a really good read.I like that he gives credit at the end to the people who read over his text and copyedited, smoothed, changed and helped with his story. Another grumpy reviewer even gave him credit for having no typographical errors. :)This book reads quickly, gives appropriate hints where needed about relationships between people and situations, and then wraps up the details nicely when it's called for. I cannot wait for \\"The Eldest\\". Thanks for such an awesome book.By the way, except for Tolkien, some of McCaffrey's books, and the Harry Potter series, I usually cannot stand fantasy fiction because it drags on and on and on and assumes that you know everything there is about generations of people-- or worse, tells you about generations of people who are utterly irrelevent to the story. This book is different because it focuses on the story and blends in the past to make it work."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Originally posted at [...]:It all started with a beautiful stone. A stone that, as in all good fantasy novels, isn't quite what it seems. While waiting for a trader to come to town so that Eragon could sell it and buy food, the stone hatches into Saphira, a beautiful blue dragon. Discovering that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, Eragon is forced to flee his home and strike out on the adventure of his young lifetime.Having been thrust from his small-town home and out into the wider world around him, Eragon is like a country bumpkin visiting the big city. With the aid of his world-travelling friend and wizard, Brom, and the ever intelligent dragon, Saphira, Eragon and his companions are in a race against time. Despite being only fifteen at the outset of the story, Eragon is not afraid to do what needs to be done. Having worked hard all his life, he is the first to step up and do his part. He has the makings of a very fine young man and a true hero as he grows older and more experienced.Saphira, the only known dragon, choose him to be her rider from inside the confines of her egg. She waited many years for him to find her. More than anything, she is his guiding force and conscience throughout. Saphira acts almost as a big sister to Eragon, gently prodding him to stay on the right track, to remain, steadfast, and to have a little fun. In addition, she can keep him in line with a look, help him channel his magic, and crack wise on the most serious of subjects, given the opportunity. She is the perfect complement to such an inexperienced young adventurer.From the very first words of Eragon you will be swept away into the author's world. You'll meet dragons, elves, dwarves, and so many other creatures you never even dreamed of. You will also never know that the author was a mere fifteen years old when he began the adventure. Between the amazing world building, the flowing prose, and the dry wit, you will be hooked from the first page.

Also, the character of Angela, \\"the good witch\\" had a frustrating personality and I don't know why Eragon liked her company so much.The sequel Eldest bothered me more.

There are some who read fantasy books with a highlighter; grimly slashing through words and paragraphs with evident enjoyment. We see them, chuckling as they notice a lack in verbs, and in colons, in good vocabulary choice. Has any fantasy writer done this before? (which is a stupid question because, honestly, they ALL have), then mark him down. Ha ha ha. Never mind that almost every fanciful land in print includes dwarves under mountains, and Elves in the woods, THIS author is guilty of copying. It doesn't matter if the author was just 19, they dutifully remind us, \\"every book should be judged the same way.\\"There are other readers who actually want to enjoy themselves, and it is to them that I am principally writing. These are people who picked up a book for an adventure. And as long as they are entertained and at least a little enriched they are happy. They weren't expecting to get perfection when they picked up a book by a 19 year old. They certainly weren't looking for amazing sentence construction or good verb choice. They picked it up to read and have fun reading.To those people I say this. Eragon is enjoyable. While I don't whole-heartedly endorse it, it's well worth a read. Contrary to the almost exclusively negative reviews, there's a great deal of good in the story.Good Points: 1. Description is actually quite good. I was expecting a junior author to drop the ball a little in this regard, but he did very well.2. The dragon is very cool. It just is. The idea of being able to talk with a dragon in your mind is also cool (if just a little borrowed from other stories)3. The sections that show the friendship between Saphira (the Dragon) and Eragon are very good (such as the part where Saphira forces Eragon fly on her back for his own safety).4. The climax is really very good. I was a little tired of the book by the end, but the climax almost made it all better. Very well paced.Bad Points1. Granted, the plot is clich&eacute;d. I wouldn't assume that the author purposefully copied from Star Wars, but at least the beginning is so similar it's impossible to ignore entirely.2. The wise old mentor figure (and every fantasy has them, so it's not like this book's especially copying) is rather irritating. He's surly, and mysterious, often for little or no reason. In the end we think we like him, but we're not totally sure.3. Eragon, at least early on, is a brat. He needed someone to tell him early on that the world does not revolve around him.4. Magic/Moral Issues. Granted I know many of you will disagree with me here, but so be it. For people who believe witches are BAD (I happen to be one of them) the presence of a good witch and a were-cat is a little annoying. In the same vein wizards, spell-casters, and even sorcerers are entirely neutral. It all depends on what you choose to do as to whether or not you're bad.While I'm not real happy about it, I can swallow that pill. I can pretend that \\"magic\\" in a different world is different from this one. But when a character implies that even the summoning of spirits is neutral as long as you control them and not vice verse, the book has gone too far. I maintain that what we imagine in a pretend world creeps into this one sooner or later. When there's not a noticeable difference between spirit possession in a fake world and spirit possession in this one, I call it a little close for comfort.There is also occasional reference to the gods (whatever those are), which spoils any enjoyment we might otherwise derive from descriptions of a larger destiny. Thankfully, the gods are so minor as to be almost unnoticeable. But they are there, and my understanding is that they get more important as the books go on.5. There are parts where you can tell the story is written by a younger author. But this is only to be expected after all. The surprising thing isn't that they are there, but that there are so few of them.Ovearll: Overall Eragon is a decent read if you like fantasy and are looking for an adventure. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 13, but that's personal opinion.While I can't speak for any of the other books (because I haven't read them and may decide not to), Eragon's not bad. At the same time, I wouldn't say it's especially good. Bottom line is no one should read any fantasy until they've read Lewis and Tolkien and Lloyd Alexander. But that too is opinion."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recently read the book Eragon by Christopher Paolini. I found the book to be very descriptive and a great example of the fantacy genre at its best. The author really added depth to the characters especially Eragon Saphira and Roran.

It is full of elves, dwarves, dragons, and lots of action. But please, if you are an Eragon fan, or about to become one, please tell your friends and family about the Eldest petition. Eldest was supposed to come out this year (2004), instead of making us wait until 2005. August 2004 was the original release date, but the publisher decided to wait. Go to Google and type in Eldest; The inheritance Trilogy. We already have 4,700 people the have signed, but we need 10,000. Eragon is a great work of art and truly worth reading.

It's totally full of action with just a hint of some romance, but it definantly does not overdo it so you will not get bored. It's filled with everything a good story needs, dragons, elves, dwarves, a little bit of magic, a totally evil villian, and a hero you will just fall in love with. You would never be able to tell that he was only 15 when he started to write it. Whoever reads it will not be able to put it down, and those who haven't, YOU HAVE TO GET IT.

Eragon becomes the first Dragon Rider, a position of extreme importance and power, in a hundred years. When he is forced to flee the village he does so with Bram, the local story teller. Adventure and trouble awaits as Eragon learns more about his powers and the dangerous situation swirling all around him. This book is in the first in a trilogy and the somewhat abrupt ending might leave readers a bit frustrated, if wanting more.This book suffers from somewhat pedantic writing, but listeners of the audio will never know it. Doyle's narration is among the best I have ever heard. His deep voice, evoking the finest of English performers, is remarkably versatile as each of the characters has an immediately recognizable, and appropriate, voice. Doyle's narration is highly recommended for any, especially those well read in fantasy, who want to see what all the fuss is about with this bestselling book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is the absolute best book ever.

After a week or so the stone hatches, revealing itself to be an egg, into a sapphire dragon whom he appropriately names Saphira. Soon afterwards however strangers come and kill his existing family, sending Eragon into a quest than he had never even dreamed of.In conclusion this book is worth reading at least once.

When a dragon hatches from the stone, a journey of magic, sorrow, and destiny begins for this young, unknowing boy. In the next few months, Eragon teaches Saphira, his new dragon, all the basics of survival, and even more as she grows. In time, he encounters a distressing incident that will force him to leave Carvahall with Saphira, and trek throughout the world of Alagaesia. Brom, generally renowned to be a storyteller of the history of Alagaesia, accompanies Eragon in his perilous quest for answers to why he was chosen to be one of the ancient and legendary Dragon Riders. Throughout the story, Brom acts as Eragon's mentor of magic, combat, and perception.Christopher Paolini has created a creative, surprising, and stimulating plot for \\"Eragon\\". The different themes he puts into the story blends into episodes of both conflict and resolution. I would recommend Eragon for anyone who enjoys stories of medieval fantasy, unexpected incidents, and would understand a mystical imagination."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great book.

If all of the stories had to be completely different from one another, millions of great stories would be thrown away just for beginning with one upon a time or for having similar creatures. Almost every author in history has borrowed ideas from other authors. Eragon is in my opinion a great story with an equally amazing sequal. the villains are excellant, the heroes are likeable and there are even those moments that make your heart swell with tears.

Although I think he probably did have some help rephrasing some sentences here and there. There are just some expressions in the book that I wouldn't expect from a kid his age.

You start in one world and quickly gets drawn into a whole new world which consists of new languages, new cultures and a whole new dimension.

I liked Eragon, it had a decent plot, good characters(though alot of them) and very descriptive settings. You feel like you're there with him(Eragon) because of how thoroughly he gets into detail. This is good and bad though. It is long, and unless you love hearing about every detail in a certain field, or town, ect. It is very in depth but very long, veerrryyy long. Some parts were really good though, could be better, but is good.I think one thing that bugged me most is how he made Eragon think things no 15-16 year old would ever say(ex. \\"Where did it come from? Does it have a purpose?...Was it sent here by accident or am I meant to have it?\\" pg 11- Now what 15 year old boy would actually say that, middle earth time or not?) I don't know, maybe it's just me.Everyone is dissing the movie as well. I saw the movie first and that's what caused me to read the book. The best part of the movie is that is straight to the point-it gets where it needs to, when it needs to and doesn't stall to have two page conversations or setting descriptions. I liked that. But it did leave out many parts that should have been included and would have made it more in depth.I would suggest this book to anyone with a like for long books, and fantasies. Get past the fact that it's so close to Tolkien or whoever- that doesn't effect the quality of any book, it only effects the authors, ummmm... well where he got some ideas and took them into his own perspective.

I, for one, really love the Inheritance Cycle, especially the first: Eragon. Think about it. Most every type of plot has been written, so what can a writer do? Simple, take the most popular plots and mix them together: Star Wars + Lord of the Rings = The Inheritance Cycle! Of course, Paolini is still a good writer even if he hadn't done that. He adds plenty of original ideas and exciting plot twists. The descriptions are very vivid. You can see every detial clearly in your mind's eye. The characters are very well developed with real emotions and actions. The books are long, yes, but worth every minute of it.

You really feel for the characters and the issues that they are facing.I was entranced throughout the book and had to force myself to put it down on occasion.The basic plot, without giving too much away, is that of a young boy who discovers a dragon egg unbeknown to him. The egg hatches. This begins a series of events that result in him having to flee all that he has ever known for the first 15 1/2 years of his life. He enters into an unknown world. But he is not alone. An older man, a storyteller, leaves with him and they become companions.If I say much more I would be giving away too many details I think. Suffice it to say that you easily become trapped into reading too far into the night with this novel just to see what happens next.

Likable characters and a fast-moving plot."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love these books! They are a refreshing change of pace from the average world we find ourselves in today. They have a good, sometimes mysterious plot, a fare amount of action, and a nice sense of false reality. However, they seem to get a poor reputation from some people. Many arguments have been thrown against it, a few of which, I would like to discuss.\\"It's just a bunch of old stories thrown together!\\" - Most commonly, these books are compared to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. By drawing on similarities, people complain that the author simply stole ideas from these and other stories. But, such people overlook the fact that after seven thousand years of story telling, stories are likely to start sounding like one another. In fact, there are many similarities between Star Wars and LOTR, so one might argue that Lucas stole his ideas from Tolkien. That fact alone makes this a very poor argument against these books.In my own personal opinion, yes, this story does have similar elements as others, but no, it is not just a copy!\\"It's badly written!\\" - By who's standards??? I have read many novels of this same genre and I find that Eragon, Eldest, and Brisingr are very well written. Everything from scenery to dialogue is done to its peak! It's is easy to nit pick and find things that sound a little goofy, but one can do that in any book!Over all, this is one you'll have to decide on for yourself, but in my opinion, this story is written excellently! - I'd like to see one of you write better...\\"It's dry and emotionless!\\" - Okay, there getting desperate with this one! These stories have a good amount of love, hate, loss, hope, so on, so forth... What is you description of \\"emotion\\" anyway? Two people exchanging stupid love lines? \\"Anakin, you're breaking my heart...\\"This book has its share of emotion, if you can't find it, you must be blind to it.These are not the only complaints against the story, but they are the main ones that turn people away.

However, please keep in mind that if you are not a fan of sci-fi or adventure then this book will most likely not be your cup of tea."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Until I found the nerve to pick up this book and read it all the way through, I never quite understood what all the fuss was about concerning it. After seeing the movie, I ultimately decided to give the book a try.To my pleasant surprise, it was well worth the read. It's extremely long and extremely complex (sometimes you have to go back and reread a part at least two or three more times before you finally get it), but on the whole, I enjoyed it immensely. It's hard to believe Paolini was only fifteen when he wrote this. Sometimes I wonder how in the world he did it.I may give \\"Eldest\\" and \\"Brisingr\\" a try, but until then, I thank Paolini wholeheartedly for sharing his talent with the rest of us, and I hope he continues to write for many more years to come."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just finished the book and thought it was great. I've read the other reviews and am surprised that there are so many negative ones. I am not a \\"fantasy\\" genre reader in general so I really can't say if this book is a \\"copy\\" of others like people claim. Just reading the book as is, with nothing to compare it to, I really liked it. I thought the writing was way up there in skill and clarity. Compared to many, many other authors writing that I've read CP's writing totally trumps them. Some examples of who I mean would be writers like Stephen King, Nora Roberts, Stephenie Meyer, and Jodi Piccoult- which are the people whose stuff I've read a lot of lately. As for the Star Wars comparisons- I've seen Star Wars about 20 times, and I don't see the connection. All I can think is that the 2nd and 3rd books which I've not read as yet, might be why people say that, but Eragon really has nothing in common with Star Wars that I can see. The plot moves along, it's totally cool all the people Eragon meets, and I was consistently delighted with the story and all the characters that popped up.

One time of reading this book and ur hooked!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a fantasy novel by Christopher Paolini, a young and new author. This is his first book in a projected trilogy. It is the story of a fifteen year old boy Eragon. When he goes on a simple hunt to get food for winter, he comes upon a mysterious blue stone. When he gets home he tries to sell the stone, but no one will take it, and that night the stone hatches and Eragon discovers that the stone was actually a dragon egg. The birth of the dragon draws the evil servants of the king, known as Ra'zac. They destroy Eragon's house and kill his uncle. Eragon escapes with Brom, the town's old storyteller who hides many things from Eragon. The rest of the story focuses on their journey to seek the Varden, a group of rebels who fight the evil King Galbatorix's regime.Eragon is a modern day epic. It is a story of massive proportions, as is almost any fantasy. It takes place in the medieval-fantasy world of Alagaesia. As an epic or quest story, imagery and setting play a major role in the formation of the story. The story spans settings from the simple town of Carvahall, Eragon's home village, to the vicious Hadarac dessert, all the way to the Base of the Varden deep in the underground caverns and halls of the Dwarven mountain kingdom.Description and attention to detail also are large factors in this story, and any other fantasy. The races in this novel are very similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. There is Human, Elven, and Dwarven race. The three races are shakily united in an alliance against the dark powers of evil, their only binding factor. They fight a group of beasts known as Urgals, which can be roughly compared to Tolkien's Orcs, Goblins, and Uruk-Hai. These beasts are made to fight for the evil King Galbatorix, who seeks to rule all of Alagaesia.The story is the basic epic struggle of good versus evil. The hero is a young weak and inexperienced person who grows in power, knowledge, and strength on his journey towards his conflict with the great evil. The book sadly is not resolved, as it is only the first in a trilogy, but hopefully the last two will be as enjoyable as the first was."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I would not have completed _Eragon_ if I had not wanted to write a review. (I don't think it's fair to write a review of a book one has not finished.) The finishing, though, required considerable force of will. I did not enjoy this book.Eragon has many faults, but I'll stick with four: first, Mr. Paolini cannot decide what kind of book he wants to write - a children's book or an adult fantasy, a story in mythic language (Tolkien style) or in the more modern fantasy traditions. His indecision produces absurd combinations of language and event. For instance, the plot of Eragon is so transparent and predictable as to be surprising only to a small child. One tends to assume, therefore, that it is a children's book. Yet the author casually tosses in a bit of dialogue in which a female elf describes how, after torture, she was given to the garrison for rape. She solved her problem by magically making her rapists impotent. The language is terse, but the meaning unmistakable. This seems a bit adult for a children's book. In addition, the narration see-saws inconsistently between mythic language and modern speech. Paolini's attempts to describe events such as the one above in grand mythic language make the writing feel almost farcical. There's another bit where he tries to grandly describe how the villain kicked the good guy \\"in the fork of the legs\\" and un-chivalrously won a fight. If Paolini was sticking to gritty, modern fantasy-style narration, or if he was intending to write a parody, this sort of thing might work. However, in his high Tolkien-esque monologues, it sounds absurd. Sadly, this sort of unintentional farce is the _only_ humor in the book.Problem number two: Mr. Paolini would benefit greatly from Steven's King's short, but brilliant, manual _On Writing_. I'm thinking particularly of the sentence, \\"Adverbs are not your friends.\\" I grew exceedingly weary of needless adverbs tacked onto the end of every over conversation tag, (said the reviewer irritably.)Problem number three: the protagonist is stupid. He is so stupid, I hated him by the end of the first chapter, and he doesn't get any brighter. The dragon is actually walking around his room before he realizes that *bing!* the \\"rock\\" was an egg! Of course, if Eragon was _supposed_ to be a half-wit or a young child, this might work. Readers don't mind figuring out events in advance of an admittedly young or stupid protagonist. However, this is not the case. In fact, everyone is continually telling Eragon how he is exceptionally bright, and he is forever discovering new and wonderful abilities that he performs better than anyone else.Finally, \\"show, don't tell\\" is most emphatically not a phrase in this author's vocabulary. I grew bored to tears of his endless explanations - pages and pages of dialogue in which various characters laboriously map out for Eragon the hows and wherefores of his world.One might ask: if I found the book so distasteful, why give it two stars instead of one? The reason is that I do think the author has some talent, though perhaps not best displayed in a novel. In fact, this book read very like the script for a King's Quest-style role playing game. In that media, I think the story might actually be quite charming, and many of the more annoying elements would not survive the transition. But for a novel...? No.It is, of course, possible that the writer will clean up his style in a blindingly superior manner before he writes the next book (nothing is resolved in this one), but I wouldn't count on it. Nothing short of large amounts of money could induce me to read the sequel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Despite the heavy influences of Tolkien, McCaffrey and, yes, even Star Wars, Eragon manages to rise above copy-cat status as a well-written and very enjoyable book. I won't rehash the story line, as many other reviewers have already provided good synopses. Instead, I'll add that the pacing of the story was great, the writing was tight and intelligent, and the characters were quite likable and believable. Sure there were hiccups here and there, but to give credit where credit is due, the author has accomplished something most writers more than twice his age have not -- the publication of a rolicking good story that's on the best seller lists and quite in demand at the library. Eragon is an enjoyable and engaging addition to the fantasy genre for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Well, I can tell you that I enjoyed this book for cover to cover. The majority of the negative reviews appear to be written by people \\"in the business\\" and smack of petulant whining because they haven't been as successful. I've read Tolkien, Herbert, Hambly, Salvatore, Rowling, Zahn, etc., etc., etc. The book is good even when compared to these authors. Sure you can identify the influence of others, but why whine about it? Also, one major plot arch doesn't ring a bell for me as having been \\"done before\\". I read for enjoyment and I enjoyed this. Will it replace Tolkien as my yearly reread? Probably not. Will I read it again? Probably. Read it and form your own opinion, but I suspect that in the end you'll like it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think this is a good read. I think the real test will be the second book. It has the foundation to really be a nice series. If your looking for a good christmas present for your young adult that you can sneak a read also this is it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"No, I am not a sympathizier. I don't think that we should be soft on Paolini because he's young, and I don't think that because it's a young adult novel that the writing can suffer. I do, however, think that we are being harsher than we reviwers would be had this book been written by an adult.Yes, the writing is obviously juvenille. It is impossible to deny that the book is 'clearly written by a seventeen year old'. The cliche's, though, we may be going hard on. After all, elements like elves, dwarves, and dragons are so common now you'd be hard pressed to find a book without at least one of them in this corner of fantasy. Many books are rated five stars and are very 'Lord-of-the-Rings' sounding, the difference is in the writing, which I address now.To please all of the Eragon-lovers, I will compare the writing not to adult books but to writing by another teenager. Flavia Bujor wrote a book not to long ago, by the name of The Prophecy of Stones. Here are some common occurences:1) Both use 'big words' to make themselves sound smarter and 'more adult'.2) Both have bland or stereotypical charactersThe list goes on, but the general jist of it is that Eragon is an average book compared to other teen's writings. Compared to adult books, however, it suffers greatly. We have, however, targeted him more than we would adult books with the same elements, but different writing....But I'm in the middle of this one. I neither like it or dislike it. I'm getting the next book, and that will probably decide whether i go one way or the other.Here's hoping I lean to the 'liking it' side......."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, congratulations Mr. Paolini! You certainly wrote a wonderful book!I first picked up Eragon because I liked the way the cover looked. I have never regreted that move, as soon as I finished the first chapter I was sold. He has a way of letting you know just enough that you don't get frustrated, but you are still curoius. He makes you feel as though you are there, the chapter in which he first flies was when I truly noticed how I felt I was riding Saphira, instead of Eragon.I will say this book gets a little slow at parts, a few times you just say \\"C'mon! Keep going!\\" But it always picks up quickly again. Mr. Paolini makes the whole book seem real, from the way he describes the snow and the mountains, to what is going on in the story I can only say pick it up, you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first saw this book and what the title was, I thought, \\"Eragon?

Nevertheless, I read the book and I loved it for it's easy to understand writing and plot...I still think that with time and experience, Paolini could shine because he DOES have potential, but he shouldn't have written so early. Perhaps he needs to grow into his talent before he writes because although his writing showed promise, there were WAY~ too many similarities between his book and LOTR, SW Trilogy, etc...I felt like I was reading a fusion of the above mentioned fantasies (a quite MESSY fusion)...I'm quite sure you all know what I am talking about.

It flowed well and kept me riveted until the very end. I could not put it down, and was literally sad to reach the end of it.This book has everything that a young adult will love (though I am 31). Eragon, a simple farm boy, is suddenly thrust into an unknown world of magic and adventure. Faced unexpectedly with so much responsibility, we watch him change and grow into an admirable young man - all on the back of a dragon. Throw in some faery's, miscellaneous magic throughout, and good versus evil - and you have an excellent fantasy read.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To begin with, I had high hopes for this book as it was recommended by someone whose opinion I value when it comes to books and reading. I had seen magazine ads for the book, but hadn't even attempted to read a copy until it was loaned to me by the aforementioned person.I will likely be reading the other two books of the series and perhaps even more by the author, providing that he publishes more than just this trilogy. There is a major &quot;but&quot; coming though. While I liked reading this book, I was continually disappointed all the way through.The first part of the book is a little difficult to get through. While I understand and appreciate the fact that the author needs to lay some goundwork for the upcoming story, it all seemed so shallow. Just bits of information gratuitously tossed around. The framework definitely needs some work. I have to admit that it did get better as the book went on, but it still needs some work. I am almost certain that, with more practice, we will see some great work coming from Paolini.A little bit about a few of the characters:Brom: I was so disappointed in the portrayal of this character. This is someone that I wanted to be able to love and care for, but he was written into the story so badly. His dialogue was extremely poor and he wasn't given any depth as a character. This fact saddened me more than the fact that he died in the story. It was a bit obvious what was coming, but even his death was badly written. Very anti-climatic though what Saphira does for his grave was nice.Eragon: I don't even know if I care for this character, though he is the main one of the story obviously. I don't know much about him, his thoughts, his feelings, his dreams and desires. It's true that his character develops somewhat through the book, but I would need to know more about him to be interested in his adventures and fate like I would with other book characters that I've enjoyed reading about and getting to know.I'm also actually disappointed at his progress. It seems like he hasn't had to actually work for anything. Everything he tries, sword fighting, magic, it all comes to him after a few tries and he's &quot;master&quot; of it all. Come on, even a lead character can't be master of EVERYTHING.Saphira: By far the best character in the book. Sometimes I'm a bit confused at her intentions/feelings since it isn't really all that clear. The dialogue between Saphira and Eragon is the best in the book compared to the speech between the rest of them. There were even a few heartwarming paragraphs between the dragon and her rider that really just impressed me.During the book I kept coming across some references that I was sure I had read elsewhere. Like how dragons choose who they will hatch to and how children were paraded in front of the dragon egg to see if it will hatch for someone. I felt like the author grabbed bits and pieces from other works and just stuck them in his book. Not an entirely bad thing if you can put your own spin on it make it yours. Paolini didn't.Overall, I think that this book is decent for children. However, to the bit more advanced reader, you may be disappointed. I think this book could have been a lot better with more work. Hopefully, the rest will be better as the author matures and progresses as a writer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is not a particularly engaging book. First off, the author uses many, many synonyms for \\"said\\"- it is not a sin to use it once in a while! The plot of Eragon is rather similar to Lord of the Rings, the Dragonriders of Pern, and Star Wars, and the characters are flat and seem to be puppets of the author, going wherever Paolini wishes, with shallow, unclear motives. Eragon himself has horrible mood swings, going from happy to furious in a matter of sentences.When the uncle died, I felt no emotion and did not think Eragon would overreact like he did. At first I got the impression that Eragon did not like his uncle, but I suppose I was wrong. Still, was it not the writing's fault I had the wrong impression?Also, Paolini used a bit too much description- many readers *do* have imagination. I enjoy some description, but not to the extent the author uses.However, one has to give Paolini credit- he began writing at the age of fifteen, but that still should be no excuse for the things mentioned above. My question is: Would Eragon have been published if it had been written by, say, a fifty-year-old? Probably not. Eragon would have been a wonderful first draft, but still needs to be worked on."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of my favorite books.

His dragon takes him on an amazing adveture to try and help him master his new powers.THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love fantasy. It's one of my favorite areas of fiction. However, no one wants to hear my entire reading list (which will take PAGES) so let's go on.Eragon is not a great book. Before you Eragon fans jump me, listen to what I say first.1. Paolini's prose is. . .okay. There's no other word for it. Sure, he's an excellent writer for a teenager, but frankly, he could do with a great editor. He should know he doesn't have to use every synonym for the word \\"said\\" in his writing. There were some glaring grammatical errors that could have been easily corrected, and some parts were so awkwardly written that I cringed when I read them. Descriptions were not used well. I still don't know what Eragon looks like, yet I get tired of reading about Arya's beauty for the fifteenth time.2. The story lacked originality. I KNOW fantasy writers like to use elements from other writers in their writing. However, some could-be ripoffs become great, ORIGINAL books. A great example is the Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathon Stroud. Sure, it has wizards and magical relics like Harry Potter. The similarity ends there. There's an unlikeable, but realistic, adolescent hero, a mischievous djinni, a lively plot, witty prose, an interesting alternate London run by squabbling magicians, and a host of fascinating spirits. What makes this could-be ripoff great is ORIGNALITY. Eragon has very little orignality. Names and creatures, such as Eragon, Arya, Shades, and Urgals are eerily similar to Lord of the Rings names and creatures such as Aragorn, Arwen, Nazgul, and Orcs in that order. Languages are strangely similar to langauges invented by Tolkien, an ancient languages expert, and distract from the story so that people have to flip to the glossary to translate them. Elves are beautiful, ethereal beings who came from over the sea, and dwarves are short, bearded smiths and miners who live underground. Dragons and their Dragonriders are lifted from Anne McCaffrey's Pern. There's magical swords with names, a damsel in distress, ancient, grumpy mentors, companions with unknown pasts, and mysterious, missing parents. Sounds familiar? All these tired fantasy cliches are found in Eragon.3. The worst thing for me is characterization. I DESPISED Eragon. We never knew what went on in his head except when he talking with Saphira. I was so irritated with his disrespectful, immature attitude that he got away with just because he was a Dragonrider that I didn't care when he nearly died. Other times he was unnaturally wise for his age which contrasted badly with his immaturity. His character was rather inconsistent. Also, his training was really unrealistic. I KNOW he's a Dragonrider with super!speshul (Misspelling is intentional.) powers, but he learned to read, swordfight, and use magic in what, a few months, while Murtagh, the son of a turncoat Rider, trained for years to get that good. In fact, I liked Murtagh, Brom, Angela, Ajihad, and the supporting cast better than I liked Eragon and Arya. Arya was another annoying, stereotypical heroine. She spent most of the book in a coma while looking pretty and being in dangerous situations just so Eragon could save her, and when she woke up, she just got more descriptions of her legendary beauty, her fighting prowess, her ages-old wisdom, and her magical powers (Sounds Mary-Sueish. *gags*). I believe Paolini should have spent more time developing her personality rather than focusing on her looks and abilities. Her beauty and abilities do NOT endear her to me. Beautiful, female warriors can be sympathetic. A great example would be Eowyn from the Lord of the Rings. She is a beautiful warrior who got about the same amount of screen time as Arya. Tolkien made her likeable by showing us her strength, her unrequited love for Aragorn, and her vulnerability. Tolkien developed her so that when she defeated the Witch King we cheered, when she nearly died we cared, and when she finally found peace with Faramir we felt happy for her. Eowyn was human while Arya is an empty shell. I only hope Eragon and Arya are more developed in future books because if readers hate your two main characters, you are definitely in trouble.There is hope for the trilogy because I LOVE Saphira. I like her wry sense of humor and insightful wisdom. Her character was consistent, unlike Eragon who hovered between immature arrogance and unrealistic adult wisdom. I also saw a few imaginative ideas amidst the rampant unoriginality that I hope Paolini will develop in the future. Paolini's prose has ENORMOUS potential with a thorough editor. The reason I gave this book three stars was because this book got kids to read. Sure, it's nowhere near the quality of Harry Potter that got billions of kids to read and led me away from bad serials to great literature. Still if his book got kids to read, he must have something going for him. I will read Eldest with hope for better editing and more originality."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't know why everyone is so blind! Allow me to shed a little light. This is Star Wars with dragons!!!! Everytime someone mentions this book, I keep hoping they'll see the connection, but they don't. Any fan of that famous galaxy far, far away will be astounded by Christopher Paolini's lack of shame. He might want you think this is a homage to Star Wars, but I know what a homage is. When you change the names of characters and places, but keep the plotline and pretend its a different story, then its not a homage, its a rip-off!!In the story, the land of Alagaesia is ruled by a tyrannical Empire (an obvious theft), and the only hope is a band of rebels known as the Verdan (Rebellion), and the last remaining dragon rider (jedi knight). That hero happens to be a young boy living in a poor household, and whose adoptive parent eventually gets killed (oh, come on!!). He is taught to become a warrior by a retired rider named Brom (Obi-Wan Kenobi). There is also an elf maiden named Arya (Princess Leia), who gets kidnapped by the evil Durza (Darth Vader). I can go on and on.Still, it is entertaining to read because you are always curious as to how these books will sink with the movie (not the Eragon movie). Plus, it's hard for me to put a story down. I'll be happy when I read the third and final book because then I'll finally be able to toss the whole trilogy away."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's a watered-down version of Lord of the Rings repackaged with Dragonriders of Pern.

Both of which pivit the story of ERAGON. The first is a large blue saphire stone found by a young hunter who is sparring after game in a forboding area known as The Spine. The stone...is not a stone...Eragon discovers that it is an egg. An egg that hatches a saphire blue winged dragon who is later named Saphira.Upon their meeting the dragon immediately bonds with Eragon making their thoughts heard by each other. This creates an incredibly deep emotional seal between these main two roles. They feel each other's pain and joy. Together they must vanquish an empire ruled by the only other living dragon rider named King Galbatorix and a fiend of terrible power, a Shade.Eragon plots a direction to revenge his uncle and is joined by a man of mystery named Brom who will mean a great deal to him for he unveils much about Eragon and his startling abilities. His travels take him far and he faces many conflicts and his eventual entry into a secret city inhabited by Dwarves and humans who call themselves the Varden. Their society is tied together wtih an incredible breathtaking treasure.Which reminds me, I told you there were two saphires....The second is a boulder, a massive red star saphire wrought into a mystic rose marking the entrance into the ancient dragonhold. When saphire collides with saphire.... a true epic is born.The first five chapters did little to impress me though...especially when the term \\"sorcerer's stone\\" cropped up ... it wasn't until the Mythos of the dragon riders were revealed that I became enthralled in this book filled with questions and secrets.

(AND I am an adult)People have had a great deal to say about common themes in Paolini's work with the work of others (ie: tolkien, stars wars, H.P, C.S. Lewis...). People have also had a lot to say about the origins of many of j.k rowlings ideas as well as others... (Though, lets be clear, this is not tolkien and not even H.P. folks) It seems to me that you see similarities in stories -and many of these themes appear and reappear -for a very obvious reason. You will also find many of the same themes (in more simplified versions) in folk tales. They are out lined by joseph cambell clearly. It is called the hero's journey. And it is one of the oldest stories there is (Gilgamesh or book of job -bible). You will find many of the same elements in all kinds of books- they are just expanded differently. My point is, you don't need to assume he is \\"stealing\\" ideas. (any more than george lucas or even tolkien.) As for Earagon in particular...Are there times that you know this book is written by someone young? yes. Is it more simply written because of this? certainly. But it is still a good book. It is worth reading. And more than that -I look foward to reading Paolini's works as he matures as a writer. I think that we will see great things.enjoy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Perhaps I've read too many books in this genre but I found myself hating this book more and more as I read it.

This book, however, obviously takes elements from other books. Brom is like Obi-Wan, the mentor, Eragon, the farmboy, like Luke Skywalker, and Galbatorix like any cliche bad guy out there. The plot was nothing to write home about, as many times something would occur theat obviously had nothing to do with the overall story. One instance in which the plot confused me was when the pair of Brom and Eragon went on the chase of the Ra'zac. It never really dawned on me why they were intent on killing these unimportant foes. It was obviously implemented just to get Eragon into the rest of the story (the beggining was way to long!). Another thing I did not like was how you did not get deeply involved with the characters. None, in my opion, with the exception of Saphira, were particularly interesting. Eragon was boring (not heroic, even bratty at times), Brom I din't care about because it was obvious he was going to die,and King Galbatorix was a terrible bad guy, a figure that didn't seem too menacing, mainly because of the little description about him. What would Star Wars be without Vader, or LOTR without Sauron? What these stories would lose without their notorious bad guys, Eragon lacks. I would recommend it though, if you enjoy fantasy, especially for pre-teens. It is not great in any way, but on the other hand it isn't bad."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The best book I've read this year was a book called Eragon.The author's name is Christopher Paolini.

The way that the story progresses was abolutly wonderful. (I'll try not to give any of the story away so people can discover the wonders of the book for themselves).Eragon is a rich tale of a boy and dragon who must make the hardest decision that he will ever face, fight on the side of the Varden (good guys), fight with the Empire (bad side), or choose to fight on no side at all. Each choice will mean a diffrent outcome in the way that is being fought. The people that Eragon encounters on his epic quest are shroweded in mystery, leaving you wondering what the real truth is about them.After the first time that you start reading this excellent novel you will never be able to put it down. The story line will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending only leaves you wanting to dive right in to the sequal to this book, The Eldest, which I have been waiting to come out since I finished reading Eragon for the first time.

I disagree with all who say he copies. Anyone who attempts fantasy with elves and dragons is going to be accused at some point of copying Tolkein. In Eragon, Paolini pays homage to several fantasy writers, most prominently Anne McCaffrey, author of The Dragonriders of Pern series. I chalk all these negative reviews up to people who are jealous that they can't write like Paolini, and jealous of his immediate success.Eragon is a teenage boy living on his uncle's farm. He hunts, and enjoys spending time in the mountains. One day, he finds an odd blue object. When it proves impossible to sell, he keeps it. This strange blue object will lead him to his greatest friend and his greatest love. Unfortunately, it also leads to a terrible tragedy. Soon he is fleeing for his life.Eragon is assisted in his quest by the Gandalf-like Brom. Brom is one of my favorite characters. His wisdom is true and relevant. It is impressive that such wise ideas came from a young man like Paolini.The book has some violent as well as gruesome imagery. But as a true fantasy novel, you are drawn into another world, and eagerly follow Eragon's quest on the extensive map provided.I strongly disagree that this is a kids book.

I have to think that there was a lot of beginner's luck involved, or perhaps just good timing, with the current craze for fantasy. The book is good, but it's definitely not great. I had to read at least the first ten pages of this book before I could even decide whether or not I had wasted my money. Past that, it did improve, and it's reasonably good - perhaps exceptionally good, for the age of the author, but frankly I don't don't care how old the author is when I spend my money - I want a book worth reading. So, if you like fantasy, and you like the very, very familiar subjects of Riders, dragons, magic, kingdom maps, good vs. evil, etc., you will do fine with this book. If you've read much else in the way of fantasy, be prepared, though, for some pauses. About every two or three chapters, I found myself thinking, This sounds just like... or... No way, that's not believeable, or... That definitely sounds like a teenager wrote it. The Snowfire scene near the beginning bothered me so much I almost threw in the towel. The characters need horses, so they go to a livery stable, and find a gorgeous white stallion (trite, trite, trite) named Snowfire (such a creative name - and perhaps the son of Shadowfax?) Asked if the horse is for sale, the owner says no, he wants to sire a whole line of horses from this stud, but one sentence later, he says Okay and pockets the money. I happen to be an experienced horseperson, and I have a one-word description for that scenario - NOT."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Far as I know, Eldest hasn't been realized yet, but I;d like to thank the reviewer below me for spoiling the next book.

The story is about a young boy, named Eragon, who thinks his life has no significance with the world around him. But he discovers that he is very wrong. He finds a strange rock in a forest near where he lives. But he finds out it isn't a rock. It's an egg. And it's no ordinary egg. It's a dragon egg. The dragon hatches and chooses him as its rider. He had always heard stories about the dragon riders and how only one was left. The twisted king of the land. But now he has the power to fight him. He first starts out by pursuing the Ra'zac, who are might warriors that killed his uncle. He travels for months and then is bested by them in a battle and flees on his dragon who he has named Saphira. His companion Brom an age old rider whose dragon was killed in a battle long ago is killed by urguls. Urguls are mighty beasts that take at least 3 men to kill. But he escapes and goes to the dwarf city Tronjheim where a battle takes place soon after he arrives. He and Saphira get hurt but survive and find that they the dwarfs and humans managed to kill the army of urguls and drive them away from the city. \\"Saphira, I need you! He shouted, but the battle's tide had separated them. Suddenly an Urgul jumped at him, club raised for a blow.\\" This book was very well written and is intense.

It certainly has entertainment value and the storyline is not all bad, but there were simply too many stupid coincidences, nuances and bad grammar for it to be considered a great work of literature, no matter how much the author claims it is. Ironically, this book is targeted for readers of my age, which is 14. Maybe I am simply a more advanced, prolific reader than most 14-year olds. I doubt that, however, judging from other people's reviews. True, many adults are being overly critical and nit-picky about Eragon, but I believe kids and teenagers deserve books of the same caliber as adults do, not merely a rip-off of \\"grown up\\" literature.There are a couple of certain points of Eragon I feel the need to critisize, which are...The PlotlineThere is nothing to be said about Eragon's plot that hasn't been said before. Every once in a while, I saw lines that most certainly had been written by Mr. Paolini with the original manuscript(Lotr, Star Wars, etc etc) clutched right in his hand. In that, the book is actually quite entertaining in the way that it follows \\"classic fantasy elements,\\" only insert the quotations with \\"blatant plagarism.\\" What makes the book especially UNreadable is how unconsistent and repetetive it is (and the writing, but that'll come later..). I could forgive the author for imitating some parts of other books (because pitfalls are hard to avoid while writing fantasy)if the story was well-written or had a unique voice. Unfortunately, Eragon has none of these. I swear, I will scream if I hear one more line about Arya's sculpted lips and triangular eyebrows, or whatever it is. Eragon himself is contradictory. one minute he sounds like a whiny little farm bumpkin and before you know it, he's hewing Urguls with his majestic blade and spewing philosophical nonsense. And whenever Eragon has one of his \\"feelings if foreboding,\\" something bad always happens not so long afterwards. Talk about predictable.The Writing ItselfTo me, this is the worst part of Eragon. The author simply tries too hard. He uses words that probably came from the thesaurus he was holding there right in his hand(you know, once he finally put down Earthsea). The writing is flowery and over-descriptive. More than once, I found myself skipping over paragraphs, and even pages at a time. The characters are stupid, flat and contrived. Arya especially annoyed me. ENOUGH with the eyebrows, already, Chris! He tried to portray her as some kind of exotic warrior-maiden, an Arwen for the feminist generation. Well too bad. Even though she has a big sword, Arya is still nothing more than a love interest for the oh-so-manly protanagist. Publishers tried to market this book as being written by a kid, but Christopher Paolini is no longer a kid. At his age (22, 17 when Eragon got published) I should imagine his writing style to be much more refined. Oh well, I guess that's what comes out of homeschooling. I do admire his passion for writing, because that's a rare thing in most people today. With a lot of guidance and maybe some college education, he could turn out to be a promising author, but for now what he needs to do is go out into the world and actually LIVE a little."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a middle school librarian and learned of Eragon in September 2002 from an online e-mail Texas Teachers Listserve.

His presentation of 45 minutes held the attention of a multi-level group of students in the library for the entire time.

Second of all, perhaps that he was even dumber to name the title the same as his main character, which threw me off at once and probably a thousand others like me for the \\"coinsidence\\" of the names...Sure, Paolini tried, but he didn't try hard enough. He was obviously greatly enfluenced by Tolkien, and didn't do much to hide it. It's fine for authors to be inspired by other authors but what Paolini has done is copying. For example:The Ra'zac. They have a strong resemblence to the Nazgul in LotR, plus they're searching for something, as were the Nazgul.. Also the fact they have flying beasts for riding.THe Urgals are purely Orcs, except for the horns... Plus the Urgal's \\"heavy\\" assault guys...

The whole story was actually very boring and it dragged (well, I'm not sure about the whole story since I never finished because I couldn't stand turning another page of this book.)Also, I have to add something. Mr. Paolini spends an entire paragragh talking about a knot in the wood of the table, but we don't even know how Eragon looks like. Also, in this paragraph (I like ranting about this paragraph) it states that Eragon is looking for answers in this knot on the wood. I mean, why the heck is he looking for answers in the knot. And one more thing. He uses the words excruciating, and asymmetrical in that same paragraph.

He was simply inspired by them.\\" Not true. It's okay to have a plot like this: Village Boy finds strange Magic Artifact and recieves Hero's Sword and Magic Training from a Wise Old Mentor. Village Boy goes with his Faithful Companions to save the Beautiful Princess and destroy the Evil Enemy. HOWEVER, it's necessary to throw in SOMETHING original. Everything in this book, from the dragon riders to the magic system centered on the Old Language was identical to different series.Next, Fanney said that it was okay to have stereotypical elves, dwarves, and dragons because a human in the real world is not a cliche. Hey, Fanney, don't confuse the real world with a fictional one. Fiction is meant for entertainment and stereotypes hold it back from that purpose.Fanney says this is story has \\"moments of surprising depth\\", but these are just what Fanney says they are: moments. Sporadic, temporary moments that Paolini tacks onto the plotline and forgets about within the next few pages. He fails to use these themes in a way that makes the reader actually care about them. He just throws them into the mix in an attempt to sound mature and philosophical.Oh, and how does Paolini suddenly become immune to accusations of unoriginality simply because Tolkien and Rowling were accused of the same thing?One more thing. Fanney defends all these cliches but has the nerve to say \\"That is not to say that one should not strive for originality in story.\\" I should point out only negative reviewers of Eragon use concrete details in their reviews. Fanney, as well as all other Eragon fanatics, fails to point out one thing in this book that shows real creativity or originality. Why? Because they can't."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It amazes me how far publicity can take a book. As I scan through page upon page of raving reviews, I cannot help but notice that every other one seems to be written by a kid. This is not suprising considering a human under the age of 25 has not fully developed the skills to differentiate between good and bad. Also, all they seem to say is \\"This book rocks!\\" or \\"Man! It was awesome!\\" and my favorite \\"This is the best book ever!\\" How insolent! They don't even say WHY the book is good. Maybe it's because the don't know and they're just jumping on the band wagon. These people can go stick their faces into a pile of cow feces.Now, let me explain why you should not, under any circumstances, read this book. Something different than all the other one star review people who are raging about the copying in it. While this is true, I will focus on the issue from a more technical standpoint. First, the plot. Your general plot can be represented by a steadily rising line that has rougly three major peaks incorporated into its gradual ascent. This is the golden rule of writing succesful and fulfilling fiction. However, Eragon violates this principle. It does have its peaks, but the time in between them is mostly occupied by monotonous traveling. If people were that excited by traveling, airplane pilots and stewardesses could be best-selling authors. Near the end of the book, where the tension is supposed to be nearing its highest point, the story drops so low it almost falls off the graph. Eragon finds himself in a place with no immediate danger. This is truly a sign of amateur plotting.This is the fact that disturbs me most, though. I have read reviews where the reviewer reeled off his or her disbelief in the fact that the author, only fifteen when he started the book, could possibly have such an extensive vocabulary. Have you ever heard of a thesaruas? \\"Oh!\\" you say \\"Like in Jurassic Park!\\" No. It is obvious he never intended for you to actually look some of them up, in which case you would see that he used them incorrectly. I do not enjoy having my reading experience puctuated by constant trips to the dictionary. These words only detract from the reading experience as a whole. Do you see Stephen King going around using crazy words like that? No. It's because he's an experienced author who knows what he is doing.For the sake of humanity, do not buy this book.

Is anything going to happen yet?\\" Then something would happen and I'd think a climax thing is coming on, but it's not. And then all the characters were poorly discribed; they'd mention the character in chapter 5, he'd come up in chapter 17, and the author wouldn't remind you who the character is (ex: a brother, shopkeeper, good, bad??) I'd have to go back ten chapters just to figure out who so-and-so is. It annoyed me; I was trying to have fun reading and it became a job. I read half of it and stopped. I tried it, but decided to read something else that was \\"worth\\" my valuable reading hours.Quite frankly, the author may have been 15 when he began writing it, but that doesn't mean he's a good author. I read in one review that he only got a GED; I do know he was home-schooled, which doesn't really count as school, either. The boy can't write! I don't beleive he copied Tolkien and I do beleive the plot is origonal...it would have been much more likeable if it was written by Funke, McCaffery, Gregory MaGuire, or even Avi or Alice Hoffman. Anyway, his parents own a publishing company, and of course THEY'RE going to accept it to become hardback.An o.k. book, but may be a dissapointment to Lord of the Rings lovers. Sterotyped by the author's age. I'm sorry, but the boy needed more experiance before he leaped into the published world of literature."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Like many of the readers, I have heard the exaggerated hype of this book and curiosity killed the cat, because I decided to buy it. After struggling through the first couple of chapters, I managed to get a certain \\"flow\\". It was not that \\"Just one more page... just one more page..\\" flow, it was more likely that \\"come on, you can do it... finish this book!\\". After two months, I managed to finish it and frankly, this is was the most arduous task I ever had to do.It was not because I am a slow reader, it was because I had to put the book down and breath before I send it hurtling through the window.Often, when I have to read a book for school I do not like, I usually go on Sparknotes, but this... There was no Sparknotes around.First off, I will completely ignore the tangible fact that Paolini used every cliche plot known to the fantasy world and his obvious inspirations from the other fantasy books. Let's focus on the writing and the way in which he told the story. An ant crawling held my attention longer than this book did. Too much descriptions, and many times, they were seemingly inserted in random places that disrupted the flow of the story. I want to see the battle in my head, not see how many furs or whatever on an Urgal's body!The dialogue seemed force and unnatural. Paolini, I know you have been homeschooled, but honestly, did you ever have any regular interactions with the rest of the world? Sometimes they are so ridiculously corny, I had to laugh.And the characters. Oh boy. Eragon. That boy drove me crazy. Sometimes I hoped that Paolini wrote that one of the other characters stuck tape over Eragon's mouth. It is not a good idea to sell a book if people despises the main character.Another thing, Paolini's exaggeration of the elven beauty completely sickened me. Strangely, I have this vision where Paolini was once a fat little kid with thick glasses crying because no one played with him and he dreamed of having his own princess. I do not wish to bash him so harshly, but on his website, he seems so egoistical like he is the world's most brilliant writer. You cannot help but be ticked off.My review is long enough as it is and if you wish to know more about this horribly written book, there are other detailed reviews that can tell you more. For those who tell me that I should give him a break because he started writing a book when he was fifteen and somehow managed to get it published... well, I give him one star for that feat. I am writing a long fantasy novel, too. I understand how difficult it is.Maybe years and years of more school and experience can help Paolini write a better story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am nine years old and I fonud some things in this book that I did't like.

Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic, or is he a pouty teenager from the 21st century.When I got to the end I was so upset because I felt that there was so much that has been left unanswered. I felt that I was left hanging with some important issues, such as Eragons parents. It seemed to me that at the begining of the book he cared a great deal with wanting to know about his parents, especially his dad. But when it was discussed later on in the book Eragon never tried to find out any information. Especially when the character Brom talked about his mother and the fact that he knew her. Which led me to come up with my own speculation of...was Brom his father? Who knows because nothing was revealed."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Terrible piece of writing, a sign of the end times for good fantasy fiction - well, if you're a pessimist. If you're an optimist, than the book is a big, stinky publishing fart that will hopefully never repeat itself. Unfortunately, I see that the third is well on its way. I bothered to read the first two and let me say that that was more a sign of my sheer stubbornness than it was a sign that the book actually deserved reading. I literally had to sit myself down and refuse to get up until 50 pages were read to finish. I think it was morbid curiosity. What's got so many people actually spending money on it? I'd have to go with the formula for the story, as Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings with some Narnia and other stuff mixed in, for the why.Still, great working formula or not, the book just sucks in a fanfiction type way. I'm not saying fanfiction is necessarily bad, but it should never be formally published. Changing names and scenes doesn't count.

When a dragon hatches from the stone, a journey of magic, sorrow, and destiny begins for this young, unknowing boy. In the next few months, Eragon teaches Saphira, his new dragon, all the basics of survival, and even more as she grows. In time, he encounters a distressing incident that will force him to leave Carvahall with Saphira, and trek throughout the world of Alagaesia. Brom, generally renowned to be a storyteller of the history of Alagaesia, accompanies Eragon in his perilous quest for answers to why he was chosen to be one of the ancient and legendary Dragon Riders. Throughout the story, Brom acts as Eragon's mentor of magic, combat, and perception.Christopher Paolini has created a creative, surprising, and stimulating plot for Eragon. The different themes he puts into the story blends into episodes of both conflict and resolution.

One of the main characters is Eragon, a brave young boy with powers beyond his wildest dreams. Eragon is faced with many challenges, considering he is the last of the Dragon Riders. A Dragon Rider, obviously, would need a dragon and her name is Saphira. She is Eragon's best friend. Together they face dreaded Urgals; survive scorching deserts; and save a nation, known as the Varden. However, their ultimate goal is to overthrow the king of Alagasia who is making everybody miserable and rescue the last two dragon eggs known throughout the kingdom. Eragon is set in the fictional land of Alagaesia. Alagaesia is an empire with many rivers, plains, mountains, and deserts. There is a map of Alagasia in the front of the book. This story was so enjoyable because of its ongoing theme that you will always prevail if you stay true to your heart, your friends, and your dragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Young warrior saves elf-woman from evil monster.This plot has been done uncountable times,from ancient fables to Greek myths to the legends of King Arthur and beyond.We have it one more time in \\"Eragon\\" as the young man of the title goes on a quest with his magic dragon to rescue the kidnapped damsel.I can't relate to this type of fantasy,especially one that has over 400 pages of questing with a hurry-up obligatory battle tossed in at the end.This book strongly reminds me of \\"The Fairy Queen\\",a thousand page epic written by Edmund Spenser in 1596.By this date much of the fantasy figures we meet in \\"Eragon\\" are firmly in place--doughty knights rescuing women from an Ogre,an evil king,a sorcerer or enchantress.In doind so they battle with their minions--giants,reptile people,dragons,etc.The only new twist in \\"Eragon\\" is that Eragon's dragon,Saphira,is his ally.Spenser's book features several warriors going on multiple adventures.The warrior-saving-damsel plotline remains the same in all of them,except in one story the knight's sweetheart and an Amazon don armor to battle it out over the knight.The reason I mention Spenser's book is because \\"Eragon\\" is like one of his stories stretched out to over 400 pages.The young author,Christopher Paolini,can certainly chew up paper.I found Spenser's book of knights bashing evil creatures somewhat repetitive,but in Paolini's book I found Eragon's drawn out quest positively numbing.Despite what I say,one can't discard the resonance these stories have on people.Fantasy stories can have their feet firmly fixed in reality--Spenser's benevolent Fairy Queen was a thinly disguised Queen Elizabeth,who rewarded him with a hefty yearly pension.J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy has characters based directly on the comrades he knew in the trenches of World War I.These fantasy adventure tales can have roots in real human experiences,and they can be told over and over with a never dwindling enjoyment.If you like fantasy adventures,and can put up with the intricacy of Eragon's sometimes plodding quest,you may enjoy \\"Eragon.\\""},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really loved this book.

Besides, it never hurts to get outside of your comfort zone and see something new.At a high level, it seemed Eragon was heavily influenced by Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, but it lacked the crispness and depth of those books. Still, some of the characters were particularly interesting, such as the Shade and the Elf. The relationship between Eragon and Saphira was warm and Paolini did a good job of developing it through the novel.In principle, I think it is unfair for sympathy for an author to influence a review of their work, but let's face it: this was a solid effort by a very young writer. In those areas where the book would have benefitted if Christopher had written from a place of direct, hard life experience, he compensated in pure imagination. Yes, that makes if feel a little shallow in places, but it still is quite enjoyable. If you like this genre, I recommend you read this book.

This 500-page fantasy book was published in 2003. Eragon is set at least five hundred years ago. The main character, whose name is Eragon, is a farm boy. He has to go on an adventure with his dragon to try and save Alagaesia, the Empire. It all starts when he finds a blue stone but in reality it is a dragon's egg! Soon after the dragon hatches, a tragedy caused by evil occurs that will change his life forever. After that happens he is forced to go on an adventure with Brom (a storyteller) and when he is doing that he must make decisions that could change the Empire.The reason I like it, is because of the action packed adventure that Eragon had. The people and the animals were very well developed which made reading the story that much more interesting. Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, become more mature as the story unfolds. The author portrays the two main characters through telepathic conversations. Christopher Paolini describes the characters so that you can visualize them in your head. Through hardships they are forced to develop traits such as bravery, team work, responsibility and maturity. Also I think that the author did a wonderful job writing it, using great vocabulary as well as Old Norse for the magic words! Another thing, the author was only fifteen when he started to write Eragon. Which makes it even more amazing! I found Christopher Paolini made his book seem like reality even though it was fantasy. I understand Eragon when he has to make decisions about real life problems. Although this book was written for children it is a fabulous read for anyone!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first saw the book in the store I was a little hesitant to buy it. For one it was in the kid's section and I didn't know how big the print was, and two, I had never heard of Chistopher Paolini before. Well, I am definately glad that I decided to buy the book! This is a magical thriller with a twist of Lord of the Rings that anyone of any age will love! It invlves a poor farm boy named Eragon who finds a \\"stone\\" which eventually turns out to be a dragon's egg. From here on he is thrown into a world of adventure and peril as he races to find his uncle's killers (the Ra'zac).He discovers a world of Elves, dwarves, Urgals (something like Orcs), Shades (sorcerors), and the legendary Dragon Riders which he is now a part of!

This is the first book out of a 3-book trilogy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"... and on its head and feet and hands and legs and anywhere else it could find to put it. This isn't so much a story as a high school creative writing project by a fantasy-obsessed teen. Others have pointed out just how much Paolini has borrowed, so I won't rabbit on.Sadly, he doesn't let the readers think for themselves. The hero sees someone with pointed ears. \\"An elf!\\", he thinks. Well, duh! This happens all the time. The book could be significantly shortened if the author didn't need to explain the obvious through inner thoughts and diatribes by other characters. And too often, you think \\"I know what's going to happen\\" and it does. Because you know Paolini's influences and he has failed to rise above them. There's foreshadowing and there's standing there screaming \\"look, there's a clue, there's something that's going to happen, look there, look, look!!\\". Sadly, not much foreshadowing in this book.I did make it through, but saints preserve me from having to read any more of this.

The scenery is well described, the character development is well done. The mystery surrounding each character is beautifully revealed throughout the book. I could not wait to get home from work to get back to it each day. I love Saphira and can not wait for the second book to visit with my new favorite characters. I would not compare this book to any other. It is one in it's own and I look forward to more from this young author.I am in my fifties and would recommend this book for young and young at heart.

But when the traveling merchants come he shows one merchant the rock and the merchant says it's hollow but that's odd because rocks aren't hollow .The rock turns out to be very unique, you'll find out why. To find out more read the book. During the story Eragon goes from being normal to being heroic. The book is almost all adventure. The mood of the story is an eerie mood. A nineteen-year-old boy called Christopher Palino wrote the book. This is his first book. The style of his writing is mature and he describes things well through out the whole book. This book's setting is in an imaginary world. This book is the first in a trilogy and I really want to get the next book when it comes out. People that like books with adventure would love this book or people who love dragons, action, or magic.

I think the best praise I can give to it is that the world seems to have been created first and the story almost an after thought, because jsuta few chapters in and you find yourself almost another citizen.

Instead of thinking 20 seconds longer and finding the perfect verb or noun, he took the lazy way out and just hung lots of adverbs and adjectives on his words. Bleah.

Paolini graduated high school when he was 15 and started work on a novel. When he was 17, \\"Eragon\\" was published by Knopf and the book landed at the top of bestsellers lists across the country. This would be a good first novel for anyone, but as this is the debut novel from a teenager, I think we have just been put on notice that a major new talent has arrived. This was quite a good novel, and Paolini will only get better as he ages and refines his craft.This is, at its core, a simple and fairly typical fantasy story. A fifteen year old boy lives in an isolated village in the mountains. One day while exploring he comes across a blue gem. Selling this gem will help get enough money for his family to have enough to eat for some time, but nobody knows quite what it is worth and the regular traders do not want to fleece young Eragon. The stone turns out to not be a gem, but rather an egg, a dragon egg to be exact. When the dragon is born, Eragon decides to raise it, and learns that dragons are very intelligent and powerful creatures. There were once Dragon Riders in the land, but the evil King Galbatroix, a former Rider himself and with the help of rogue Riders, hunted down the Riders and slaughtered them. Now there are no Riders left. Galbatroix knows that the egg is out there and he is sending his forces out to reclaim the egg/ and the new Rider, Eragon.\\"Eragon\\" is reminiscent of the fantasy of Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey, Terry Brooks, and several other fantasy authors. It is similar, but Paolini tells his story well enough, and makes it interesting enough, that it doesn't really matter. Paolini was able to hold my interest well enough that I am looking forward to the second book in the \\"Inheritance\\" trilogy and I am glad that I finally got around to giving \\"Eragon\\" a try. It was a fun book to read, and was rather fast paced.

So, I ordered Christopher Paolini's Eragon.Having watched the deterioration of the English language over the last 30 years, I certainly didn't expect to find what I found in this delicious, huge, and handsome book. In my twenties, I stayed up for two days reading The Lord of the Rings. In my late fifties, I found myself doing the same with Eragon...not once, but twice!Eragon is articulate, engaging, and immediately involves the reader in really caring about the main characters, Eragon and Saphira the blue dragon. Some of the imagery is hauntingly beautiful, the story is face-paced enough to keep the pages turning long into the night, and, best of all, it leaves you hungering for more.I am astounded that a story this captivating was conceived of and brought to fruition by a young man in his teens. Just the focus alone required to complete a work of this magnitude would daunt some of the staunchest writers. I can only say to Christopher, \\"Bang on that keyboard my boy!

That's a life changing book! in this day and age where increasing numbers of children know how to read, but choose not to, I applaud any author who can motivate children to read. I have mad love for a simpler style of writing that invites young readers to take on a new and exciting genre."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's amazing to me the many times I read in reviews about how similar one story is to the next and this was taken from that. These similarities may or may not be coincidence or intended.. does it matter? The heart of the issue is how well the Author, in mention, conveyed his own story. T.S. Eliot, himself, said, \\"Good writers borrow. Great writers steal.\\" However, if I have to explain the merits of this quote in relation to what I am sharing with you, it would be lost on you anyway. To those, these words are not lost on; let us continue . . . Eragon, in my opinion, was well done. No, it didn't reach the heights of Shakespeare, but for what it is, it accomplished what I think the writer set out to do: write a fantasy novel that could capture the minds of its readers. To me, the mark of a good book is one that can enrapture me. When I can see the story clearly in mind, and the pages become a world in which I can escape; where the characters are well developed and identifiable to its readers. Eragon was a wonderful book to read in this aspect. I am excited to find such Authors like Christopher Paolini, and am truly excited to see how he develops into an even better writer as his story continues to develop in the Inheritance series and after."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"yes, yes i have.this book's beautiful and unique art direction conceals its utter predictability and poor writing.not only are all of the author's ideas borrowed, the story is extremely frustrating, featuring a - you guessed it - coming of age story of a precocious, hot-headed boy whose guardian is killed. ARGH! it's like harry potter without the literary magic.the protagonist is frequently described as intelligent by the other characters, but he is an idiot. his pet dragon is smarter than he is, and she is six months old.the book's descriptions are mundane and unmoving. his mentor is Gandalf - complete with pipe, smoke circles, and magic. the main character's motivation is shallow, and the book is peppered with weird existential musings that sharply contrast with his overall optimism. for example, \\"look at that pretty brook. it wouldn't care if i lived or died.\\" WHAT?!lastly, whenever the author can't decide how to end a scene, he ambushes the protagonist, overwhelming him despite his house-sized dragon and apparent martial prowess, and knocks him out. literally, the kid has fainted or been concussed more times than i can count. fantasy or no, he should be brain-damaged.i understand, readers, that you like fantasy. me too, i'm a big fantasy nerd. but really, don't waste time or money. it's not worth it. read something - anything - else."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a story that you will read every spare moment until you're done with the book. Christopher Paolini (can you believe this kid is only eighteen!) has written a story that will last the test of time because it has all the classic elements: an event at the beginning that starts a series of situations and adventures, love, a coming of age story, an inheritance, bad guys (Urgals) and good guys, not the least of which is a brilliant blue dragon, Saphira. I really don't want to give away much, because you just have to read this book for yourself too see what I mean.I loved this book. I think this author has hit a home run. I am still chasing the ball and loving the journey. I finished the book two weeks ago, yet the &quot;world&quot; that Paolini has created in Eragon still sticks with me. I can see it in my mind's eye. I find myself wondering about the characters, and when the next book will be ready."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I can't believe that people would rate this book so low! It's hands down the best book I've ever read; I like Eragon even more than Harry Potter! This book was incredible as soon as I started it. It was filled with rich details and a great character development. I just can't get enough! Bravo Cristopher Paoloni, for your wonderful use of fantasy, and I hope that people would consider buying Eragon for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Now, I don't really like fantasy novels. They're all too clich&eacute; and obviously inspired/plagarized from Tolkein. I don't really like Tolkein, either, but his style is very easily spotted in a book.I picked up Eragon because I heard that he wrote it between the ages of 15 and 19, and knowing a teenager like me got something published must have meant it was actually good. And then I got through it. And then I came to this site to see if I was truly alone in my dislike. Hey, whaddya know, I'm not!This book was a little like Super Bubble brand gum, the kind you get in your Halloween candy bucket. It's super-sweet for the first 30 seconds, but immediately aftwerwards, it loses all traces of pleasant flavor. The first chapter was okay, a little sickening but okay, and then it all went downhill from here.(Especially with the introduction of that elven girl. I keep wanting to call her Arwen, but that's not right. The name was really like Arwen but it wasn't...anyway, moving right along...)It seemed like a 3-year-old's retelling of Lord of the Rings. You know how they always describe in detail the unneeded parts, and then just kind of roughly go over the main points? And when a 3-year-old tells a story he made up, he usually takes a lot of it from some other story he heard. That's pretty much what Chris did. Except he's not 3, and he took most of it from Lord of the Rings. I know everyone else has said this but I can't emphasize it enough.Although, I will be nice in the fact that almost every fantasy novel has the same formula. Average person runs into something that will change his destiny forever, he's like \\"I don't wanna be a hero\\" and then he has to because the fate of the universe rests on his shoulders. Yadda yadda yadda.Pampered kid with publisher parents - check. Huge ego - check. Young age - check. Writes a very unedited novel - check. Clich&eacute;, predictable - check. Huge media attention factor - check.It's the entire recipe of a mainstream fantasy in one pretty darn painful volume. To make matters more brain hurting, there's going to be three of them. Oh, the humanity."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I won't bother rehashing old arguments. Eragon is derivative and there's nothing that can be done about that. I understand that fantasy usually is derivative. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are also derivative of other sources. But what makes Eragon's derivativeness worse than that of Star Wars and LOTR? This book is dry. In SW and LOTR, there are interesting characters and action to mask the derivative elements. But Paolini says \\"characters are born out of necessity\\". The story has no soul; it has a plot but nothing else. That's why the cliches are more obvious in Eragon than in others books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hmm well i have been reading through the other reviews posted by fellow fiction readers. Hve you noticed that all the reviews entitled 'kids review' have 5 star and similar comments? Perhaps they have not read Lord Of The Rings? Maybe not seen Star Wars. Or perhaps they are just yound and impressionable, but either way this book was a complete waste of my time. Which I could have spent reading something decent, perhaps His Dark Materials Trilogy. I only read this book to the end because my friend, who had read and enjoyed the book, pressed me too. Hoping the book would get better i finished it, up until the last page I found my eyes rolling into the back of my head, the book literaly sent me to sleep.Take my advice Mr Paolini, give up. Go to college get a job, and forget all about this bad, bad time in your life!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While being 15 I expect to see people of this age group to write like this instead of wrtng liek dis lol lol. When I was 15 I was writing my own fiction that was truly non-borrowed (I'm thinking the other reviewers thing 15 is YOUNG when it is NOT.) Thus, this book is utter plagarism! From when the house gets ruined to the Obi-wan Kenobi Brom, it's all there. I knew even before it was written, who Brom was. He was the Jedi master that had a dragon whose name was Saphira, yadda yadda. Thus knowing this I know who Eragon's father is and that he might have a sister, etc. If I was George Lucas, I would sue. There's too much the same here for it NOT to be different.Also, Paolini can't seem to do a decent scene change without having the main character black out! This is POOR choreography and could have been written better. Overall the structure of the time and the pacing reads like a fanfiction I see for Harry Potter or Sailor Moon.As for all the people who give it props for no reason, go out and READ more WATCH movies more. You'll see that others have gone before. I'm honestly NOT enthralled in the book, it's like a train wreck though, you want to keep reading just tosee how much this guy DID rip off from the others."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Fantasy is a difficult genre to work with because, at this point, nothing can really be spectacularly original anymore. However, fantasy writers can still be successful is they are skilled in either prose or storytelling. And there lies the problem with this book.Paolini, gifted though he might be, has not developped a great writing style or a gusto for plot. What makes writers like J.K. Rowling or Cornelia Funke so distinguished as fantasy writers is that they are able to take convention and make the most of them. Paolini, however, writes with a plodding hand that reminds of a bad high school short story and his plot seems like it's been taped together from a collection of other work.If you're not familiar with fantasy, then go ahead and read it. If you are, you're not missing much."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just can't understand why people rate this book 2 or 1 stars. Some people say that the characters show no emotion. This, however, is not true. The characters show sorrow, anger, happiness, and affection. All the characters are unique and different from those in other books. One guy rated it only one star, but said he didn't even finish the third capter! I agree that it gets off to a slow start, but so do Harry Potter and C. S. Lewis books. My favorite part is when Eragon defeats the shade. All in all Eragon was a very good book, and Christopher Paolini was only 15 when he wrote it!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini is a very good writer. At the same time I was reading a Jackie Collins book, - compared to him, she is indeed a novice with obvious grammetical mistakes and infantile usage of words. Though she must be his great-grandmother's age, she writes like a 9 year old. Well Anyways coming back to Paolini - his greatness can be gauged by the fact that though I hate fantasy stuff, his prose make the charaters appear real - this is indeed a markmanship of an excellent writer and hopefully he continues to do the same!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's nice to have a nice big fantasy to immerse oneself in. Paolini has certainly provided that. I'm impressed with the scope of his work, even if it is somewhat derivitave (isn't _all_ fantasy derivative?). He could have worked harder on the dwarves (nordic mining midgets who wear armor at all times) and elves (ultrapowerful immortal warrior-mages from across the sea), certainly. But I thought the dragon-riders were an interesting idea: they ride dragons AND are really strong AND awesome fighters AND know magic, allowing Eragon--with his budding but inevitable relationship with the incomparably lovely elf-woman Aria--to achieve the peak of adolescent male wish-fulfillment.There were some problems that kept jolting me out of the book. Paolini apparently has no concept of how to use a bow, since Eragon seems capable of stringing and unstringing it under any circumstances, even with his legs strapped into the saddle of a flying dragon. He also doesn't seem to have any idea what mountains are like, since the dwarven city-mountain of Tronjheim, merely one mile tall and made of solid marble, is dwarfed (if you'll pardon the expression) by the mountains around it, all of which are taller than Everest. He hasn't pondered the ramifications of magic using the wielder's energy \\"just like he'd done the work\\", since it's pretty clear that Eragon uses it to do a great deal more, and could have much greater effect with tiny amounts of energy in combat, say, by suffocation or by pinching an artery. It bothers me that Saphira is so wise at such a young age, but I guess she heard a lot from inside her egg. But these problems only mar the story, they don't ruin it.The writing is uneven. The plot is largely predictable, but not unenjoyably so. Paolini doesn't seem to really know what chapters are for, or where they should begin or end. His vocabulary is impressive, and mostly used to good effect.My biggest complaint actually isn't Paolini's fault. Because Saphira is a big strong dragon, Gerard Doyle reads her dialogue as a deep rumble. But it's a _mental_ voice; there's no reason for it to be rough and rumbly. Something smooth and elegant would have been more in her character.Eragon is overall a good kid, and makes an admirable (if somewhat dense) hero. Hopefully he and Paolini will grow into the next volume (_Eldest_, due August 2005) together."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a great fan of Science Fantasy. This book delivers in such a charming way that I passed it on to my two daughters, aged 13 and 20, who also have enjoyed the book. This author has a long career ahead of him. Any child who even thinks of writing should read Eragon. This book is getting a lot of Word of Mouth advertising in my area. Adults and children are finding it and passing it on to others. This is a must read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini is a talented and promising rising star. This book is a fun, rollicking ride through a world of dragons and evil creatures. Wizards and sages and monsters, oh my! It is enfuriating to some of us that a 15-18 year old \\"kid\\" could be this talented. Would that I could write this kind of story. The reader capable of-as Tolkien describes it-\\"a willing suspension of disbelief\\" will be catapulted into an alternate reality where magic abounds, where dragons breathe fire and where youthful heroes can defeat great and powerful evil. Derivative? Of course it is. All modern fantasy is derivative of Tolkien. Weis and Hickman write of dragons, halflings, dwarves, and wizards...gee, I wonder where they got those from. But, guess what kiddies, Tolkien was derivative. He even discussed the sources for his work. True, his sources were much older, but they existed. He ascribed his books to an attempt to build an Elder Edda of sorts for the British isles. The point being, that the source of an author's ideas is not important, it is the talent he has to spin a yarn that captures the imagination of the reader. He must be able to so engage the reader that he/she is carried away to the world the author has constructed and becomes a willing participant in the story. Young Christopher has done this with a rare talent. I am not a critic by profession, I don't particularly care how original a story is or how technically well it is crafted, I only care if I enjoy reading it and if it takes me out of my humdrum existence for a few hours. I have read a lot of fantasy in my 51 years, some good, some great, and some pretty mediocre. Mr. Paolini's work is of the top tier, and I look forward with great anticipation to his subsequent books. Well Done, Christopher!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have no real words to describe the wonderful book, that is Eragon. Paolini blends the content in the book together so skillfully, I found no part boring. I read the couple hundred page book in a day, without stopping. I simply can not wait until the next book comes out. I recommend this book to anyone who is desperate to read a well written book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a poor farm boy, one year away from his manhood celebration. One day, while hunting in the forest, there is an enormous explosion! In the very center of the blast radius, Eragon finds a polished blue stone. His first thought is that maybe he could sell it to buy food for his family. The butcher, Sloan, refuses to buy the stone when he learns of how Eragon found it. With the stone apparently useless, the blacksmith, Horst, buys food and gives it to Eragon. In exchange, Eragon must work as his assistant through the summer. Buoyed by his good luck, Eragon heads home with mixed emotions.One night, weeks after he found it, Eragon awakes to find the stone shaking and squeaking. Eventually, cracks began to appear down its sides. Then it split open entirely and out of the mess skittered a dragon! It was the end of Eragon's simple life as a poor farm boy.With only an ancient sword and an old storyteller for guidance, Eragon and his dragon fledgling must take up the role of the legendary Dragon Riders. He sets out to avenge his uncle's death and fight the evil king Galbatorix. But, whom should he hide with when his task is done? He cannot fight Galbatorix alone, and siding with him would be insane. Should he join the mysterious Varden and fight the rest of his life? Or perhaps the peaceful country of Surda? Both paths do not look promising, but where else can Eragon go?I would recommend \\"Eragon\\" to people 10 and older. It has a few language issues and can be gory at times. However, the style of writing is very easy to understand and the book is full of excitement to keep even young readers on their toes. The characters and geography are incredibly realistic and well developed. I also enjoy the fact the Eragon isn't more powerful than everything he meets like some of the characters in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" He isn't the perfect hero either which makes the book more realistic. Although the book is full of magic and adventure, you can almost believe that what's going on is really happening. AS the story goes along, Eragon gets stronger, makes mistakes and learns the truth about the legendary Dragon Riders. The story is full of incredible twists and turns, some of which you could expect, and others that would blow your mind. Eragon is faced with many hard choices, only one of which is safe.I give \\"Eragon\\" by: Christopher Paolini 5 Stars"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was difficult to put down! It's a wonderfully written fantasy with a touch of mystery that adopts the familiar ideas of dragons, dwarves, elves and a young boy, and combines them in such a believable manner that you can almost feel as if you are part of the story as Eragon and Saphira endure both grief and victory. You laugh with them, you cry with them, and at the same time trying to unveil the true identities of several key characters leaves you hungering for the next chapter, and of course, for the next book!

Although the story was original, I definitely picked up on the influence of Tolkein and Ursula K. Le Guin. However, I've found that books that are important to me influence the way I think and the way I write. One learns to write partly through reading both good and bad books, and it seems to me that Paolini learned well from the master storytellers that have clearly influenced his work.

I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book on a whim.

While I haven't read some of the big fantasy series-- Jordan, for example-- even I could see how Paolini took from several series. The most noticeable to me were Anne McCaffrey's Pern series and of course LOTR. But since LOTR is the \\"grand-daddy\\" of fantasy, I can forgive Paolini some of that. But his similarities to others are really too much.As for his writing-- the boy needs to take classes. His dialogue is terrible, and his descriptions are often trite and wooden. He definitely has talent, but it needs to be refined and honed. All good writers study their craft, take classes, etc. to improve themselves. As a writing major in college, I know this, and to see someone with so much talent not being allowed to reach his full potential really saddens me. Paolini is young, so he needs help, and therefore his editor should have done a better job. Kids deserve excellent writing, just like adults do.I'm in grad school studying to be a children's/young adult librarian and while I can understand kids wanting to read this book, it is not the first I would put in their hands. Sure, it gets them to read, but why not give them Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series or books by Jane Yolen or any other of a slew of excellent fantasy writers that are just as readable but whose books are far better?I strongly suggest to any teen readers to seek out better fantasy. Start with classics like Anne McCaffrey and then go on from there. Hopefully then you'll be able to see what good writing looks like."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Considering his age when he began this book, it is well written. It is entertaining, and kept me interested for the most part. There were parts that did ultimitly bore me, but overall, I enjoyed it.I noticed, like others have, some of the characters are very shallow, I he spends to much time introducing to many new characters, that the reader gets lost trying to decipher each one's personality, and in the end, this leads them to be somewhat 1-dimensional.There are exceptions to this of course, but it seemed like a prominent problem throughout the book.The other thing that dissapointed me was his basic photocopy of many of his ideas from Tolkien's Ring Trilogy, and McCaffrey's Pern books, but I attribute that to his young age. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and would recommend it, but do not expect to be dazzaled by a brilliant fresh new writer. Remeber, he was young, and was still searching for his voice. He can only get better with time ... or so we hope."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a exceptionally good book. It is plot-driven and it's creativity matches that of the famous J.R.R. Tolkein's. It begins with Eragon, the main character, hunting in the Spine where he finds a sapphire colored stone. Thinking it only something to sell for food, he is amazed when it hatches into a baby dragon. This is beginning of Eragon's story about adventure, courage, and honor. Eragon's ultimate goal is to defeat the evil King Galbotorix, which I'm sure he does in the other books, but in this book he tries mostly to defeat Durza the Shade. In his travels through Alagaesia, Eragon faces many barriers, some being killing urgals and mastering both the sword, and magic. Eventually Eragon finds himself at Farthen Dur, the hideout of the rebellious Varden. The style is fantasy rich with details and overflowing with creativity. The author, Christopher Paolini, creates words to fit his needs, which I think is kind of cool. I would recommend this book to any one who likes fantasy a lot. May your swords stay sharp!Just a note. I did this review for a school project. If it sounds corny, don't criticise."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Pro: It gets steadily better and more exciting towards the end. For a teenager, this is amazing (...)Con:The writing is sometimes clunky, dragons are too perfect-not in personality, but the author keeps on saying that dragons are mysterious and stuff so that when they do totally amazing things like create diamonds out of nowhere he can just use that as an excuse, Eragon has too many powers-a lot of the time the authors states something along the lines of 'wow, what you did in X days normally takes a person X months/years', the characters are unlikeable, and most importantly, it's excruciatingly unorginal.(...) The twists aren't surprising at all for someone who reads enough books-not just fantasy-to know all of the cliches. And it irks me that they don't even bother to make Eragon just born powerful, he's special because he is named after this really powerful guy (obvious, much?) and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a prophecy about his birth too. -.-Still, for a teenager it's good and toward the end it's exciting enough for me to want to read the next book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"great book, will check online everyday to try to find a date or somthing relating to the release of the second book. im going to tell friends and family to read this book. it may look long but you will think it was nothing the way it flows and you wont want to put it down after a few pages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book deserves a solid 5 stars!

The great thing about the book is that it provides an introduction to the genre for children (who the book was written for!)which doesn't go over their heads (like LOTR might).Eragon also combines the basic fantasy elements of many different books. If young readers want more,more, more of the same kind of books, Eragon is a great lead in to reading Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, His Dark Mysteries, etc.I recommend this book to parents/relatives seeking something engaging for their young ones.

There is also a dwarf, Orrik, an elf named Ayra and Brom.This story takes place in a fantastic land named Alegaseia. As Brom and Eragon trek to the peacemakers, named the Varden, they run into brutal obstacles.I advise you to read Eragon because of how it pulls you into the land of dragons and dragon riders. One way the author pulled me in was when there was the burst of light keeping Eragon from a deer. I couldn't guess what would happen next. I strongly encourage you to read this book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"a friend of mine leant it to me. Based on some of the reviews from the other adults on this site I was hesitant to read it. However, I thought it was very well done and a great read and I'm 40+. Can there be comparisons to LOTR? Yes, most definitely. But then again, if you look at any fantasy book you can find comparisons to LOTR. Sure there are elves and dwarfs, but Stephen King even has Elves and Dwarfs in his book \\"Talisman\\", but I don't hear people comparing that to LOTR and there are no dragon riders in LOTR, that I can recall.Anyway, if you're like I was and are sitting on the fence about reading this book take the leap and give it a try.

Also most of the ideas of the elves, dwarves and the special languages are all taken from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series.Also every time something big happens Eragon faints, which is very annoying.Even though the story is very unoriginal and annoying the plot was sometimes very interesting though a little predictable."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Before I even started to read this book, I was on the edge of my seat!

It is not going to be a literary classic in the sense that it will one day be a great piece of literature to be taught and studied, but it is certainly able to hold its own with the science fiction and fantasy world today. I was randomly in a book shop when I found this book on the counter and for some reason, was compelled to buy the nice hardcover though I had NO idea what it was about. Having read it, it follows the quest path of and introduces new characters above what one sees in the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. It also has a Star Wars resemblance in that Eragon is the new generation of an extinct order of extremely capable peacekeepers. For anyone who loves dragons, elves, and a very well written battle which has you on the edge of your seat, this is the book to sit down and enjoy. The author is able to keep you going through the story with the sign of most good books: that you don't separate the you in the chair from the you viewing the action. It is a challenging read too for those of you who are tired of being fed everything in a book. While many novels reintroduce the tid bits that are going to mean something, you can go a few hundred pages without being reintroduced to a part of the story that it turns out, was more significant later. I just finished the first book and I am still tingling with anticipation of starting the next."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is about a boy named Eragon.One Day when Eragon was hunting, a blue stone appears with a flash of light. Over time he finds that it is a dragon egg, even though dragons were thought to be extinct. The dragon hatches, and Eragon names her Saphira. One day two hooded strangers come into the town. They are looking for a blue stone. They find that Eragon has a blue stone and the strangers start coming after Eragon.Eragon flees into the spine to hide from the strangers, when he returns; he finds his house burnt down and uncle dead.Eragon flees the town to hunt down the strangers. A man named Brom comes with him.Brom has figured out that Eragon has a dragon because of all the information Eragon has wanted on Dragon lately. Brom tells Eragon that the strangers are called the Ra'zac.On their journey, Brom tells Eragon about the Dragon Riders, who were a group of people that rode on dragons and could use magic. The Riders kept order throughout the empire over 200 years ago, until they were exterminated by a man named Galbatorix.When Eragon and Brom get to Teirm, a major shipping city, they find that the Ra'zac have been seen around a city called Dras-Leona.Eragon and Brom arrive in Dras-Leona and are ambushed by the Ra'zac. They end up escaping but Brom is injured. Before Brom died he tells Eragon the location of the Varden, a group of people that oppose the empire. So Eragon decides to find the Varden and ask for needed help.I won't ruin the ending of the book, but it has a really great ending.

Christopher Paolini's structure of writing keeps you turning the pages one after the other. The book is slow in the begining; I would say the first 75 pages are sow, but once the true plot takes off the book is an action packed adventure. Mr.Paolini's book caught my interest and I can't wait until the second book,Eldest, is released in August.Eragon is a poor farm boy who finds a stone in the Spine where he is hunting. After trying to sell the stone in his village for food with no luck, he sets the stone aside to try to sell it to one of the Travelers with no success. But something unusual happens. The object that Eragon thought was a stone is actually a dragon's egg; which hatches in front of Eragons eyes. That's when the adventure begins. Eragon befriends Brom, a story teller, who helps Eragon on his journey. They travel or many montha with Saphira, the dragon, and encounter many interesting town folk, ruthless creatures, and heroic battles.Although this book is geared toward a teenage reader, I would recomend Eragon to anyone who loves novels about dragons and medieval times. The action scenes tend to get somewhat descriptive, so if the reader is young, or if the reader doesn't like to read about death, I would recomend reading the Harry Potter novels instead. But if you like an action packed, page-turning novel, Eragon is the book to purchase (or borrow)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I truely have fall for this book, I thought that someone as young as Christopher Paolini could not write such a good book.

If you love suprising books that keep you wondering what will happen next, I would highly recommened this book. There are lots of words in the ancient language to remember and pronunciation is a difficult thing sometimes too, but just use the the guides in the back of the book.

Young Eragon sets out on a quest to avenge his uncles death with his dragon Saphira and his Teacher Brom. He later travels to the Varden to help them deafeat the evil king. This fantasy takes place in a mythical land during the middle ages. It is a very exciting book with lots of fighting and conflict between the two sides. Based on this Book I expect the sequel Eldest to be excellent. Christopher Paolini did a excellent job on this book especially for a 17 year old writer trying to please kids just younger then him. The advetures of Eragon and his companions are compelling, you won't be able to put this book down until you are done. Eragon will leave you itching to read Eldest; these are 544 pages that you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"A sequel had to follow because this book ended before the story was over.Therefore the sequel \\"Eldest\\" where the action continues.

But it's worth reading just the same. Why? Those battle scenes are pretty freakin' cool, and as far as Obi-Wan Kenobi ripoffs go, Brom's easily the best of the bunch. Still, book 2 is infinitely better, since Panoli was a few years older and got a chance to grow as a writer. I'm not sure why this was published while he was so young, though - I mean, I'm a young writer myself and wouldn't exactly have the stuff I wrote four years ago published (for the uninitiated, he wrote this at 15, and it was published when he was 19). Another little quibble I have: if Eragon's a poor, illiterate farmboy, how the hell is his vocabulary so advanced? And really, why all the fantasy cliches?You get a mix between the good and the bad with Eragon. All in all, it'll do, but it ain't exactly Harry Potter you're reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really liked this book because of the dragon, Saphira and how the boy, Earagon doesn't really want it at first but after a while he and Saphira become really close as they have many adventures.

Saphira takes Eragon on a life time adventure that teaches him that you need to face your fears. Don't read this book if you don't like dragons or magic. When you read this book you might see a movie like picture in your head. Eventhough Eragon is long the suspence makes you want to read more. Bravo for Christopher Paolini."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Too start off, I want to make one thing clear: This book is heavily, heavily Lord of the Rings influenced. I know that most fantasy books are, but it's amazing how much deja vu you get here, conjuring up memories of reading the LotR trilogy.The only reason why I gave it two stars, is because it was written by a 17 year old. I cut him some slack, but honestly, we have nothing new.We have the old mysterious man, who helps the young protagonist out, and then tragically dies.We have the classic farmboy who realizes he will achieve greatness.We have the animal companion.We have the evil villain, who is actually just a henchman, but is dazzlingly powerful ( and not to mention it is hard to kill him ).The Elves are hot and are wise.The Dwarves are short, live in the mountains, and love war and beer.The goblins ( called something that just screams \\"Uruk-hai\\" ) are brutal.The towns and people are named strangely, and are occasionally unable to be pronounced.The only thing that was truly original was the the story behind the Dragon Riders, and the dragons themselves. That was the one part of the book that was truly a joy to read. Maybe if he pulled out a \\"Silmarillion\\" I might continue further in the Inheritance Saga.

They stone that he had found was rattling on the shelf where he had placed it. All of a sudden the stone started to crack, and then a little tiny dragon's head popped out.

The storyline is pretty standard for fantasy fare: a boy grows up in a remote farming community not knowing his parents and being taken care of by a distant family member. Then, a series of events lead him to discover his special powers and abilities. He struggles with these things and his implied destiny. Then, after getting attached to an old story teller, he accepts who he has become and goes on to begin fulfilling his destiny. Along the way he meets several other characters who are either important to this volume's story or will likely become more important as the series progresses. Of course, there is a climactic battle that brings him to the brink of death but in which he gains much reputation and renown setting the stage for volume 2.This is pretty pedestrian stuff, and if that was all there was to the series, there would be nothing much to get excited about. Nonetheless there is a great deal of excitement about this book as well as about volume 2 (Eldest) which was just released this year. What is the cause of that excitement? This substory is also worth telling.The author of these books is a young adult. He lives in the west and was home schooled. He decided to write these books because he has enjoyed reading fantasy his whole life and wanted to write something himself. He started writing Eragon at the age of 15. The first book was self-published by his family and only later picked up by Knopf. The second book is now released when the author has achieved the ripe old age of 21!It is possible to see the development of the writer as one reads through this book. In the beginning the sentences are very short and choppy and read in a staccato manner; something like: \\"He looked to the left. He saw a rock. He took the rock.\\" Etc. By the end of the book, the same kind of sequence is much more polished. The sentences are significantly longer and the descriptions are fuller. The development of the characters also change as the book goes along. His uncle and some of the townfolk where Eragon grows up are almost cartoonish in their descriptions. The folk met with at the end of the book are much more fully described both in their physical characteristics and their emotional reactions. It is one of the enjoyments of the book to go along with the writer and see his development and growth.If for no other reason than to see this development, it is worth getting and reading this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was not particularly THE BEST, but I found it rather enjoyable after looking through the slight predictability and grammarical flaws.

Just a few things didn't make sense along the way, however, and I will join the countless ranks of people who have flatly pointed them out. First of all, the quality of the writing style was extremely erratic. The verbiage would be wonderful one moment, then it would plummet the next.At the beginning of the book, here we are in this really suspenseful sequence of waiting for the Urgals to attack the Elf company, and Paolini goes into a full discription of the elves' weaponry, armor, clothing, etc. Throughout the book, all of the good sequences are buried under mountains of unwanted adjectives. It also really bothered me when the author used paradoxical adjective pairs (i.e. ...instead it was LUCID and CLEAR). When you come across something like that, you can just tell that the guy was using a thesaurus.When the Ra'zac are attacked at Eragon's camp, the description of the attack makes it seem like there are roughly twenty archers, but two pages later we find out that it was just one man!There were a few OBVIOUS cliches in this book that simply made me want to throw up! Titling a chapter \\"The Hall of the Mountain King\\" was just plain corny. I couldn't even concentrate on the text because the classical piece \\"The Hall of the Mountain King\\" was running through my head the entire time!Through and through, this book was okay, and Paolini did a great job on the cover art.

When the traders come Eragon finds out no one knows its worth.

Christopher delivers us a whole new world with its own history, ancient dialect and the topography that your travel in the book. The movie is not even 1/100 of the book quality, you could have seen the movie and read a totally different version in the book. The movie doesn't compare to the book not in the minimum. I can tell you because I saw the movie after I read the book, I learned in the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies that books are much better story tellers...(Dhh...) specially in this book. I do not recommend seeing this movie before tis book.

If you haven't seen it yet, don't waist your money. the only thing the movie has in common with the books is the characters.

Although very good for such a young author, it can't compare to much of the sci fi/fantasy I have read. The language of the book sounded like a young person with a thesaurus constantly by his side. I could have forgiven him for this except he made many of the characters also sound as if they kept a thesaurus by their side.The story itself is fun, if not entirely original. I am looking forward to the last book in the series and any future works by this author; I think that, as he matures, his originality and language will also."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a good book, although there are, unfortunately, plentiful flaws twined into the thick book.The concept is interesting, although I've heard that Eragon has drawn quite a bit from various books, such as Lord of the Rings. However, since I haven't read all of them, I really can't judge, although others have convinced me. In its own way though, I feel Eragon is quite unique though. The characters are pretty interesting overall.However, flaws abound. A good portion of what I feel as errors is the writing style. Paolini may have only been fifteen when he started to write the book, but that gives no excuse. In fact, by that age, in my opinion, he should have excellent, developed writing, capable of swaying an audience of presumably the identical age or less. Furthermore, the use of \\"said\\" is rare, often replaced with more technical words. Although sometimes that's good, most of the time, the characters are only \\"saying\\" the words. Finally, the last topic I would like to address is the use of words. Some are quite basic, while others are so advanced, they just seem out of context. Seriously, some words even adults wouldn't be able to understand.Overall though, it is a nice book, and I highly recommend it as a twelve-year old boy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My title says it all.

When I finally resorted to the book after boredom overtook me, I wasn't impressed. Halfway through I was still tempted to drop it. It didn't keep my interest for its lack of originality, and the reading level wasn't what I had expected. For younger/lower-level readers, this would probably make a lovely gift; however, I saw too many links to other writers and not enough of what I enjoy in a decent fantasy novel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For someone having just arrived at this site and reading the first review posted under the neatly segregated \\"customer reviews\\" section, I was appalled. If I had not read the book, I would not be interested in doing so. As luck would have it, however, I DID read the book first, and I was coming here looking for informaion on the sequel.First of all: I don't believe that this is a canned story. Although many of the elements were similar (if not identical) to such fantasy worlds as Middle Earth or stories such as Star Wars, most stories are built up from other people's ideas before they take on a life of their own. As another nineteen year old writer, who began my first novel at the same time that Mr. Paolini did, my world has evolved from a deviation of Middle Earth and Dungeons and Dragons, but then unique things begin to appear such as how magic works, the disposition of dragons, and the immensely detailed descriptions of halls from a long forgotten race. There were elements in the story of Eragon that were so unique I was bowled over with imagery, such as the immense size of the mountains and the richly detailed characters.One of the things that really struck me about this story was how real the characters were; it was not like a typical hero or epic story in which you know that nothing can happen to the main characters and people don't die. Sorry if this spoils anything, but people actually die in Eragon, people that in a more \\"typical\\" epic would have made it out without a scratch. And not only is the hero's \\"destiny\\" not clear to the characters, it is also beyond the reader. I don't think that Eragon will be the next benevolent reader, nor do I think he will remain with the Varden, but that's only the speculation of an excited reader who is looking for more of the story.In short, I adore this book and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy or just good storytelling. My nine year old sister has enjoyed it as much as my fourty six year old mother! It is an excellent first enstallment in the hopefully long career of Christopher Paolini."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As a lover of fantasy and science fiction novels, I completely enjoyed this book.

I stayed up till two o'clock in the morning every day for a week reading this book. The book grabs you (sorry to use the same phrase that has conformed to book reviews over the past few decades) by shoving you strait into the action of Algaesia (can't remember how to spell it) and immersing you into Eragon's adventure. After the adventure begins, one cannot stop reading. This book is full of the same wonder that made both Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and The Dark is Rising Sequence the beautiful books they are: a believable world that has surprises around every corner of the path. The only problem I had with the book was the \\"Question and Answer sections\\" between Eragon and a certain character of the book (don't want to give away any twists :-), but this is completely minor.I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone... the endless adventures of Eragon await!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book really isnt that bad.

Unsuccessful in his hunt, Eragon wanders back to his hometown, Carvahall, trying to sell the blue stone for some meat. When his trade is refused, he takes his stone back to his house. That night it hatches into a baby dragon! He attempts to keep the dragon secret, but is somehow found out by an evil adversary.Soon enough, Eragon finds himself on a magical quest with the aid of his dragon and an old \\"storyteller\\" named Brom. They are on a hunt to seek revenge on the evil that has taken something from Eragon. Something that he had a great affection toward. Throughout their journey, Brom teaches Eragon of his purpose on ALAGASIA. Eragon learns how to harness his new powers with Brom's help. With Saphira (Eragon's dragon) and Brom, Eragon learns of what he must do to stop the evil running through the land.This book is a real \\"page-turner\\"! With the exciting plot line and great character development, I couldn't put it down. Christoper Paolini creates an excitng story filled with engaging battle scenes and great descriptions of the landscape. It seemed like I was traveling with Eragon and felt his emotions through the entire story. I especially enjoyed flipping to the maps on the inside of both covers to follow Eragon's wandering path through ALAGASIA.I cannot believe a fifteen-year-old could write such a gripping tale! He excellently portrays Eragon and shows how he matures from a farm boy to a young man who learns a great deal as his adventure progresses. Paolini shows that all the choices Eragon makes will affect him (positively or negatively) in his future. Paolini is a mastermind and better hurry up writing the next book in the trilogy.

The story was engaging and you feel for the characters. completely different from the movie. I only have ONE complaint and that is about the abrupt ending. It almost seems like the author cut the story in half, for books one and two, without finishing his thought. It could have used a winding down of the story so that you feel it's time to wait for part two. Instead you turn the page and there is nothing there. BUT that is my opinion AND the story does very well in its continuation in part two; so have part 2 ready.

The lifestyle sufficed wonderfully for a boy who doesn't ask for much, but one day-on a hunting trip into The Spin, he finds a strange circular stone. It looks like pure diamond, a very valuable find indeed. But when peculiar events start happening around the rock, and strange men are in town looking for him, Eragon is more than a little worried about what is going to happen. It's time for him to learn the lessons of life fast and to step up to a position of leadership.Eragon is a very indulging story, which pulls you in on the first page. The story is not only a journey for the characters, but also for the reader. This is the kind of book you just have to read, even when it is midnight and you have school the next morning. A great book for children over the age of 11 all the way up to adult. This book contains character interaction, betrayals, and friendships; it has a long and deep plot that will make you wish it never ends.Chris Paolini is 19 years old. This is his first book, and it does not come with disappointment. He is now living with his parents and writing the sequel to Eragon, called The Eldest.Eragon is for anyone into adventure and fantasy.

Eragon is the first book in a series called the Inheritance. The next book will be called The Eldest. The book is about a boy that is 15 yrs old. While out on a hunt in the valley of a mountain he finds a very interesting stone. Not just any stone perhaps, but one that will alter him through a journey of magic, danger, and dragons! This boy, however, is Eragon and finds power way beyond of what he thought he had. If you're somebody who loves fantasy, adventure, and suspense this book is for you.I thought Eragon was the best book ever. It was full of very interesting and detailed writing that really gave me a sense of what the setting looked like. I could picture the scene right in my head. Eragon was full of action and adventure that really kept me reading. There was suspense at the end of every chapter, which made keep reading from chapter to chapter. Since I was at school reading this book, I had enough silence to remember and comprehend the parts that I just loved. Oh, and you kids out there woh sneak-read under the covers, you'll need many batteries for that flashlight of yours because this book will keep you reading and reading for the whole night.

It was in the charge of an Elven lady, who sent it towards safety, just before she was captured by a Shade.There's an irascible old wizard, Brom, masquerading as the village storyteller, and an evil, all-powerful Emperor - once a Dragonrider, who long since turned to this world's Dark Side. Naturally, he's after the egg, and also anxious to suborn the one who can get it to hatch. There are increasing incursions by brutish (orc-like) Urgals, and a Rebel alliance fighting the Emperor, including humans, dwarves, elves, and perhaps a traitor or two.The dragon egg chooses Eragon as its Rider, hatches, and they communicate telepathically. After Ra'zac (cowled dark riders) destroy Eragon's uncle's farm, he travels with Brom and his dragon Saphira in search of vengeance. Along the way, Brom trains him gradually in swordplay and in magic (are you surprised that he displays a talent for both?) and Saphira teaches him to be her Rider.All in all, it's a bit like Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings, with shadings of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern. But that's ok, as the author builds his own world and story out of these familiar elements. I especially like the nagging, caring relationship that develops between boy and dragon, and I appreciate the young hero's values, and his concern about killing even the bad guys.As the trio travel together, Eragon dreams of an Elven lady in need of rescue. He gains a prickly friend in Murtagh, who has a few secrets of his own. And eventually, in a race against time to save the lady, he reaches a marvellous rebel city-mountain, where he must carefully navigate tangled politics of man, dwarf and elf, while also dealing with the malevolence of the Twins.There's an exciting battle in a crescendo of a conclusion. What next? We wonder along with Eragon who his father might be. Could it possibly be the evil Emperor? It will be great fun to find out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love the Eragon book so much that I would read it a hundred times if I could.

But when a blue dragon hatches out of the stone, Eragon is thrust into a whirlwind of battles, magic, adventure, and monsters. He will have to survive battles with ork-like Urgals, slithery Ra'zac, and even a powerful and evil Shade if he is going to come out of it all alive. But he is not alone in his quest.

I don't remember being horrified, disgusted, bored, or any of that. Yes, the book obviously has some obvious elements of fantasy stories and other fantasy authors in it, but I don't think it's as bad as others are trying to say it is. I enjoyed the book; I liked the character of Saphira and even though people have said Brom is a copy of other mentor characters, it was hard for me not to like him, too. There were some other characters as well, like Ajihad's daughter (I can't remember how to spell her name),that I am eager to see what happens to in the next book.Eragon is not the absolute best fantasy book I have ever read, but it was enjoyable, and I am looking forward to reading the next book, Eldest. I know that the author is older now, and I am expecting even better things. I did not find Eragon boring, as others did, but then I love fantasy in many forms and have ploughed my way through many other bigger and more boring books than this one.

I gave this book 4 stars when i first read it, and though the bok is highly cliched, they are nice cliches i dont mind going through again and again. But after reading quite a deal, specially books about writing (preparing myself for a creative writing course), I rolled my eyes constantly at the way he uses language. In short, I agree with the bad reviews here, though not their harshest bits. Also, i dont agree with the \\"morally wrong\\" comments someone made, since Paolini does put such values to a, though vague, slight philosophical \\"analysis\\", or, mention more than analysis. Am in page 200, and i find myself asking if it is really worth it. Paolini, though promising, still needs a lot of training, and sometimes i feel like a very interesting children's book was put into untrained hands. He covers mundane uninteresting things with candy language, adorning them to the point it becomes insanely unflattering. His dialogue is also very lacking, taking an inhuman tone. The book feels like it is its own summary, a personal reminder for when the writer actually writes the book. There are themes the author, simply, didn't thought through enough. Itd be helpful if we could discuss it here, but I feel kinda vague, since this is just one of almost 2000 reviews. I gave it three stars since, although badly written, he has potential, the story is interesting, although a pain to go through for some. I always wondered why i took months to read it, now I do.. I went thru the 600 page long HP and the Half Blood Prince in 4 days, so, you can figure the difference. I was recently given Eldest and groaned at the size of it. Almost 700 pages of this writing! I read the first page, and e seems to have gotten better somewhat, but...ehh Am kinda interested in what happens, but it should have been edited by a responsible editor. I like that the author seems to have knowledge of a good deal of things, but is unable to express them into a novel. It feels, more often than not, like he is telling you these things, instead of narrating a story. And he sort of exagerates with the wound he recieves at the end. A scar that big sure is horrible, and hard to take in, but nothing that would make him a \\"cripple\\". Its not like he'll be vanished for being a freak or anything, geez...Cant tell you to go buy it or not. I dont regret it, but rationalizing about it, I dont know how this could have been published. It could be depressing for some writers to have been rejected, but this manuscript was accepted. I like the image he presents, humans probably being shown as very germanic-inspired peoples, but still, a good idea, badly written. I like the images overall, but, as a reader, I should rely on the writer to put them in me, not work em out on my own. Cliched, yes, but they are nice cliches we all like. It just needed to be in better hands. Sounds rough, but I do think, in all fairness, the guy has untapped talent. just needs to put hard work into the way he narrates.Conclusion:Pros: Whatever you decide works for you by reading this or any other review.Cons: 1)Too many metaphors and adjetives that distract and lessen the quality of the narration.2)There are concepts that seem like the author himself breaks their own logic (sorry to not be more specific. Shame on me)3)Poor characterization. Sometimes Eragon, a poor farm boy/hunter, says words that are out of character and are too sophisticated for him. With this the author confuses the reader often, and lessens the illusion of reality. Sometimes he puts things together that dont seem to go with his character. In one page he is one way, then, out of the blue, he is a genius who knows what to do. It could have worked if the author would have been conscient of this change.Thats how I felt."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought Eragon was a really good book!!

I would recommend that anyone who likes excitment, action, and a good story to read this book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I didn't get into this book quickly and was worried at the beginning that it would be cheesy, but after reading for a while the pacing and character interaction were quite decent and I enjoyed it. I don't have much original to add to the reviews that have already been written, but I would have enjoyed this story more if it were more original. Lots of elements seemed to have been repeated from other fantasy novels, including a fight that takes place between a lake and a gate into a mountain that is right out of _Fellowship of the Rings_. Also, the plot twists were predictable, as when a character goes \\"wow, I never would have guessed that...\\" and I wanted to be like, the reader has had this figured out for about 200 pages now! There is a character named Arya in George R.R. Martin's series who is also a left-handed swordswoman, this is probably coincidental, unless the author was familiar with that series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, By Christopher Paolini, FanatasyI would recommend this book to people who are into fantasy and into action books. The reasons why I liked this book was because it had a lot of action in it. Eragon goes into battle and Paolini gives great details about it. The towns people burn a house down and the way that Paolini describes the fire and the feelings of the people are amazing.Another reason why I had liked this book was because of the bond between Eragon and Saphira. I love how their bond is so strong. Whenever Eragon needs Saphira to help him get some place faster she is ready to go.But, the thing I love most about this book would have to be the hidden humor in it. I especially love the part when Eragon is trying to name the dragon and he isn't sure whether or not the dragon is a boy or a girl.Eragon is one of those books that you will pick up and never want to put down. It's a book for bothe boys and girls of all ages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book has very good characters. They grow and develop quite well.

There are very few books that I will read more than once but this is one that makes my list. Christopher Paolini's talent is that he brings his characters to life in a way that makes you feel as if you know them. Paolini includes action, intrigue, suspense, mystery; all of the components that would entice you to want more of the story. If you like fantasy this book will make you lose yourself in its pages. I could not put it down. If you choose the audio version, Gerard Doyle is superb in his portrayal of the characters. Its amazing how through changing his voice Doyle can individualize each character to a point where they have their own distinct, recognizable personalities. If you like this book and want to continue the story the 2nd and 3rd books, \\"Eldest\\" and \\"Brisinger\\", also written by Paolini are just as captivating as \\"Eragon\\". I am impatiently waiting for the fourth book to come out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Do you want a series with dragons, elves and magic? Then read the Eragon series!

I see nothing to justify the hype about this book!The book is long on details and the pace of the story drags to the point of putting the reader to sleep. The fights, either with swords or magic spells are quick and end within 1 to 2 pages and then its back to long pointless details and prodding story telling. Like, who cares how it takes to make a dragon saddle or how it takes to walk 10 miles?The 'hero' of the story Eragon doesnt seem to learn from his mistakes and continues to make the same type of mistakes over and over again every time he uses magic when fighting! Plus the constant repeating of the fall of the dragon riders and the rise of the evil king gets boring after reading it for the 3rd or 6th time!I eagerly await the second or third printing of book 1, as well as book 2 and hopefully the author will learn from his mistakes with book 1 and make book 2 a more interesting story.Change the settings and some of the charaters, pick up the pace of the story and you have a good sci-fi or star wars type of story here."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"All fantasylovers will praise this action-packed book.15 year old Eragon is hunting and finds a mysterious sapphire 'stone' wich leads to a new life.This epic tale is full of elves,dwarves,magic,dragons,and tragedies.Anyone who reads this book will go crazy waiting for the next one in the series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When my mom first bought Eragon for me for Christmas I was somewhat reluctant to read it, but by the time I was done I wished I had started it much sooner.Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, is a book about a boy living in the world Algasia here evil monsters roam, a tyrannical king rules, and dragons once filled the skies. Now; however, the world hasn't seen a dragon for many decades and a poor farmer boy named Eragon is about to receive a wonderful gift from fate. When he finds a mysterious blue rock in the forest that turns out to be a dragon egg Eragon is thrust into a world he never knew existed, and launched into a quest that shall be forever told in legend.I really liked this book because it kept me always turning to the next page. I like how there is almost never a lull in the action, but when there is it is still interesting. I also love how Eragon's dragon, Saphira, is portrayed as an equal, or superior to humans instead of portraying it as a stupid animal.Eragon is an all around gnarly book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book beats out, by far, all of the other fantasies that I have read, and I have read a bunch of fantasies, including Dragonlance and Harry Potter.

First I thought it was going to be a chore to read this book, but after a couple of pages, I found out that it was actually a hobby. I really enjoyed this book, and cannot wait of the next Inheritance book to come out. I heard that there is going ot be a movie coming that is called Eragon, I can't wait to see it. I recommend this book to everyone who is a fan of fantasy books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is the first novel in the Inheritance series and Christopher Paolini's debut as an author. It is a fine start for a young author and refreshingly devoid of the detailed political machinations and intrigues of the current crop of fantasy titles. Much less space is devoted to a detailed history of rulers and place and the politics of particular groups, nations, and cities than say George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones or Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. The cast of characters is smaller and includes a dragon. All of which I found rather refreshing after the laborious reads of Martin and Jordan. Though it lacks depth, the book is an engaging read. The text is clear and free of the wordy prose of Janny Wurts.Eragon moves forward rather swiftly - perhaps too swiftly. My problem with the Wheel of Time is that everything, including character development, moves at an excruciatingly slow pace. But Eragon tends toward the opposite. It seems as if Paolini is attempting to equip Eragon, the main character of the book, for the coming storm too quickly. How does he do it? By creating a character that becomes what he is more from some unique innate talent than effort. Eragon does have to work at it to be sure. However, Paolini has him learn to read, become a master swordsman, and a seasoned warrior in less than a year's time. Indeed, after besting Brom, his teacher, he is told that there are few in the land capable of matching his skill.The idea of riding dragons certainly isn't unique - you have only to read Anne McCaffrey's books to know that. But it is a story element I like and I am delighted that Paolini has resurrected not only the idea but the mental bond between rider and dragon. Dragons and other magical creatures, like the elves and shades, are endowed with physical and magical powers far beyond not only what any human has but is able to achieve. Eragon is told, by Brom that in a contest with any of these beings he would be defeated. Paolini reinforces this throughout the book. The problem is that this makes Eragon's survival, and eventual victory, in a number of physical and magical encounters with a shade far less believable. Eragon has his own magical ally in the form of Saphira his dragon companion (who, incidentally, is conspicuously absent during Eragon's battles with the shade). And since the powers of a dragon aren't fully understood, even by them, it is easy enough to extract his hero from situations well beyond him through a mysterious power that seems to defy the rules of magic as explained by Brom. Paolini uses this crutch only a few times in Eragon; I hope it is used not at all in the next book.Considering that the author was 15 when he started writing the book I think these criticisms are minor. He isn't a Michael Moorcock, Ursula Le Guin, or Robert Silverberg - at least not yet. He has potential and I will be reading the next installment in this series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am only 10 years old,and I thought that this book was FANTASTIC. If you like the Harry Potter books(which I happen to love)than I'm sure you'll like this one. The author completely captures the confused,angry,sad,and happy emotions that the characters feel throughout the book.I must say that I am astounded at how good this book is when the author was so young. I don't know what could make you vote this book less than 3 stars. It is a bit violent,but it is at the same time magical,enchanting,and sometimes just downright confusing. This is the kind of book that will keep you up way past your bedtime trying to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was a little hesitant to read this book at first, because I heard it was written by a 15 year old, and I figured the language or concept would be immature. Plus, with Lord of the Rings being so hot these days, the title Eragon was a bit too similar. But then I kept hearing people say they enjoyed the story. So I gave it a try. I am glad I did. While I cannot give it a 5 star, reserving that for the Harry Potters, Bilbos and Lyras, I feel a 4 star does not do it justice. It is a good tale, and I will look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy when it is published. Certainly the reviewers who say it leans on Tolkien, Pullman and Star Wars are right: There are elves, and elvish language, and swords with names. There is a daemon-like link between dragon and rider. There is an echo of \\"Empire\\" with underdog rebels. But that homage should not diminish the originality of the weaving of this tale, which evolves rapidly taking unexpected turns, or the language, which is deceptively easy even elegant. Descriptions of places and events are easy to visualize without being wordy or burdensome. Characters retain some mystery, coaxing curiosity about the obstacles ahead, and how they will slip past them. All in all, I enjoyed this book, and wish I did not have to wait to continue the story. It is a remarkable beginning for its young author; I will be very interested to see where his writing, and imagination, will lead."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To everyone who keeps saying that the themes in this book have been done before, I do agree that there are many parallels between Eragon and The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, and other fantasy series. However, as a book for young people, I still think it is well-written and enjoyable and very well done for a teen-age author. I don't think many kids his age could do as well. Most kids are not going to sit there and analyze the story and criticize it because it's too much like another book. Kids just enjoy a good story that keeps them engrossed, and these days I'm in favor of anything that will keep kids reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For all of you who are down on this book, let's keep in mind that this is a CHILDREN'S book.

The author writes this book with so many descriptive words it's as if you were watching a movie of it.This book is wonderful; I give it two thumbs up. The author, Christopher Paolini is a genius for writing this book. He wrote this book while he was in high school and published it when he graduated at age fifteen. This book was a bestseller the first week it came out.The price of this book is average for eighteen dollars. That is the price of a hardback issue.

A readable yarn, although it reads very much like a first novel written by a teenager with considerable parental editing assistance, which, as it happens, is exactly what it is. Sort of a swords-and-sorcery Mad Lib - the author selects McCaffrey's rideable dragons, Tolkien's elves, dwarves, and orcs (the latter under an assumed name, but they're still orcs, no mistaking that), magical powers, an evil king, a damsel in distress, swords (of course!), and then adds a hero coincidentally of about the same age and gender as the author himself, mixes them all together using a really motley assortment of standard fantasy place- and people-names, and there we have it, yet another offering in a genre which deserves better than this.Nonetheless, Mr. Paolini has done well for a teenager, and I would hope that the second and third books show improvement - the author may well cringe in later years when this work is mentioned."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After hearing this book built up as the next coming of Tolkien, I was disappointed and disturbed to actually read it.

It was amazingly written; I've read books by adults who couldn't even compete with Paolini's technique/style. This book was full of such extreme detail that I felt like I was living through Eragon. I was blown away by this book.However, I have found that many people think that Eragon was a sloppy piece of writing. Some have said that Eragon cried and fainted too much. I suppose you would cry too if you lost the people you loved! And, as I read in another review, there IS a difference between fainting and getting knocked out.Another fact that I have picked up is that people think that Eragon was put together by copying from other works of writing, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I strongly oppose this; writers can get their inspiration from other things, but their work is entirely their own. The fact that a teenager wrote this book and had it published is amazing! It takes skill to write even the worst book and have it published, and to write something this good when he was only 15...it's just beyond words.Overall, this was an amazing book.

Unsuccessful in his attempts, he takes the stone back to his cabin and lets it sit there --- until it hatches into a beautiful blue dragon. Eragon realizes he can talk to this secret pet dragon with his mind, and eventually learns that he and the dragon are part of a legacy of secret heroes called the Riders.With the help of Brom, a wise man, Eragon matures into his destiny. The challenges he faces include fighting a long-standing war, helping an ethereal elf, and dealing with tragedy and revenge. Certain details, such as Eragon's revelation that he cannot read, develop this rich work and blend together to produce a number of plot twists.

Now 19, he has already established himself as an exciting new creator whose influences include Tolkien, McCaffrey, and others.

It takes the normal fantasy reads about dragons to an entirely new level, with a bunch of twists to make it interesting (I could go on and on about all the new looks at the old subject of dragons, but I don't want to spoil the story).Eragon, the main character, finds a dragon egg, and is cast into a world of suspense, danger, and most of all, MAGIC. You really get to know him and all of his feelings. You can symphasize (hope thats spelled right ;)) with all of his feelings and emotions, and feel like you're right there with him.

And while I have to say, yes, at the beginning one cannot help but think about Tolkien and compare the two (it's inevitable), but after the first couple chapters, I forgot all about the comparisons and got into the story for its own merits. There are many ways to depict a struggle between men, dragons, elves and dwarves without 'ripping off' Tolkien. And Christopher Paolini's mythology of the Dragon Riders is absorbing, as is the the wonderful relationship between Eragon and his dragon Saphira. I found myself racing to the end of the book, and I can't wait for the release of Book 2. So read it for its own sake, not because people say it's a take on Tolkien.

My daughter had to read this book for school (6th Grade) and she thoroughly loved it. In fact, she talked about it so much, I started reading it. The book is absolutely addictive. It has a lot of intense action and is so imaginative. It is happy, sad, tense, passionate and flows so well. It has many wonderful lessons about life for children to learn through reading it. Because my daughter and I loved it so much, my son (4th Grade) started reading it and finished it in 3 days!! This book is huge but you just can't put it down. Needless to say, we now how Eldest - which will keep us busy for a while. We all agree that Christopher Paolini has a wonderful gift of imagination and we are so glad that he is sharing it with the world! This in our opinion is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini is a very talented author but the idea of his book is over-used.

I am glad now that they did not.I am a person who loves to read a good story. I like what I like and I have to say that it was far more enjoyable for me to read this book than many of the big name authors Mr. Paolini has been accused of mimicking. Original storylines and plots are so rare these days, that I suspect that they might actually be extinct.What this young author has done for me though, is to present a story that I enjoy reading. It doesn't matter that it may share similarities with another author's stories. I will simply have to take the critics' word for it, because the other authors in question could not hold my interest long enough for me to finish any of their \\"original\\" works of literature.So I thank this young author for giving me an enjoyable read. Who knows, maybe I will actually give the other, more established, writers another chance because him."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a decent book for the target audience of older children and preteens, who have finished the Harry Potter books and The Hobbit but might find Lord of the Rings too difficult. Its strong points are a good pacing and excitment level. But the big downside of it is the lack of originality. Alagaesia is very much a simpler version of Tolkien's Middle Earth, especially the Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs/Urgals. The noble Dragonriders who are telepathically bonded to their dragons are straight out of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern; she must have been flattered by this imitation to have given the testimony on the back cover. But most important and most annoying is that the plot and characters are lifted straight from the first STAR WARS movie. Luke Skywalker was a young man of uncertain parentage whose uncle was killed by soldiers of the Empire, who turned to a wise Jedi Master and began his training in the ways of the Force and joined the Rebellion, until the old Jedi Master was killed and passed his powers on to Luke. Along the way Luke teamed up with a scoundrel who helped him rescue a beautiful princess from the clutches of the Empire. The movie ends with the Rebellion acheiving a great although not final victory over the evil empire, and Luke leaves to go to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with Master Yoda. In this book, the sf world is changed to a Tolkien-fantasy world, Luke is renamed Eragon, Obi-Wan is renamed Brom, and Han Solo is Murtagh. If the second and third books of this trilogy continue to follow the Star Wars trilogy, the second book will start with Galbatorix's forces attacking a secret base of the Varden again, but Eragon will travel to the Mourning Sage in Ellesmera to complete his training; however he will get a warning that Murtagh and Arya are in danger and leave his training before he has full control of his powers. Book two should end with Eragon confronting Galbatorix and learning to his horror that he is Galbatorix's son, while Murtagh is captured by the Empire. But Eragon will rescue him early in Book three, then go back to the Mourning Sage who will die, and Book Three should end with Eragon defeating Galbatorix and the Varden defeating the Empire, and Eragon founding a new order of Dragonriders to bring peace and justice to the Galaxy (err, Alagaesia). Anyway, you get the point. But it's still a fun book, and younger readers won't mind the lack of originality as much as adults will."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is the best book ever because of the great imagination of Christopher Paolini.

Eragon gave me the patients to start a \\"Harry Potter\\" book without falling away from interest. No book could ever match its excellence, I know because that book has kept me occupied longer than any book I've read. At the back of the book the foreign language is translated for you. The author provides action,suspense,and vivid details for mind-eye picture. This story is about a struggling farm boy who finds what he thinks is an ordinary polished blue stone, So he takes it to a merchant to find out how much it is worth, and that night the egg hatches and choses him as its rider.

But i am only 8, and i still have a lot more time to read! All in all, this was a great book. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The author has tried to mesmerize us with queer sounding names, innumerable characters and a convoluted story. The word Eragon for example- just replace the d of dragon wth the next letter and hey presto! You get a serviceable name! The story goes about in fits and starts, and many questions remain unanswered- how did Brom hide the sign of the rider on his palm, how did Angela reach the dwarves' city, and how could Eragon kill the Shade inspite of being overmatched? The character of Eragon is very weak- he needs a lot of help from whoever his companions are- Murtagh, Brom, Arya, Angela, Saphira.... The book feels suspiciously like a Tolkien novel, without the magnificent language. Still, inspite of all these, the author has done a decent job. After all, he was only 19 when he finished the book. The command over language and his skill in handling such a large number of characters are impressive. I read the book in two days flat- it was engrossing all right! I hope he will improve in the sequel (Eldest), which, I believe, will be published next year."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Allow me a desperate cry when I say, \\"When are we going to find a young writer who can actually WRITE??\\" I had my hopes up for Paolini, but just like every single young writer I've read so far, it drizzles down to just crap. (Mad props go only to S.E. Hinton and Mary Shelley, who are the lone proof that young writers could do anything.)Age shouldn't even be a factor in judging this book, actually. I should be able to read this book without knowing a THING about the author, and be able to come out of it saying that it was a good book. Period. And this was NOT, not by a long shot. The storyline could not possibly be more cliche. I am so tired of reading stale sword-and-magic fantasies that give the genre and Tolkien a bad name, more of his elves and dwarves and little heroes who just happen to have EVERYTHING going in their favor. More magical \\"things\\" to go on a quest for, for no apparent reason. More \\"oh, my family was killed. bummer\\" and \\"oh, I must save the beautiful elven princess because she has absolutely nothing to do with anything!\\" This plot was a complete failure. There's no cause and reaction, just a bunch of \\"I have to do this because it's my destiny\\" drivel.The writing itself isn't anything overly impressive, either. I became irritated by the end of the prologue. As other reviewers have said, too many adverbs and avoidances of \\"said\\", which is a sin for all writers except the grandmasters. The Shades speak in boring monotone, with overused phrases like \\"[Insert command here], or die.\\" (What kind of villainous name is \\"shade\\", anyway? Gee, really original.) I don't need to know that Eragon was angry, I need to be able to see in my head his facial reaction and deduce that he was angry. The theme is too shallow, the writing is too mediocre, and if it weren't for all the undeserved hype of this thing, I would've left it in the bookstore.Not even considering the sequel. I'd much rather delve into Storm Constantine's trilogy or more Jacqueline Carey, who know what they're doing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Harry Potter didn't do it.

It's sloppily written, derivative, and just plain boring. I felt like I'd read this book about 30 times before.Quick note for you folsk who are coming to Paolini's defense about blatantly ripping off Tolkien. Tolkien took loose \\"ideas\\" from Norse/Scandinavian myth, such as Elves, Dwarves, etc. He then imbued them with HIS OWN ORIGINAL racial characteristics, abilities, languages(yes--often based on other languages), etc. Thwey became something they never had been before--a sum that was greater than the parts it consisted of. These \\"fantasy races\\" have been copied all over the place, from the original Dungeons & Dragons game (does anyone actually play that anymore or did Magic kill it?) to a slew of imitator novelists. What makes Chris Paolini's book so patehtic is that he didn't even TRY to modify his races, and in some cases came up with ridiculous new names to try to mask his lack of creativity (such as his weak attempts at \\"hiding\\" orcs, Uruk-Hai, Nazgul, etc.) His races are a pale and transparent imitation of those found in Tolkien.Great authors like Tolkien take other ideas, mold and shape them, and make them their own. Pathetic authors like Paolini try to simply work with the clay droppings the masters have left on the floor. Following this analogy to its logical conclusion, Mr. Paolini insn't a very good author and he sure as heck is a terrible potter. Save your money folks--this book stinks."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ok, I picked it up because of the outrageous prices it commands in the collectors editions. Also my kid liked it. Well as an adult reading it, I was disappointed. I haven't been able to force myself to finish it. If there is a story here, I haven't found it and I'm 1/3 the way through it.For me the things that bug me about the book, besides the flat characters, is the mistakes in basic things like making a saddle, or riding horses, or fighting with a sword or hunting with a bow. It's clear that the author has never looked close at or done any of them. That someone shows up early with a cool sword and he lets the Dragon carry it. I mean come-on! What teenage boy would let this out of his sight? Yes he knows that he's no good with it yet but to not want to carry it???? And his mentor keeps saying stupid stuff like \\"I'll tell you when you need to know\\". Lame. Tell me now, I just asked. If I thought I wasn't ready to hear I wouldn't have asked.So as they plod through the wilderness looking for evil do-ers who are way more prepared than they are, to bushwhack them as their only chance, I don't really care anymore.Oh Yeah, people who live off the land don't notice a huge dragon suddenly living in the forest next to them...

I can't believe it was written by a 17-year-old! It did have a younger hand of writing in certain spots, but the novel was wonderful all the same. This story was one of the best adventure novels I have read in a long time and this was also the first dragon story I have ever read. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did. I normally don't read many fantasy novels, but I am glad I finally read this one. It doesn't have too much fantasy or too little, which is one thing I loved about this story. The story line was amazing and kept me waiting to see what would happen next or what path Eragon would choose. I have also watched the movie. I watched the movie before I read the book and have to say I loved the movie and the book almost the same. The one thing I liked more about the book was that it really let you know the journey Eragon had to go through and how he grew up into a man at heart and in mind. It also gave more insight to the characters, however, I think all books do a better job at that than movies do. In my opinion I would watch the movie first and then read the novel because Eragon is only the first book to the series.Eragon (Inheritance)The only thing that I did not like about this book was that I had no idea until I was done reading it that there is a guide in the back of the book and shows you how to pronounce places and names, it tells you the magic words (or ancient language) and what the words mean, it tells you words from the dwarf language and what they mean, and it tells you a little bit about the language the urgal's used.

Eragon, as a character, is presented beautifully.I highly recommend this book to anyone from young adults to adults."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a fantasy tale like no other. It is based in the fictional place call Alagaesia in a small village called Carvahall where the main character Eragon lives with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran. While he is hunting in the mountains called The Spine he comes across a blue and sliver stone, which he tries to sell to get meat for family. When the trappers come in to sell their stuff and buy supplies for their next trip Eragon finds out that the stone isn't really a stone at all, but some thing else. Later that night something woke him up and his \\"stone\\" was actually an egg and it hatch's in to a beautiful blue dragon which he names Saphira (after a old dragon long before he was born) which saves him from death from two monsters called the Ra'zac that destroyed his house and injured his uncle very badly. He sets out on a quest to kill these Ra'zac with the old village storyteller named Brom. In their quest they lost the trail left by the Ra'zac and look for the Varden the rebel alliance to the evil king Galbatorix while they head for the Varden. Brom and Eragon train in swords man ship, magic, and learns how to write other types of letters. The three of them get in battles with fierce urgals wich are kind of like half human half goat but are really ugly looking and pretty strong. Eragon also got captured and was face to face with a shade (a human that is controlled by evil spirits) and is forced to call apon his dragon to save him. the ending is pretty cool but I won't ruin it for you. This is a great book and before I read this book I didn't realy like fantasy books now I love them, and you lucky devils won't have to wait for the second book in the seires called Eldest which I and reading at the moment. I suggest that since there is so many complicated words in this book that only ages 10 and up read this wonderful book.This will certify that the above work is completely original.Skyler Reffett"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is probably my favorite book,but i still have 36 more pages to go.Eragon is a farmboy who is VERY poor.

I realize the kid is a teenager but did he have to throw every single plot device ever invented into the story? Did he have to preface every action with his own thoughts and questions? If he took three years to edit it, what in the world did it look like in the rough draft?

He asks for dragon names. He names her Saphira. One day the Ra'zac come and destroy the farm. He sets out to avenge his uncle's death. Brom says he has no choice but to bring him. They set out for the journey of a lifetime. In one village they found everyone dead and their bodies in a huge pile. Eragon is captured by the enemy.I would say anyone could read this book.

The plot and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Poorly written cross of Pern, Middle Earth, and all the rest. You'll find yourself stumbling over tedious descriptions and unneccessary dialog tags trying to read a story that you feel you're read before... This is, quite frankly, the kind of writing you find in online fan fiction."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Need I say more? I dived into this book eagerly expecting epic tales in proportion to its length, and all I got was cliched, ripoff (Star Wars, anyone?) vaguely entertaining stuff.There is no graceful writing here, folks. Nope, it's not reminiscent of Tolkien. Rather, it conspicuously reeks of the plotline from Star Wars (I could make a loong, long, list of rip-offed plotlines, scenes, characters, etc.) which continues into Eldest.While the author manages to keep our attention from sliding off most of the time by inserting a dragon here, an orkish creature there, some swords, etc., must of the time I am stunned by the stoicism, the awkward and heaving writing (does it feel like to anyone else that Paolini wrote this with a thesaurus by his side?) The uneven flow and the tedious one-dimensional characters, especially that irksome Eragon is enough to make anyone cry.\\"Hey, he was seventeen, give him a break,\\" you guys argue. You know what? There are a great deal of 17-year-old writers with vastly more impressive material, with greater depth. Just look at a few annual Scholastic Writing winners. Apparently their only shortcomings are no publisher-parents or an attractive book cover. Look at others near his age - from S.E. Hinton to Jane Austen, overall, Paolini's work is tolerable but certainly does not deserve all this hype or fame.I advise him to read some more literature, go to college, take some classes and buff up his skills, and come back with a little less atrociously prominent plagiarizing and better writing skills."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm going to be honest from the get-go: I have never read any J.R.R. Tolkein, nor Piers Anthony, nor any other writer of what I would call \\"classic fantasy,\\" meaning pretty much anything to do with dragons, magic, elves, orcs, demons, and so on and so forth and blah blah blah yackity smackity. I've seen bits and pieces of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, and I read a tiny snippet of one of the Pern novels in middle school as a class assignment, but by and large, classic fantasy just isn't my thing. So when I first picked up Eragon on a hunch and started reading, and my first thought was that this was the most derivative book I'd ever read, I took that as a very, very bad sign. Eragon is, to put it bluntly, such a blatant ripoff of such a large number of works that even people who would rather hang themselves than have anything to do with Frodo and his ilk will find themselves shaking their head and wondering how anybody could have read this book and found it worthy of a publishing contract. Of course, the jaded part of me can't help but notice that the gamble apparently paid off, and the world has laid immense riches at the feet of Christopher Paolini in spite of his work's flaws.To be sure, there are glimmers of talent here and there; Eragon is, after all, quite a complex novel, and not the sort of thing that the majority of mid- to late-teenage aspiring writers would be capable of producing. (It's worth noting, though, that the author also graduated from high school at fifteen, an achievement which already places him on a tier significantly above most fifteen-year-olds.) Now, if that was the context in which I had read this novel--if, for example, I was a high-school English teacher reading this as the work of one of my students--it would be fine. I would probably give it a B minus, in fact, maybe appending a note reading \\"Develop your own voice!\\" or something along those lines. But that's not the context in which the reading public is asked to view Eragon, and that's where it all falls apart. We're asked to view this not as a mildly impressive but far-from-perfect work by a young wannabe writer, but as a professional work by a professional auteur, and I'm sorry to say, it's just not. The story is patched together--and pretty roughly patched, at that--from the most recognizable parts of other, more well-known works, the dialogue isn't particularly well-written, and the whole thing just comes off as silly. Even the constructed languages, such as they are, are ridiculous; a quick glance through any language's primer (average length: half a page) reveals that there's no real structure at work, no identifiable syntax, merely a pastiche of nonsense syllables that, when strung together and said aloud, sound kind of cool. Eragon's saving grace, it seems, has been the fact that it was marketed largely to an audience that knew nothing of Eragon's source material, and frankly, I'm baffled that any adult could read Eragon and not laugh or groan out loud. My advice: Give Christopher Paolini another decade or so in which to develop his own style, then come back and see what he can give us. As for Eragon, the only advice I can give is to just leave it alone and go read something else, because if you're even tangentially familiar with anything connected to the word \\"fantasy,\\" you're in for a massive disappointment."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My aunt lent me Eragon and it sat on my shelf for months before I finally started to read it begrudgingly. I felt this sort of rolled-eyed annoyed sigh feeling that I HAD to read it since half the world already had and there was going to be a movie and I didn't want to be out of the proverbial loop. Working in the publishing industry, I had heard a lot of bad press about this book and a good many rumors that it was no good, so I wasn't exactly excited about the prospect. That and I hate the sort of fantasy that it purports to be with a pronunciation key and lots of long annoying names to remember.Firstly, as one who reads rather often, it becomes evident from the start that this book is not well written. Characters are not well developed, descriptions are sparse and often of random and unimportant things, events unfold choppily and so forth. But the author was so young when he wrote it, I am going to give him those. You can't really condone someone's writing who is barely done with high school let alone college. For someone of his age, this is an excellent book. Heck, for someone of my age, this is an excellent book. Browse through an editor's slush pile for a few moments and you'll realize that he has out-written a great many other would be authors out there.The beginning plodded along but it wasn't until a few chapters in that I found myself interested. By the end I was reading the book as fast as I could, holding the book in one hand while I did things around the house. Is this a story you've read before? Absolutely. But you liked it last time which is why you read it and you'll like it this time around as well. Is this great literature to be put upon the shelf with Tolkien? Absolutely not. But like the popcorn fest it's soon to become, it's an enjoyable story with just enough new twists to keep you interested and it's entertaining enough that you can excuse the author's inexperience with telling stories and just enjoy the story he is telling.I took at trip to the library today to pick up the second book in the series and I will be interested to see if the author can still keep my interest but, for now, Paolini has my respect. Maybe it's because I am a writer and I know how hard writing a book of that length is that I can overlook the imperfections and just enjoy the story. Description, character development and that stuff is important but all of it isn't worth beans unless there's a good story underneath and he's already got that so I think we can cut him some slack."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I personally enjoyed the book. It was a fun, entertaining read, without all the long boring descriptions Tolkien uses in his lord of the rings trilogy. Sure I enhoyed the movies but the books? No way. I tried, and tried, and tried to finish them, but they were sooo beyond boring. I mean, the author spent a whole page talking about how many steps they took (okay, so that was an exageration on my part, but hey, how many of you reviewers out there are doing the same about this book?). But still, the guy didn't know when to quit with the descriptions, and you think eragon is overdescriptive?YOu see, that's the thing. People are different, and have different tastes. Some people hate any descriptiveness at all, while others like lots of it, and still others like a little, but not too much. So, for the reviewers, you really shouldn't be telling everyone \\"don't read it, it's horrible\\" OR \\"read it, otherwise you'll miss out on the phenomenon of the century\\" cuz you don't got a clue (yes, i know that's not proper english and some clown's gonna make a stupid comment about it, anyways...)as to what the people reading your review actually enjoy reading. So, really you should say what's wrong with it or what's so great about it(Besides the overly stressed, it's a cheap rip off, or a sloppily put together mess of other people's work and it's great, or it's adventure packed, and then not talking about any of the adventure, how bout giving some examples of the stupidity or greatness of the book people?), and why you hated, or loved it, and you should talk about the story itself, not the author's age, or the hype about it. Let the people choose for themselves whether they wanna read it or not. (Yes, i know, i'm not talking about the story either, but hey, i'm gettin to it)Oh, and it's getting real old with every story that has elves is a rip off of tolkien and every story with dragons is a rip off of anne mcaffery, and every story with magic done differently is a rip off of the earth sea books. I mean, come on! Do you actually believe that to be true? Oh,and my personal favourite, every story with a boy who's an orphan is a rip off of the great star wars.SO, on to the story. Well, it's about a young boy who lives on a farm and finds a stone. Hmm...i'm not so good at summaries, and everyone else has talked about it, so you really don't need me to tell you the story again. So, people there's my review. And if you're interested but don't wanna spend money, you can always check it out from a library. THat's how i first read it, but then again, i hardly ever buy books. I bought it afterwards though. SO yeah. Here i go, rambling on and on like a lunatic. Sometimes i think i am, but i'm cool with that. But i spose somebody will find a way to turn that against me, like \\"Hey, don't listen to that crazy person down there, they're probably living in a nuthouse.\\" WOw, that would be funny. Hmmm.....i spose nobody's probably reading any of this rambling of mine, if so well, i'd just like to thank my family and my close friends for all the help and support they gave me during this time. And i guess that's it. I'm out.

Eragon is a well deserved success and a great fantasy novel full of hope, loss, and adventure. Eragon, a young farm boy, discovers an egg containing a blue dragon that changes his life. The tense, action filled story will lead readers through battles and into mystical places that keep the pages turning, despite the length. You'll have to pay attention, for many of the names, etc. are very original and unfamiliar. My fifteen year old certainly wasn't turned away by the size of the book and cannot wait to read the next one.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Firstly, I have to say I disagree with all you reviewers who say this book totally ripped things off of other books.You say the plot is the same. The plot is ALWAYS the same in fantasy, haven't you noticed? Unexpected hero rises up to save the world, and maybe sometimes (In Star Wars and other books,) They find a long-forgotten sibling. So what if the plot is the same? It's how the story progresses, what the characters are like, the action, the suspense, the quality if the writing (which is AWESOME for a 15 year old, I might add), the villains and how evil they are, the little plot twists, the heart wrenching moments, how good the ending is (does the book end too fast and unsatisfactorally, or is the ending descriptive and at a good pace?), and many more things that really matter in fantasy. Come on, give Christopher Paolini a break, ok, I mean, he made up THREE languages, which I think is very impressive. Can you make up three languages? In that case, do you have the perserverence to get a book published? Try it sometime, I know from experience, writing a book and getting it published is not easy.So, this is still a good book, rip-off or not. Get past your biased thoughts that Christopher Paolini ripped things off your favorite book and read Eragon for what it is. (If you write a book, see if YOU can write a book without ripping anything off from other books!)In Eragon, the main character, Eragon, is a young teen youth who is hunting in the Spine mountain range when he comes across a strange, blue, polished stone. It is about a foot long, and he brings it to his home in Carvahall, hoping he might be able to sell it for money for his family (his cousin and uncle).Well, before Eragon can sell the stone, it hatches-and out comes a dragon. Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle in the woods, and later, some strange beings called Ra'zaacs sent by Galbatorix, the evil ruler of Alagaesia, where the story takes place, come to Carvahall and destroy his home-and kill his uncle. Eragon suspects they were looking for the stone-egg, so he and the dragon Saphira, and their unexpected guest, Brom the storyteller, flee Carvahall.Eragon learns from Brom that he must be destined to be a Dragon Rider, like in the ancient stories, the Dragon Riders who battled evil shades and Ra'zaacs (Evil beings). Brom teaches all he knows about the Dragon Riders from the stories he tells to Eragon.Brom also tells Eragon that he may be one of the last Dragon Riders-there are only two unhatched dragon eggs left, and that Eragon is destined to destroy Galbatorix, the immortal ruler of Alagaesia.Whether or not Eragon will succeed will remain to be seen.I highly reccommend this book to ANYONE of any age, because this is a wonderful fantasy, and all should be able to enjoy it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I found the quality of writing in Eragon to be lacking, and the moral code less than adequate. I was disappointed, because the plot was engrossing, and Paolini showed potential skill. Many of the sideplots were predictable to the point where I couldn't tell if they were examples of a new style of writing that showed how low the bestsellers have stooped, or if they were just holes in his \\"quality writing skills\\". His writing was strong in the beginning of the book, but it slackened off towards the middle part.As for the low moral code: There was character in the story who said that whether stealing was right or wrong was based on your point of view. At another point, the main character tried to bribe a guard to let him into a certain room, and when the guard did not let him in, he snuck in through means of deceit. I don't care if this was for the greater good, it was still wrong.All in all, it wasn't a terrible book, but I think I'll stick to Tolkien from now on."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I picked up the book to see what all the hype was about. While parts of the story are intriguing, I found the language of the book too stilted and the progression of the story to be confusing. There is so much detail in every description, that I often found myself missing key plot points; I had too many, \\"wait, where did s/he come from?\\" moments. I also thought that the development of Eragon as a hero was not compelling. In this book, there is not enough \\"ah, ha!\\" moments to understand why Eragon would be a Rider and destined to save this world. I think more is to come with the other books in the trilogy, but this factor was not developed enough; the hints/allusions could have been a little more obvious. Time and space were also difficult keep track of when reading the story. The ending provides a climax that will force many to want to continue reading.

He had to keep it hidden for if the king found out about the dragon the king would want him captured and possibly killed.Some how the king found out about Eragon's dragon and sent his servantsthe Ra'zac after Eragon.

My mother is 47 and also enjoyed it thoroughly. The author does borrow from Tolkien as has been mentioned by other reviewers, but you can find that most other stories have been told before.Eragon is written wonderfully and you get very involved with the characters.(Tip: Isn't it interesting when you read critical reviews the writer hasn't even found the spell-check button on their computer?)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book is about a teenager named Eragon, who finds a dragon egg in a mountain range called the Spine. When the egg hatches he seeks help from a story teller named Brom and together they set out on a journey to Farthen Dur, a base for a rebellion. Along the way, Brom teaches Eragon magic and soon he has a dream about a girl in a prison and they decide to rescue her on the way. There they meet some ranger guy who has a secret (Brom also has a secret). They rescue her and shes an elf and at this point the entire empire is after them...... really its a fine mixture of Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. You know: join rebellion, destroy evil, find out your some chosen one. It's a very action packed suspenseful donut with a surprise filling that will fatten and please your brain. I definately recommend this book to anybody over 10 years old."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I borrowed Eragon from the library, and I loved it!

As I read the jacket I was drawn to all things that make my reading of fantasy a joy. An amazing story. I will be looking for Paolini in the new book section along with my other writers. Having lived in Montana for a few years, it is good to see that Montana has as many surprises as it appears Christopher has in store.

The series is AWESOME and I love it. It has the epicness of LOTR, without being boring and somewhat childish. I'm not bashing LOTR, by any means but I always felt that LOTR was a story written on a grand scale but with descriptions and words and characters to appeal to young children, while the Inheritance Cycle still has the appeal for children and is very epic, its not like Harry Potter, with jumping chocolate frogs (HP is my fav series ever so, i'm not bashing it either)and LOTR with the character humor. Inheritance is similar to LOTR and Dragon Riders of Pern, but I believe that it is better then the two, in the sense that it gets right to the point, in action, characters and style. Though descriptions can be very, very lenghty at times, you always can invision what is being described to you as a great visiual aide."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great book full of adventure when I read it I feel like I'm a character in the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Negatives: Lots of rough little spots, with changes in pacing, some icky sentences, bad dialogue and such. Actually, the very first sentence is one of the worst in the entire book. The plot is hardly original and the characters, while very likable, don't have much to offer that isn't predictable. There's a bit of speechifying and over-drama to a few parts.Pluses: The rough little spots mentioned above don't detract much from the overall story, because they really are little. The plotting is, for the most part, tight and well-crafted chapter by chapter. The relationships between characters are very satisfying, especially between the main two characters(which is anything but common in epic fantasy). The system of magic is handled fairly well, especially considering how overwhelming it might have been. The locations all have something unique, and so, seem to take on small lives of their own. The book as a whole has heart to it, real heart, with believably common conflicts as well as the larger ones, an impressive attention to detail without often over-stepping, and lots of creativity in the layers past the main plot. Eragon is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love this series! It is a wonderful story that helps us all find the hero within.

First one is this: It is good, people tell its good, and then it gets alot of attention and fans. This is the way for Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it was a good novel with an amazing plotline.Eragon, by Christopher Paolini uses the different approach.Hype. Lots of Hype. For it was self published, for it was written by a teenager. It's obvious it was self published. It was written badly and there was alot of errors. The plot was copied, I doubt anyone wanted to publish it.'And wow, it's written by a teenager'. That doesn't mean it will be amazing. I'd like to see what Paloni publishes in a few years, but right now I'm edging away from Eragon and its sequel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Come on! Each and everyone of us who loved Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Steven KIng's Dark Tower has one time or another WISHED he/she could write something like that. Mostly in our teens. And thats what happened to Paolini. But most of us understand what a cheap copy of plagiarism this would be. I am just very dissapointed that while the rest of us try to come up with something unique to add to the fantasy genre, some immature wisegyus get to make money out of what everyone could do....cheaply copy out great works of art and shame them in doing so!I just wonder how much he paid Anne McCaffrey to have permition to write about Dragon-Riders and something very similar to a Weyr, while everyone else is threatened with a law-suit by even mentioning the above.Ps: When i read about Gil'ead (copied from the Dark Tower)i rolled on the floor laughing. At least Salvatore and Robert Jordan came up with some different names when ripping off Middle Earth....."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I know, I know. I'm supossed to \\"suspend disbelief\\" when I read fantasy and I really tried for this book. But suspension of disbelief can only go so far. I can't believe that Eragon can fight so well with broken ribs or that he can become a master swordsman in a few months. Nor can I believe that Saphira can be so wise and motherly when she spent the past few centuries in an eggshell. It's these impossibilities that make the characters seem unreal and kill any connection I could have felt for them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I give huge kudos to Mr. Paolini for writing and publishing this book at age 16. When most people his age are caught up in acne, cliques, and the opposite sex, he has shown the fortitude, talent and incredible patience required to complete a novel. (Which for those of you who have never tried to write a nove...it is a Herculian task in the first place.)With all that said, Mr. Paolini's book, while good and worthwhile for you to PURCHASE, is not the second coming of Tolkien (then again who is?). While he does manage to spin an interesting tale full Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, mentors, wizards, shades, etc...his actual writing suffers from being slightly inconsistant. The motivation of his characters sometime seem somewhat forced upon them rather than developing organically. I also felt occasionally rushed in on way or the other rather in terms of plot as well.The novel also suffers from the derivitive nature of the world he has chosen to create. For those of us who have read a lot of Fantasy novels...his world is perhaps just a bit too close to other novels we have read. (Specifically the Dragon Riders of Pern books by Anne McCaffery and perhaps a bit from The Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan.) Granted it is hard to come up with anything completely \\"new\\" but in retrospect it would be nice to have seen Mr. Paolini stretch a bit more and really put more of a definitive stamp on his world. (Sherri Tepper is a brillian example of an author who creates worlds unlike any other. Grass, Raising of the Stones, and Plague of Angels are great examples.)For those who do not read much Fantasy, I suspect this book will be a nice introduction to the the genre. For those Fantasy junkies...it is a good and worthwhile read. (4 stars or 7.5 out of 10). I will say this...I look forward to Mr. Paolini's development as a writer and suspect his pen will be come sharper and more distinct as the years go by. I wish him much luck and good fortune...now get the sequal out already. :)For those of you looking for other worthwhile Fantasy reads, might I suggest the following authors.1. Tolkien (duh!)2. George R. R. Martin (Game of Thrones, etc)3. Peirs Anthony (Split Infinity and early Xanth novels)4. Micheal Ende (The Neverending Story - 10x better than the movie, and the movie wasn't bad.)5. Sherri S. Tepper (Grass, and Raising of the Stones)6. J.K. Rowlings (Harry Potter - The movies don't do them justice)7. Philip Pullman (Golden Compass, etc)8. Orson Scott Card (Seventh son, etc)9. Terry Brooks (Shanara Series...although Wishsong is the ultimate gem.)10. C.S. Lewis (Narnia Chronicles)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you're smart enough to know how to read, this book is not worth your time.A man from an old order of knights goes bad, kills all the other knights and forms an Empire. A few years later a farmboy gets a message from a princess who's been captured by said empire and decides to save her. He manages to find one of the last knights from the old order who then trains him. Oh, and by the way the kid is one of the special people who has a special power. Ends up that when he's done with his training his parents are dead. Later on that old knight dies to save his life. He goes on to find a rebel base. You'd think I'm describing Star Wars, right?No. Sadly, I'm describing this book. Replace the force with dragons and the scenery with the Lord of the Rings landscape and you have a theft of a classic in action--and poorly done theft at that. There's no emotion for the characters. It feels exactly how it would if a child wrote a story after watching Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.Truth is that a teen did write it, but that is NO excuse for the poor makeup of this story. If you're interested in a good book, keep looking. I had to force myself to finish this, and I'm sorry I did."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Righto, first off, I've heard alot of criticisms for this work, and would like to point something out.There ARE similarities between this and, say, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Fans of Eragon sometimes don't want to admit this, but it's true. That said, this isn't the most serious or original work that has been written over the past decade. Nevertheless, Paolini's book does present quite enough engaging characters and plot lines that it still is fun to read.The bottom line is, no art isn't affected by previous works. Several people have said that Paolini copies Tolkien, yet Paolini says Tolkien is one of his greatest influences...influence IS different from plagerism.In conclusion, while I found that some of this seemed familiar, it was fresh enough to engage me. It moves at a good pace, is easy to read and comprehend, and has a good ending. I think it's well worth a read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"With the movie coming out I'm sure plenty of people will want to read it, so here's my advice: check it out of the library, PARTICULARLY if you are a grown person (note how many of the glowing reviews were written by tweens and teens). Then if it turns you on, buy a copy, or buy Eldest.Why I gave this book three stars instead of four:- The plot was entirely, disappointingly, slavishly derivative, particularly to anyone familiar with Star Wars. The similarities have been well documented in other reviews, and they will be painfully obvious to anyone familiar with the works borrowed from. About the only thing I didn't know before Eragon left Carvahall was where Eragon would stop and Eldest would begin. I have already guessed what's going to happen to all the major characters in the story's conclusion, and I'm willing to bet I'm at least 80% right. [...]- The writing is for the most part direct and serviceable, by which I mean it makes sense grammatically and gets the point across without meandering too far, but it is not particularly fun to read. To me, there is no story so compelling that it doesn't need to be well told, and this is where Paolini really falls down. At worst, his writing is stilted, pretentious and heavy-handed. (Any time I see \\"smote\\" instead of \\"struck,\\" I know I'm in for it.)- Too many of the major characters, good and bad, are male.- Paolini goes to a lot of trouble to invent a universe and languages, and then he populates it with...immortal elves, dragons, orcs (I mean urgals), dwarves, and humans. Worse, he lifts the human society wholesale from Anglo Saxon England, with all its suffocating patriarchy and ignorance, rather than creating a new one to go with his new world. He's certainly not alone in that, but that doesn't make it any less disappointing.Why I gave this book three stars instead of one or two:-Alagaesia is a fully imagined alternate universe, with cities and geography and politics and individuals with more or less carefully crafted backstories.-There are at least some strong female characters.-The ra'zac are wonderfully hideous and terrifying.But Paolini has a long way to go before he approaches the level of Garth Nix, Neil Gaiman, or Philip Pullman (and longer still before he approaches LeGuin or Tolkein)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini definitely puts forward a so-so performance in Eragon. in one hand, it is relatively engaging and easy to read. It is by no means high literature, but as a leisure book, Eragon is fun. That said, there are ceveral problems with the book. First of all is the names - the exotic and often misused letter punctuation is irritating and gives the book a contrived feel, as many of these marks are unnessecary. The storyline is nearly just out of Star Wars, upon examination (A farm boy is taught of his true destiny by an old mentor who is later killed by the enemy, and he must help to take down a tyrannical emperor). The races are nearly just out of Tolkien (The elves are forest symbiotic, long lived, strong warriors who may or may not get involved with the fighting and came to this land from over seas, the dwarves live in underground cities, and are short and gruff, and the humans won't unite). these methods are tried and true, but getting tired, and while Eragon is a fun quick read, it by no means deserves the acclaim it gets."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is by far the best book I've ever read! I reccomend it to everybody, whether you're 10 or 110! The detail is great, and it is very suspenseful! You feel like you're there more than any other fantasy book I know of, and you can see in your mind what the characters look like very clearly. And not only is Eragon well written, but it also has a very cool plot which is more interesting and fun to read than the plots of other fantasy books like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. The names may be hard to say, but there's a pronunciation guide in the back. And the locations are easy to remember, but there's a map on the front page just in case.I couldn't put this book down for a second after I picked it up, and I finished it in a day despite its being 500+ pages! I've reccomended it to my friends, who are reading it now and love it just as much as I do, so don't think I'm the only one who is this crazy about it!

It lacks nothing.This book tells the amazing adventure of Eragon, a boy who suddenly has the fate of the land of Alagaesia fall into his own hands. It tells of his amazing journey through this unique and wonderful land, which has been largely corrupted by an evil king.This book, and it's sequel, \\"Eldest\\", are some of the best books out there.

I like to know something about ANY author who gets teenage boys to read. Paolini has succeeded wildly here, so kudos on that regard. I do hope those boys will then seek out the more original works (listed in detail elsewhere) upon which \\"Eragon\\" is so obviously based. But even if they don't, if they continue to read Paolini's other works, then more power to the young author!Truly, though, this is a story to get involved in just for a light adventure, though I hope the later books will show more originality and character development."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"perfect medieval story in every way. there were no let down and i wouldnt change a single letter."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a book is great and I belive that all the fans of this kind of tale wont regret it.

(Or perhaps I've played too much Spyro as a kid, who knows? :P)Anyways, I've bought it and I started to read it, and I finshed it in three days, and mind you that is very quik for me.The story made me think of Tolkiens work a little bit. The way Christopher describes the enviroments and all was really good, I envisioned it in my mind and it was gorgeous. As I read the story it was played in my head like a movie, and it didnt cost me any effort envision this movie in my head. Only a book that is fast-paced, well written and intruiging can do that to me.It's a great book, if you like fantasy fiction and love dragons and like Tolkiens work, you oughta try this book out.

Especially since it was written by a 17 year old as a hobby in high school, as something to do when he was bored. It is excellent. How he writes it it becomes real, and your part of it. A boy and his dragon, dragon riders, elves and dwarfs and magic and more, a classic AWESOME book that you could read for hours. Its like right up there with harry potter, except more people love harry potter (encluding me) becaouse theres more books and movies, etc. but once that 7th book is out for a month BAM its gonna be eragon for the next 7 years.

It is a different book! The story is completely different and has a much greater resemblance to Star Wars than it does LOTR. The use and definition of \\"magic\\" is the most obvious difference between Eragon and The Lord of the Rings, and anyone who knows anything about LOTR would know this. In Eragon, magic is a palpable, outwardly manipulated thing. In LOTR it is subtle... I can't explain it. Read both books and A. You are a complete and utter moron or B. The differences will be completely obvious.Eragon was a solid and enjoyable book and I am eagerly anticipating the sequel. It was well-written and fast-paced and drew me into a rich, complete, and cleverly spun world. The book would be five stars if not for the obvious parallels with Star Wars. No big.

Yes, he borrows strongly from Tolkien, but my overall impression was of a young Tolkien testing his wings. Given time, Paolini will mature into a more original author and earn his acclaim. He has the talent, the skill, and now the support, eventually he'll find his way.Chris - read Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne, H G Wells, or better yet, Homer's Odyssey.

However, this \\"review\\" is actually directed at all the ignorant people here that have the audacity to claim that Mr. Tolkien created Elves, Dwarves and Dragons. That claim couldn't be more incorrect and ridiculous. Elves and Dwarves are originally from Norse Mythology. And Dragons have been around for thousands of years!To assure myself of this, I did a little research and what I found was truly shocking. I have learned that Mr. Tolkien COPIED the names Gandalf (the protagonist of his epic story) and Middle-Earth (the setting of his world) from Norse Mythology. So in turn, anybody has the right to \\"use\\" Elves or Dwarves in their work as much as anybody else.I am not defending Mr. Paolini. I agree with the notion that he should develop his own material and refrain from further derivation of other fantasy novels. However, I do defend him in the sense that anybody can use Elves and Dwarves. Trust me he's not the only one. Below, I have provided two paragraphs which I cut and pasted from a Norse Mythology site which clearly states Mr. Tolkien took ideas from Norse Mythology and used it for his work.In conclusion you people really need to wake up and get a grip. Mr. Tolkien was great, but he's not the fantasy novel god here. People shouldn't be compared to him in everything regarding fantasy. My advice to you is just enjoy fantasy to its fullest. Have a nice day.Cut and Pasted Material Below:\\"Many people are familiar with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelung, but they are not familiar with Norse mythology to which both of these works are heavily indebted.Tolkien was very well acquainted with Norse mythology, as can be seen by the use of it in his books. The name of one of his main characters, Gandalf, is found in The Poetic Edda. Gandalf is, in some ways, reminiscent of Odin, the leader of the Norse pantheon. Even the name Middle-earth, the setting for Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, comes from Norse mythology.\\" (...)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The exposition of our story begins with a princess fleeing the servants of the evil empire.

Yes, it is impressive that the author wrote the book at such an early age. As it stands, though, the book is little more than a (very) rough draft. It is also very derivative and unintentionally humorous, as other reviewers have noted. The narrative structure is generally poor, as are also some of the author's techniques: frequently spelling out the protagonist's thoughts, providing history lessons via a storyteller without song, or assigning names to places from some fictitious language without actually developing that language (better to assign descriptive or evocative names in English, then). If I had read this book when I was a kid, I might have overlooked some of these problems and enjoyed it nonetheless. Probably, many kids are doing that now. However, the book will definitely have very limited appeal for adults who have a taste for well-crafted, original fantasy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I'd like to apologize for my earlier review(s)....If you happen to have read it, you may know why...I just began rereading Eragon is anticipation of the sequel, which I still plan to get. The knowledge for my previous review was written on the thoughts I held three years ago, when Eragon first came out.Now, I still stand by what I said. A book is meant to be read and enjoyed, and that SOME reviewers--SOME mind you---seem to have forgotten that and were, perhaps because the author was young, bending over the book with a magnifiying glass, looking for flaws to point out....some of those flaws, my reread proved, you could look through the wrong end of a binocular and still see.....But first to those microscope flaws....the ones that reviewers put down in their reviews for whatever reason may grip them. The lack of the use 'said' was a popular microscope flaw a few months ago (don't ask me how I know). I can go find you several times when the word said is used, but is it really that big of a deal? PLEASE. Spare me if you put the book aside simmply becuase there is variety in the dialogue........good point. Varierty=good.Oh, yes, the rip offs.....they are much worse than I remember, and I am not just saying that. They are bad, and obvious. You already know the victims of this crime. I will say that just because there are elves and dwarves is not a reason for you to skip this book. I can go find ten authors with elves and dwarves in their works. The actual rip offs, the ugly ones, come from Anne McCaffery, LeGuin, Tolkien still, and Star Wars.....The Star Wars, with some control, can be overlooked. It's a common enough plot now, and it is simply a bad rip off. Tolkien had lost his Gandalf, his setting, his Nazgul, and his portrayal of the orcs....and of course, the elves and the dwarves. Anne McCaffery lost her Dragonriders.....this was the really ugly rip off. I love Anne McCaffery's works, and to see her stuff come in Eragon, like never before, was nearly heart breaking. It is one of the reasons I apologize so much...I had forgotten just how much my favorite authors are stolen and beaten and left to lie in a ditch.The worst rip off of all in Eragon is LeGuin. If you haven't read her books, you need to, but Paolini rips off her theory of magic hands down, no excuses. If Paolini had just tried to make it is own, turn something around, make it a little different, it would have been better. Sadly, he did not. Rip offs=ugly....The rip offs were the other-end-of-binocular flaws....but there are more. Simply reading the book, you can read the words \\"electrified\\", for instance. It gives you a nice mental picture, but far as I know, electricity doesn't exist in a Tolkien-ish world.The dialogue is bad, I know. Enough said on that...The writing is bad, I know...Now, let me see if I can climb out of the hole I just wrote myself into. How is Dragon Quill going to get out of this one? with \\"U R just jealous?\\" I think not...I think I'll go back to my metaphor of a car.Yes, a car. Eragon is not a 'hotrod\\" of fantasy. It does not tear up the road, leaving all other fantasy books in the dust. Paolini takes the freeway where most authors take the backroads of creativity and originality. Eragon is \\"pooper jones\\", who goes 55 miles an hour when he's not pulling a trailer. Eragon is not the skinning motorcycle that can squeeze through gaps in traffic, it simnply has to wait.Yet Eragon is still fully functional. We may not have a Mustang Convertible, or a snazzy sports car, or a jazzy hotrod, but a reader can still get quite a ride, if they don't mind the dirty oil that are cliches, the vinal seats that are the characters, the over-sized wheels that are the rip offs, the stick-shiftness of the writing.Yet who am I kidding? Eragon needs an Overhaulin'....lets hope that Eldest takes us up on that....Until then..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Good things first, since I feel like being generous and caring. This book has its issues, yes, but here are someone things to help your decision on why to buy this book. After all, we aren't here to debate if Eragon should have been published or not.Good item number one: This book reads fast, despite its size.Good item number two: Many kids, with the number of young authors falling daily, will find this book inspiring. After all, it was written by a fifteen year old peer.Good item number three: Some kids (please excuse the following information as coming from another person) do not have the attention spans to sit and read through the Lord of the Rings. They're intimidating books to someone whose just out of chapter books.Good item number four: It was interesting; I finished it in two days. Why I gave it two stars comes next.Bad items, yes, there are many. Here's how to use this review. If the above four outway the following one, two, three, four, five......etc.....then buy this book. I'm pretty sure most kids under 12 will enjoy this book.Bad item number uno: Characters aren't nearly as devloped and captivating as most teens (Paolini's target age group) like to see. Personally, I really only cared for the dragon.Bad item number two: Relatively classic plot and execution. Left with nice plot holes to be patched poorly later.....sorry, lost the neutrality. Yes, there are some gaping holes in this book that should have been resolved more before publication.Bad item number three: The emotions characters should leak out of you is absent. in other words, if something happened to a character, I couldn't care less. If the world came to be ruled by the evil person, I could not care less.Bad item number four(corresponds with bad item number three): The author needs to do less telling, more showing...... The reason I couldn't care less is because I'm given no reason to fear or dread the stereotypical evil person. I'm only given the anger and hatred of the 'good guys', who i really don't care for, so again, I couldn't care less.Bad item number five: author trys to sound like an expert on war and battle, swords and weapons. By trying to give too much detail in cities defenses and battlements, armor, and weapons, in attempt, of course, to make it sound believable, the author does the opposite. He 'reveals his weaknesses' too much. I'm not expecting Paolini to be an expert, but he shouldn't act or pertend to be one. Writer to writer (yes, I write) Paolini, find your strengths and use them. Avoid the weaknesses, but not too much.Bad item number six: author likes to repeat phrases over an over again. Several times I read: a (scream, cry) tore from (his, her) lips. It is a nice phrase, yes, but it suffers from overuse.Bad item number seven: unlike bad item number six, author, in trying to show off his ability, UNDER uses the word said. Yes, that was a petty number seven, but it gets worse. Some of those substited words should be used sparringly, but aren't. Also, many of the alternates don't seem to fit in with the dialogue. It is okay to use said. As a writer, I limit my words to said, whisper, murmur, mutter, and exclaimed. You might never come across a 'banter' or 'barked' in any work of mine. (Except the previous sentence, of course)Bad item number eight: There are a LOT of rip offs in the story. Take Lord of the Rings setting, combine with Star Wars plot, add Dragonriders of Pern characters. Garnish with doxens of other works. No baking necessary, things don't need to blend. Congrats, you've just made Eragon all over again.Bad item number nine: Things are a little too convenient for the main character. He always gets saved after he faints or gets knoced out. I don't know if this is supposed to be a \\"Alagaesia's hero is a kind of a loser who hasn't stayed awake to see the end of a fight\\" but it does get annoying.Bad reason item ten: Ah, yes, one of my favorite bad items. This book is written in third-person limited. That POV doesn't allow for things from OUR world, Earth, to creep in. I do not think Alagaesia would have seen a mummy, much less know how one unravels........Bad item number eleven:I'll make this the final one. A major plot hole that keeps nagging at me. 1) dragon scales are ,emtioned to me as solid as armor, yet an arrow peirces it and goes straight to the dragon's heart, killing it. 2) dragons are mentioned to be full grown, later they are mentioned to never stop growing. Editing, bad job on that one....Yes, there you have it. If you couldn't care less about the bad items, or they are outweighed, go buy this book, though I say try the paperback version, it would be a better buy. If you're about even, go check it out from our local library or borrow it from a friend. If you are appalled by the bad items, turn away and run, there are better books to buy, and you're wasting your time reading all these reviews....."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For those who are in a hurry, here is a brief summary of the plot of Eragon: Blah Blah Blah Blah...Eragon is knocked unconscious...Zzzz Zzzz Zzzz...Eragon wakes up...Blah Blah Blah. And the process is repeated over and over again. Sounds like a real international best-seller doesn't it? Yeah Right! I have read more interesting TV Guides. This book goes to show that if you put a nice shiny cover on a copy of the instrution manual of a toaster, you could be a best-selling author.Something I noticed in this book was that it was extremely hard to get a mental picture of the way something looked. For example, the city of Tronjheim kept reforming itself in my mind because I could never quite understand its layout. It was quite impossible to imagine what any of the characters really looked like, and this severed any connection you might have with them.Eragon's motives kept changing. He never seemed to know quite what he was going to do. Sometimes the reader got the feeling that Paolini was just making it up as he went, because some things are kind of unexplained. One time, their group, consisting of a dragon and two highly capable fighters, is attacked by Urgals. Eragon is of course immediatley knocked out and wakes up alone in a cell. The dragon and his companion, however, are free. What happended to them? Why weren't they captured as well? Why couldn't they stop him from being captured? It never says. As for the motives, in the beginning, his whole life is centered around killing the Ra'zac. Then, as soon as he finds them, he decides to not fight them. There was also potential for some real action in this part of the book, where Eragon and Brom thought they were going to have to switch themselves with two slaves whose job was to bring offerings to an odd rock structure where Eragon believed the Ra'zac lived. The slaves generally never returned. But instead Paolini decided to have the Ra'zac come to Eragon, thereby abandoning what could have been a very exciting part. Instead of finishing them off, Eragon just started traveling again. Another example of the author's indecision on what was going to happen next is demonstrated by a time when they, after a long commute, were going to talk to a fellow named Dromnad. Never happended. Instead, another course of action was taken. It is like Paolini is leading the reader through a maze, but takes him to all the dead ends before going the right way. Just as you would not want to be led through a maze in this way, so to is it discouraging to read this book.Another point of dislike is the ending. The reader at least expects a confrontation with the Ra'zac, the baddies who started the whole book. But instead, it's a Shade, who's history we find out the second before he's killed. This brief history lesson feels very out of place, as if it was squeezed in at the last second. If the author really wanted to give us a biography of the Shade, he should have inserted it throughout the book, because it appears to be an attempt to make us care about the Shade. It was really not necesary though.Then there's the character that is introduced in the last two pages. What the heck? I understand this book will have a sequel, but it should have some finality to it. Instead of invoking anticipation for the next book, it just leaves you with a confused and annoyed feeling. Not a good way to entice readers to buy the next book. Included after this not-so-amazing ending is a language guide. This is a ploy of Paolini's, trying to convince you he actually created a whole language on his own. To do so would require a college degree and the amount of years Paolini had been on this Earth when he wrote the book. It is a misconception to think he created a whole language.So anyway, if you like indecisive plotting, little action, fuzzy characters and settings, and bad endings, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, this story has been told at least a hundred times and the writing is downright flat and unimaginative. Do not confuse this with what real fantasy should be. Try George R. R. Martin, Tad Williams or Robin Hobbs to name a few of the fantasy masters that can tell a story with originality and readability. This book had nothing to motivate me to finish it or even care how it ends. A good fantasy book should be a treat to read and should draw you into the story wishing it would never end. This book does not. My advice to Mr. Paolini: Get some fresh material and than maybe you'll earn the respect of hardcore fantasy readers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon has two things going for it:1) The cover.

As far as a Paolini Haters club, I don't think there is one, but there probably should be dozens of them. My friends hate this book. I hate this book. We hate it for the same reason it's really really really really really really bad. Sometimes the truth hurts but it's good so many people have finally realized Eragon sucks!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a high school sophomore and I tried reading Eragon this year after many of my friends highly recommended it, and one asked to borrow the copy my parents had given me much earlier. Despite the praise, I was sorely disappointed.Any time spent reading Eragon is time better spent doing almost anything else. The flaws in it are characterized by the fact that it was written by a teenage boy. The writing, for example, in additional to being horrid, puts on tremendous airs [like teenage boys, often]; the text is littered with questionable usages of large, obscure words. The passages in which Paolini tries to give his book some deeper meaning are painful to read, because of the irrelevance and, frankly, the stupidity of the \\"moral issues\\" he tries to address; it is clear that some passages were inserted solely for the purpose of trying to make the book \\"deep\\" (unsuccessfully). As people have said, every character, every situation, and every aspect of the book are copied inexpertly from existing, exponentially better works of fantasy/science fiction. His 'acknowledgements' at the end were irritatingly insolent, with the author thanking everyone he knew and who helped him publish his book, even thanking his characters, and specifically neglecting to acknowledge all of the plot twists, characters, settings, and other ideas, blatantly stolen from more experienced fantasy authors. Everything the author tries to imitate is seen in Eragon in despicable, half-hearted shadow. The languages Paolini creates are clearly a gimmick to amuse Tolkein fans, not created out of a genuine love of linguistics as were those of the latter master author.At times the plot was action-packed enough to keep one engrossed in reading, but that was just frustrating to me, since it obligated me to keep reading this awful book in order to find out what happened. Looking back on it, however, all of the characters were so bland and distant that it's hard for me to believe that I actually cared what happened to them.Still, I would not even recommend the book to people who would only care about the plot. The plot of the book was not worth the time spent reading 500 pages. The storyline had a consistent, irritating pattern: the heroes would have a problem, they would spend a while trying to come up with a solution, eventually some sort of solution would suddenly appear out of nowhere, the characters would travel for a while until they met another problem and the same thing happened. Despite this annoying suddenness of the solutions, the problems were equally annoyingly foreshadowed, making half the plot boringly predictable, while the other half was confusingly random. Sometimes it seemed like maybe the story had made more sense when it was in the author's head. At risk of appearing harsh, I say, the author's head is probably where this story should have stayed, until he matured in writing and otherwise."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"*sighs* I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book. Many reviewers praise 'Eragon' because the author wrote it when he was 15. Big deal. Personally, I would treat Paolini like any other author. If an older author had written this, they would've gotten much lower reviews. \\"Buy hey! This guys just a kid! Ordinary rules don't apply to him!\\"This book was very annoying in places. Paolini gives you monstrous details and descriptions of unimportant parts of the story, but doesn't once describe the main character's appearance. I think Paolini attempted to make Eragon modeled after himself. Sad.The stereotypes in 'Eragon' are obvious to a good reader. The main character is a Dragon-Rider, and somehow manages to become a master swordsman, wizard, and hero in about 5 pages. He enjoys drinking, whining, and often cries and faints. I find it astonishing that Eragon managed to trick the very evil and intelligent 'Shade', when he doesn't even know how to read.Kids may enjoy this book, because it is easy to read, but I don't recomend it to anyone over 11. If you have any idea what a great fantasy book really is, and have read Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, you will simply hate this book for lack of originality, an over-used plot, and many grammer errors. If Tolkien was still living, I seriously doubt he would appreciate wannabe authors ripping off his ideas.I'd probably give this book negative-1zillion stars, but sadly, a 'zillion' is not a real number. But I shall make it a real number NOW!! A 'zillion' is now ten-million trillions, and a 'gazillion' is a trillion-zillions.

Without a sequel to turn through, I read through of the Harry Potter and forgot all about this book. This year, I came back to the sequel, Eldest, and couldn't force myself past two chapters before I became bored and returned it.What am I saying? To be to the point:-The book is great if you haven't experienced the genius of Rowling or require books that are lower on the intellectual scale.-I immediately missed the wide and strong vocabulary and structure of the Harry Potter series, Stephen King's masterpieces and the like.-After reading good books, I couldn't make myself read this one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"i absolutely loved this book :) i couldnt stop turning the pages and i loved the storyline as well, the beginning was ok but it got ALOT better, paolini did a great job developing the characters and the plot. the only thing i didnt like was that there were so many characters and places that it started getting a bit confusing, especially since most of the places were in the ancient language but the xray feature really helped me remember. overall i really loved it and cant wait to read eldest!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was looking forward to this after being told by a few people how great it was. Three of those were my own teenage kids, and the other was someone who hasn't read much Fantasy. I even waited until the third one came out before starting, so that I could go through the whole series.Unfortunately, after forcing myself to finish the first book, I won't be bothering with the rest. As others have said, it is very same-ish to a lot of much-better books out there. The writing is good for a 15 year old, I suppose, but nothing special. In fact it is a little tedious. At the end of the book, I couldn't even bring myself to have any empathy for any of the characters. I didn't especially like Eragon, or Saphira (who I found very dull). And the villains aren't especially noteworthy either. Worse is that there wasn't a single original idea in the book. It really was a chore to read.Sorry. I wanted to like it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Don't pay attention to the bad reviews. This book is good. You may say he copied things from other amazing authors, but technically, he didn't. Everybody knows that a plot like this should always start in the countryside. If you didn't, now you do. Plus, we should be able to get good ideas like this from good authors, no matter how similar they may seem. Seriously, all he really copied was the small stuff. And, this book is NOT predictable. Go ahead, guess. Whatever you thought of was probably wrong. Trust me, I should know. I've read the whole series, including Inheritance. I knew about the similaries and was still surprised. The movie itself has you on a wild goose chase. But seriously, read this book. If you like Harry Potter, swordfighting, and/or similar, this is another book for you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The main problem with eragon was that there was not one original idea in it. It simply reorganized an assortment of overly used cliched ideas whilst still trying to get a shock value from something you saw coming since the first 10 pages. Christopher Paolini is also sadly not a very good writer. I see many people giving credit saying the only reason he is a bad writer is because was a teenager at the time he wrote this. Well so am I!! I am around the same age as Paolini was when he wrote this book and yet I am perfectly capable at recognizing bad writing! So I don't believe he deserves a cop out simply for his age. There is also no character development problem out side of eragon and saphira, and the most intresting characters Angela, arya, brom, and murtagh are Completly ignored with complete lack of effort even though there were plenty of oppurtunities to flesh them out! The story tended to drag on which is hard for me to say because I love big books I can read all the Harry potters in a week! I have read many fantasy books and this just seems like a Lord of the Rings knock gone wrong. But to give the author credit the 2 characters he bothered to develope I truly loved such as eragon and saphira and nasuada so I will read the next books to find out what happens."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Of all the many reviews on this book, it needs to be restated that the main plot line looks like a fantasy reworking of Star Wars.

My pleasure was diminished, however, by repeated discovery of close parallels with the characters and storyline of Star Wars. These similarities are so striking that I'm quite shocked that no other review mentions them.Some examples follow (skip if you don't want plot details given away):Orphaned farmboy Eragon (Luke Skywalker) is compelled to flee when his uncle's farm is destroyed by bad guys sent by the evil Empire. He's befriended and trained by a former member (Brom => Obiwan Kenobi) of an ancient society (Dragon Riders => Jedi Knights) of elite warriors that kept order until it was destroyed by a talented new member (Galbatorix => Annakin Skywalker). He has a vision of a beautiful woman (Arya => Princess Leia) in a prison cell and rescues her. Along the way, he is befriended by a tough guy who is friend to neither Empire nor rebels (Murtagh => Han Solo) who nevertheless accompanies him to the Varden (=> Rebel) base and helps repel the inevitable Empire attack. Our hero kills the Darth-like figure Durza to save the rebels.Mr. Paolini is a talented writer, but he needs to learn the difference between \\"inspired by\\" and \\"adapted from\\"."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I should have checked the reviews before buying based on a friend's recommendation. The ratings skew high, but all the most-helpful reviews are one or two stars: a telling sign.(I'm really shocked at all the five-star reviews. Have these people not read anything original, ever?)Let's see what this has to offer, plot-wise [spoilers, if you can call it that]:Orphan protagonist who doesn't know his parentage? Check.Tragic murder of protagonist's father-figure? Check.Wise old mentor? Check. Who dies in protagonist's arms? Check.Tolkien-clone elves and dwarves? Check. Invented languages? Check.Protagonist saved from certain doom at the hands of evil forces by deus ex machina? Check, check, check, check, check. (Yes: that repeatedly. It's like this is the only plot device the author knew.)Protagonist captured by evil forces, but freed by even more unlikely rescuers? Check, check. (A slight variation on the theme.)Then you add in the dozens of internal inconsistencies (dragons as large as hills somehow wiped out by 13 evil knight/wizards in the space of about forty years; 12 of the 13 evil knights killed \\"mostly\\" by at best semi-competent rebels in the next forty; chief evil bad guy needs protagonist because with \\"one more\\" by his side he would be unstoppable... this is the tip of the iceberg) and you've barely recovered from the last insult to your intelligence before the next one knocks you reeling.The quality of the writing and dialog is as poor as I can remember. Everyone is angry or impatient with everyone else, and this is told us rather than shown. New York Times bestseller? Seriously?I was stuck on an airplane so I finished it more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. Belatedly, I now find it is famous more for its authors age at the time of writing than from any merits of its own; sort of a \\"It's not that the dog talks well, but that it talks at all\\" kind of thing. Give it a miss."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Have you ever read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"?

Sometimes I have to ignore bad reviews because most every book has them. Well this book was a huge disappointment. The use of a thesaurus is so obvious that it makes me feel embarrassed. If you've ever seen that episode of \\"Friends\\" when Joey writes a recommendation letter for Monica and Chandler to adopt a baby, and every single word in his letter came from the thesaurus, THAT is was I was reminded of reading Eragon LOL. Besides that, the characters are worthless and the story is just not interesting at all. And like everyone else has said, none of it is original. There's no need to explain it all since it has been done plenty of times here. I just had to review it to give it 1 star."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The story is enjoyable enough in a skim-through, don't-pay-too-much-attention, don't-think-too-hard sort of way. Yes, it is extremely derivative of older and much better literature. But IMHO the real problem is the awkwardness of the prose. I can forgive a lot of literary thievery, if it is done with grace, but grace is sadly lacking here. This book reads as though it was written by a teenager -- guess why.Paolini needs to mature, go to college, see the world, and take some creative writing courses. Unfortunately, his current success may convince him that he doesn't need to improve. And that would be a shame."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Readers of established fantasy can skip this one, as mentioned in other reviews. As an introduction to the genre, I'd much rather see a new reader steered in the direction of an established author, as this series would be a mediocre start.I first intended to review Eragon without having read the second book, but it became necessary as the second book is significantly different from, and better than, the first. My unorthodox suggestion is for you to skip Eragon and go right to Eldest - the summary of Eragon at the beginning of Eldest is much better than wading through the book itself, and you can always go back later and read it to find out about the Brom character and the hatching of Saphira if you are still interested by the end of Eldest.Having said that, here is my review of Eragon. My personal taste in fantasy is for a well-crafted epic and/or really new and different fantasy worlds peopled by interesting races, and at least one unforgettable character. I find Eragon to be an odd book to review; ultimately I approached it from two angles - that of a regular fantasy novel/start of a trilogy, and as the debut product of a very young author. From the fantasy viewpoint, it is an adequate but not original or memorable story, and readers of Tolkien, LeGuin, and Anne McCaffrey's dragon series will not find any surprises in the types of creatures or concepts that make up Alagaesia. However, this is an admirable first effort for a teenager who clearly possesses enthusiasm for his topic and a formidable vocabulary. At times it seems as if he's being paid to write by the word and wants to show how many he knows; but in this age of crumbling literacy I have to applaud his interest in writing and the English language. His author's note at the end is as interesting as the body of the book, as it gives you a nice glimpse of the mind/personality behind the narration. I would rate the effort a 4 out of 5 but the originality and execution of the story a 1 of 5, so I gave it two stars.My main two main problems are the lack of originality, and the character of Eragon. He is a little too good, too fast, at everything he learns or attempts, becoming the equal of, or surpassing, the best practitioners of swordsmanship and magic in the land - much to the stunned and profuse admiration of whoever is handy. That he is intended to be special is clear, but there's no particular aura of humility, craftiness or nobility that clings to him, and his rapid progress from poor illiterate farm boy to heroic prodigy is just a little too convenient. He doesn't even have much of a personality beyond being a cocky average teenager. If this is supposed to be part of his ultimate growth as a character, the author gives no hint that we are to take Eragon's exploits with a grain of salt and wait for him to grow up. By the end of the book he has avoided any sort of major character-forming hardship and gone right to being the center of everyone's hopes and attention, and after about half a year of time and at age 16, is apparently master of everything he touches. Aside from the mystery of Eragon's parentage (which will no doubt turn out to be impressive), the author attempts to justify Eragon's talents by explaining that those who become dragon riders are automatically better at everything than everyone else, but it doesn't really hold water.I also wish for a little more personality and a distinctly different/alien thought process from Saphira, who most of the time sounds like an indulgent human mother. She jumps incoherently between the wisdom of dragon race memory, caring protector and uppity teenager.The most intriguing character is Murtagh, and I look forward to his development. There are also strong characters among the Varda and Dwarves (Ajihad, Nesuada, Orik and Hrothgar in particular) who seem to have something to offer. I am hoping that Arya has a lot more dimension to be revealed, because at this point she just seems to be a generic strong, beautiful, fey elf maiden. We're told she is very important but for now I'm not quite quaking in her presence.The first 200 pages introduce the world of Alagaesia and the characters. Facts presented for the reader's benefit, and justification for decisions made, are divulged by a lot of awkward, methodical dialogue that slows down the narrative. After this, the action picks up and moves along. The long tedium of a carefully explained cross-country trek, with all hell exploding loose at the eleventh hour of the story is a bit jarring, and once again, Eragon's feats at the end of the book are just beyond belief. If one reads the first chapter of Eldest which is provided at the end of the book, the author somewhat back-peddles and deconstructs the prodigious achievement by indicating that it was accomplished \\"partly by luck\\".I had high expectations of Eragon, given the handsome presentation of the hardcover books and the outcry of fans about how bad the movie was (I have avoided seeing it until I could read it first). After reading the book, I have to conclude that either the movie was truly a disaster, or the fans were over-protective of the material.In a nutshell, if you are wavering on whether or not to read this book, see if the library has a copy before you buy it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was one of the the most unoriginal pieces of fiction I have ever read. Granted, it's pretty long great for a 17 yr. old, but it pales in comparison against the originals. About 1.3 way into reading this, I was wondering if I was reading a kid proof version of LOTR with dragons mixed in for fun.This book had the potential to be great, but it fell flat. The movie could have given the book some positives as well, but it was worse than the book and that's saying something.I know that if I tried to write an epic adventure story, I wouldn't be able to. At least mine would have better grammar and word choice.This book also bothered me because he made no effort to make the writing interesting. I like reading about the character's reactions and emotions. That improves the story vastly. I'd rather have chraracters that are alive in a bad plot instead of flat characters in an unoriginal story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recently bought the audio book version of this book as I like to knit or quilt while I listen. I love well-written books, and Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles have long been a favorite, though unavailable as audiobooks. Having listened to \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" each Harry Potter book, the Ian Rankin \\"Inspector Rebus\\" mysteries, the Elizabeth George \\"Inspector Lynley\\" mysteries, and \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" (by Susanna Clarke) as audiobooks too many times to count, I thought I'd try something new - Eragon. My sister raved about Eragon, and she was the person who convinced me to give Harry Potter a try several years ago. But in this case, I was very underwhelmed by the story and the writing. I listened to the first CD last night and I was so bored. When I listen to or read the writing of Dunnett, Tolkien, Rowling, Rankin, George, and Clarke, I feel they own the world they have created and I trust them to tell their stories in the best way possible. But Eragon is very hard to listen to - it feels very derivative, unoriginal. I am determined to plow on, but I predict that \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" will be back in the CD player soon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ugh...What can I say? The plotline is cliched and boring, the writing isn't memorable in the least, and yes, a lot of it is borrowed from other series.I think a lot of people give Eragon a good rating simply because the author is young--or at least, this influences their review. To tell the truth, I've seen 12-year-olds that write stories that are much more captivating and well-written, and original. They just never get 'em published, which is why a lot of adults are surprised to see a book with 'such good writing for someone his age'--they don't have enough basis for comparison.I don't want to sound like I'M being biased because of Paolini's young age, either (I'm several years younger than him, actually--13) :). Truly, it wouldn't make a difference if he was 5 or 50 to me. A bad book is a bad book... And, well, Eragon is a bad book.I didn't enjoy reading it at all."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is really just formula fantasy. There is nothing really new or original in this book. The language is stilted at times and forced. Similes are often \\"off.\\" The book is \\"unrealistic\\" at times - and by that I mean given its own frame of reference. For example, Eragon becomes a world class swordsman in a couple of months?! Saphira is depicted as a powerful dragon and displays this at times, yet cannot carry 3 people?! There are other little errors as well that just show the superficiality of the book; for example, the weather is described as cloudy then moments later, they are viewing the stars for navigation. Eragon himself is a superficial character: I never got to actually care what happens to him. I love fantasy so I read the entire book, but I have no interest in reading the subsequent books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was excellent. It's a mixture of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Harry Potter. Very exciting and fast paced.The movie was terrible. If you liked the movie then you will love the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, I have grown to become a fantasy fan, thanks to J. R. R. Tolkien and was interested in seeing the movie.Plot:Eragon lives in the mountains with his uncle and cousin until he finds a mysterious \\"stone\\". He quickly discovers this stone is an egg when it hatches to reveal a dragon he calls Saphira. However, Galbatorix's agents are searching for the egg. Eragon's uncle dies, and Eragon leaves his home with a mysterious storyteller, Brom, and his dragon, Saphira, for revenge. During their travels, Brom teaches Eragon about the legacy of an order called the Riders, they battle beings called \\"Urgals\\", and Eragon searches for his purpose.Good:I am impressed at the quality of this book (considering the age of the author). The pacing was pretty even and kept me on the edge of my seat in numerous places (the flight from Gil'read and the end battle are particularly intense). Paolini does a pretty good job of detailing a battle (instead of copping out and saying \\"and they battled\\" or some other gibberish) while not getting so locked into it that there are pages upon pages of detailed battle maneuvers, ripostes, parries, etc. Paolini also handles magic relatively well, although he brushes it off towards the end (you stop feeling Eragon using the magic and are instead told how he uses the magic).Eragon is a very dynamic character that I felt was real and authentic. Saphira was convincing as an intelligent dragon; Brom was a great mentor. I even liked Murtagh.Bad:Probably my biggest complaint with this book is what many others have complained about: how similar it is to predecessors. I have not yet had the chance to read any Anne McCaffrey's books, but I have read Lord of the Rings and many of the Star Wars books, and the similarities are obvious.Elves, dragons, dwarves and the like are commonplace in fantasy. That's not a problem. But Elves that come from the West in silver ships? Hmmm...I think I read about that in \\"The Silmarillion\\". The last battle sequence on Tronjheim (which could have been Tuna from \\"The Silmarillion\\") felt almost exactly like the Battle at Helm's Deep from \\"The Two Towers\\". The chase from Gil'ead could almost be mistaken for either the flight from the Nazgul or the flight in Khazadum from \\"The Fellowship of the Rings\\". Urgals and Kull are most definitely \\"Orcs\\" and \\"Uruk-hai\\". And several names are incredibly close to LOTR ones (Eragon for Aragorn, Arya for Arwen--kinda a coincidence Eragon is a human and Arya is an Elf--Turin for Turin, Beirland is similar to Beleriand and so forth).In the beginning, when Brom is relating the history of the land, he talks about Galbatorix's rise to power. Or was it Palpatine/Anakin-Darth Vader? Hmmm... The Riders could have been the Jedi plus dragons. Also, as I look back, one could confuse Arya's rescue from Gil'ead to be Leia's rescue from the Death Star. Two men (Eragon and Murtagh in \\"Eragon\\", Luke and Han in Star Wars), one doesn't want to save her (Murtagh, Han, respectively), and both from a prison where she is close to being destroyed/killed. We even have our dear Obi-Wan Kenobi in Brom, who dies saving Luke...I mean, Eragon. I am still waiting for him to show up later as a ghost.Christopher Paolini had some of his own original ideas, but he obviously took (a little too heavily in places) from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I am surprised that the Tolkien estate and George Lucas aren't suing for rights.Some of the characters (Ajihad, Orik, and the like) are rushed in at the end and not given much time. However, this may be remedied in further books, so I won't hold this item against it.Also, I found the languages spoken in \\"Eragon\\" had more in common with baby talk than an actual language. I mean, \\"ono un atra ono waise\\"? I guess I spent too much time in Tolkien feeding off his knowledge of languages.Lastly, while this is impressive for a young adult, some of the conclusions are weak and the plot tends to be connect-the-dots or to skim over stuff. And Brom didn't think to trace the agents through the poison they used? That sounds completely out of character.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:The term \\"ba*****\\" is used, but I think that pretty much is it. Other colorful language is tastefully alluded to but not mentioned. Sexual situations are probably nothing compared to the Gossip Girl series, but I was a little disconcerted reading about \\"bedding the wrong woman\\" and how no one has a clue about his parentage in a book targeted to tweens and teens. Violence is a little more than I would have expected. Yes, swordplay, fist fights, and battles are the par and I expected that, but mention is made of \\"brains on metal\\" that completely grossed me out (and I felt were unnecessary).Overall:A good effort, but as I read certain parts, I was thinking, \\"Haven't I seen this before?\\" It will be neat to see what this young man comes up with as he grows older and develops his own ideas. I liked it and don't regret reading it, but this is definitely for those who are still on milk when it comes to fantasy. Hard-core fantasy lovers will get very upset."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Disappointing, but interesting.

Otherwise this book gave me nothing but pleasure reading it all night! A fave book of mine and I cant wait to get eldest (sequel)!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book would have been pretty decent if 95% of its ideas hadn't been used in about twenty other fantasy novels! To begin with, I had high hopes for this book, but it ended up being a blow out. I could relate just about every character, place, and plot twist to three or four other novels that I have read, plus I could relate a few things to Star Wars and The Matrix!Okay, in this story you've got your classic dwarves, elves, other magical beasties, a courageous hero who has to avenge the death of his family, and an old mentor who knows everything. But where would we be without the old mentor? Brom was one of the better characters in this book, and joined the ranks of famous fantasy and sci-fi mentors such as Gandalf, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Merlin...this list could go on for a while.The monsters in this book were pathetic. The Urgals and Kull were just fat, ugly guys with horns, and the Shade was a bad Dracula immitation. Just a reminder, but the Ra'zac were hissing black-cloaked figures that rode flying steeds. Sound familiar?The fight scenes basically stunk. They were far to gory and didn't have the thrill and exhiliration that made Tolkien's battles so great. Blood was prominent in most of the fights in this book, and Paolini does this a lot: Greusome fight detail...and blood splattered everywhere. I also think that Saphira's fighting style could have been depicted better.There were a lot of things in this book that I didn't get. In the beginning of the book, the plot revolves around Eragon's will to destroy the Ra'zac, but as soon as the camp is attacked in the middle of the night and the Ra'zac flee, they disappear from the story completely! And when Eragon wakes up after the Ra'zac attack, he discovers a mysterious man sitting in his camp, and brings him along on the rest of his journey, naturally. Who would have guessed that he was an invincible fighter and the heir to Morzan? Another thing- When Eragon and Murtagh journey to Gil'ead, it takes them nearly a month, but a journey twice that distance to the Beor Mountains takes them only eight days? It just doesn't make sense! I also feel that Eragon asks too few questions when he should, and too many when he souldn't.The \\"ancient language\\" didn't even come close to the caliber of Tolkien's Sindarin, and there were too many constanents jumbled together in so many of the words. The author got the language and about a jillion other things from LOTR.At the end of the book, the author tries to go off on tons of new plot twists, but he eventually just leaves them hanging. Here we are at the end of a book in this huge climactic battle, and it suddenly ends abruptly, leaving the reader saying \\"What the heck?!\\" Plus, the Twins didn't really serve a purpose in the story, and several of the chapters could have just been omitted.Absolutely nothing was resolved in this book, and it really diserved about two stars, but I gave Paolini a break because of his age. I hope the writing improves in book two, or else I won't bother reading it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My love for books ended me up in my public libary. I was craving something exciting and magical, so I asked the librarian to recommend something and she recommended this. As soon as I read the first few chapters I knew I was hooked! I was taken into a world of dragons, fighting and elves. I cant wait for the next addition to this marvelous series! Its so good I wish I could give it more stars!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an excellently written book written by a young man named Christopher Paolini. He and his book have raised high praise from many distinguished publishers and authors. Anne McCaffry (author of The Dragonriders of Pern series) gives him especially high praise when she says, \\"Full praise to Eragon and I want more! A winner... a tip of the hat to Master Paolini\\".Eragon is about a young boy (named Eragon) who lives in a city called Carvahall on the continent of Alagaesia. He finds a strange rock while hunting in a mysterious mountain range. He takes it home and quickly realizes that it is not a rock!?! It's a dragons egg!The egg hatches bringing mysterious strangers to Carvahall. These strangers are only the beginning of his problems, as he soon finds himself being fought over by the titanic forces on his continent, namely the Varden and King Galbatorix's Empire. There are tear-jerking moments and even a little laughter as you make your way through the book describing the life of the first of the next generation of Dragon Riders.As a whole I enjoyed the book... However there were a few things that annoyed me. First of all, it is all to obvious that the main characters name is a knock-off from the Lord of the Rings Aragorn. Also he tends to change pace quite a bit. For example one second he's in a cell drugged and can't escape, he falls asleep, but only after he gives us every single detail of the cell. Next page in two sentences he's out of the cell and dodging patrols.Despite these things Eragon is a fantastic book and I wholeheartedly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really liked this book even though it seemed like Lord of the Rings. I liked it becasue it is just like Lord of the Rings but way easier to read. Some kids have trouble understanding the big texty books while Eragon brings the same adventure but easier way to read.

Basically, it is old Star Wars' story (a farmer boy turns to Jedi Luke Skywalker = Rider Eragon against evil Empire) in the Tolkien setting. But, I think it is well written, and I enjoyed it very much. I don't think originality is critically important for a book to be entertaining.

Eragon runs for his life as he tries to outwit his enemies and survive.Eragon is a wonderful book with a plot so masterfully written it creates a world in which nothing is too intense, and everything is described with the utmost detail. A world of magic and dragons, elves, dwarfs and a quest for power will blow you away with the impossible."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I know, that you know, that I know, that you know, that a lot of people have said that this shamelessly rips off Tolkien, McAffrey, and others, and, I admit, this is somewhat true. No offnse, but what annoys me, however, are the people who would say that even if the Urgals in this book were tranvestites, that this rips off Tolkien horribly. That really annoys me. But, you can't stop the review from scrutinizing so.... here it comes!Eragon, who's name hails not from Tolkien's \\"Aragorn\\" but from \\"Dragon\\", with the first letter switched, is a poor farm boy [well okay that is a bit streotypical] with a mysterious past [ditto] who, one day, while hunting, discovers a polished blue stone in the forest. He takes it home, hoping to sell it for a few coins, but before he can, the stone hatches a dragon! Now the evil emperor badly wants the dragon, and his henchmen the Ra'zac kill his uncle and burn down his house to do so.

I am a avid Star Wars fan and, though I recognized alot of the movies in here, I still loved the book. If any of you know Star Wars fans you would probably have to say I am lying or am completely serious. Why? because we defend our favorite movies with passion and yet this book, which takes a bit from those very movies, does not spark any anger in me. In other words, you guys are just mad you didn't try something like this before this author did.Now to the rest of my review. I would have to say that I found this book extraordinarily hard to put down the second I started reading the first few lines. I had even seen the movie before reading the book and still found it nearly impossible to stop reading until around 3 am in the morning for the week it took me to finish. The story is engaging and has plenty of excitement. I would suggest is to just about anyone. And when I finished reading it I had to run to the bookstore to find its sequel right away. (A review for another time) This book will make you crave more from the next two books and I mean that in a good way. It read pretty well. I didn't even realize that the author was only 19 until I read his bibliography in the back.All in all, a great addition to anyone's library."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved the audio book.

This extraordinary book is about a boy named Eragon who is an orphan because his parents left him with his uncle and cousin for a reason. His cousin who now left because he is going to work at a windmill so he can earn money to buy a ring for the butcher's daughter and his uncle is like a farmer who always wakes up early. So while he goes to Broms house, he is a story teller and Eragon asks him what he knows about dragons. When he gets home, he finds the house burned and goes to look for his uncle and finds him under a pile of burned wood. From that day on, he went on a journey to kill the Ra'zac who killed his uncle. Brom finds out he is the next dragon rider. On the way they get caught by the ra'zac and Murtagh saves them. Later on Brom dies and Eragon saw the shining palm so that meant he was a dragon rider also but his dragon got killed. Murtagh is the father of the traitor that went with the king and was killed by Brom. Eragon makes a grave that says Brom was like a father to him and that he was a great dragon rider. I felt exited about the book because it leaves you in suspense at the end. The author had excellent visualization, characterization and excellent descriptions. I recommend this book to fantasy readers who like excellent books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Swush! Eragon and Saphira Gliding through the air like a bolt of lighting. Can you imagine what it would be like being a dragon or a dragon rider; you could learn what it would be like. This book, ERAGON is the best book ever and has excellent detail by Christopher Paolini.Eragon is a young teenager who finds a dragon egg in the forest while hunting but he though it was just some weird blue polished stone. Eragon lives with his uncle because his mom ran away and he never found out whom his dad is. Eragon and his uncle try to sell the egg but no one would buy or trade. Then one night the egg hatches and Eragon hides the growing dragon in the forest next to his house. Then Eragon decided to name the dragon Saphira. One night when Eragon got on Saphira she took of for the night then wouldn't bring Eragon back till morning. But when she did bring him back he saw his house blow up and found his uncle in the Debris Eragon tried to get him to a hospital but in the making went out cold. Once he woke up he was at Horst house who was hospitalizing him and his uncle but unfortunately his uncle Garow dies. After words Eragon decides to go off with Brom who said he would help Eragon with magic, fencing and Saphira. But then Brom dies and he joins up with morzans son, murtagh then they both join the Varden to rebel against the king and at the end there is a big war that if you want to find out about you have to read the book.One very exciting incident in the book was when Eragon and Murtagh where heading for the Varden to rebel against the king and the empire. On their way then headed through a thick forest and Eragon was riding on Saphira with Murtagh on the ground riding his horse. When about 250 urgals ran up behind with disoriented faces and horns so Eragon decided to from up in the air drop rocks on the urgals. Once they flew away they heard screams that sounded like the urgals where in excruciating pain. The sound of the screaming urgals was like 10,000 nails on a chalkboard.This is a master piece of great description and the author would always leave you hanging in the way that would make you want to keep reading until the entire series is over.

All in all an awesome book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I decided to read Eragon after my 10-year-old cousin raved about it. Knowing that it was written by a seventeen-year-old, I hoped to see potential beyond his age; unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. The book clearly carries a strong character and storyline, but the writing sounds like a seventeen-year-old, perfect for my cousin. The writing, though, was not its most blatant offense. I was most put off by its obvious route. I am pretty sure that I could predict the third book in this trilogy now (though I did read the second). The characters themselves were strong enough for me to continue on in the series and I will probably read the last book just to see this thing through.Paolini follows the typical fantasy guideline set down by the classics and does not seem to vary from them in the slightest - loss of father figure, unrequited love, ultimate evil, unknown family ancestry, fate. Paolini shows promise and I hope his future novels expand beyond the basic format of fantasy. Still, I would recommend this novel to younger readers since it is a great starting point to get into the fantasy genre beyond Harry Potter. If you are older than 14 or have read many fantasy novels, stay clear for you will soon become frustrated by the many obvious turns this book takes."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The neverending quest has just erupted.

I did too, but can't say I've found anything original in them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If anything positive can be said about this book is that it might be okay for young readers who've never read Tolkien, or seen Star Wars, or played any Dungeons and Dragons. Well, maybe I take that back. This book shouldn't be recommended to anyone, really.I had a lot of problems with it, the biggest one being that the whole story is nothing but a huge rip off of every fantasy/sci-fi epic imaginable. Secondly, the writing style is sloppy, and you can tell Poalini probably had a thesaurus in one hand as he was throwing this thing together. You have to respect Paolini a little, because it's obvious he's well read, and he did make a great effort to write a book at such an early age. But let's be honest, it's crap. I did some creative writing myself as a young teenager and was pretty excited about the stuff I wrote. Then a couple years later I reread it and realized it was all crap. It was so crappy that I trashed it all. Paolini should've given himself a couple of years before trying to publish Eragon. I'm sure once he matures as a writer and gains more experience, he'll be capable of more original and creative work. Until then, pass this one by."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've read hundreds of fantasy books and this is definitely the worst I've had the misfortune to read. Instead of reading this poorly conceived knock-off, I recommend that young readers check out Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series, Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series, Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, or if you like SciFi, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.I found Eragon to be a simplistic reworking of stories/themes. It is sad that the publisher's of the 21st century are playing it \\"safe\\", like most modern entertainment, and giving us nothing new. I was surprised that Anne McCaffrey endorsed this book. She writes \\"pulp fiction\\" fantasy too, but hers is much better. He even takes the name \\"Eragon\\", which is very similar to a character in her book, The Skies of Pern, named Erragon.I've never returned a book for my money back, so this was a first."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Back when this book first started getting attention, my grandparents bought it for me (7-8 years ago now? I can't remember honestly). They knew I loved to read and that fantasy was one of the many genres I was interested in. I wasn't planning on getting this book myself but since they had already bought it for me I gave it a shot.Unfortunately I found it rather boring. One of the biggest drawbacks for me was the poor dialogue. Awkward dialogue really snaps me out of the 'reality' of a story. It is just one thing that really hinders my reading experience. On top of that, I saw too many obvious parts of the story \\"borrowed\\" from other authors/stories as opposed to recognizing influence from.As far as the plot, it may have been something I would have enjoyed when I was much younger; It was very obvious that this book was aimed at someone much younger than myself. Just a little too predictable and because of that I didn't get very involved or interested in the individual characters. They felt a little \\"flat\\" and just existed to be a certain archetype for the story. It really felt like something many of my friends would have written in HS.I will note that it wasn't until later that I learned the author was so young. For his age, not a bad effort. Unfortunately, when I am rating a product, I only care about the quality of the product and not whether it was good for an author of that age.As far as readership audience, for an adult this is a 1 star in my opinion but for a pre-teen reader this might be a 2-3 so I just chose a 2 overall."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I, for one, was incredibly disappointed with this book. Let me start by saying that I love Fantasy novels, while I'm no nerd, they're fun to read. And not to mention the fact that this book was written when Paolini was just 15 is pretty cool, although I did take that into effect. Now I'm sorry if this is a TL;DR review, but there's so much wrong with this book that it's hard to condense into a short review. I read this long before the movie came out (and take into effect- the movie was not much better). Everybody was telling me that this book was the next best thing since sliced bread. So I read it. And WHOA, I was shocked at all the good press it was getting. This book is ridiculous. It's so over the top it's almost a parody of books of its kind. It's almost like a 500 page fanfiction. For one, he may only have been 15 at the time of writing. But that does not excuse the poor writing.Sometimes, Paolini will say something, take one word from it and then use a sentence that's totally pointless and irrelevant. It's distracting and extremely retarded. I've read Harry Potter fanfictions that are much better written than this garbage. Also, the battle scenes are poorly written. THey look like they written by an 8 year old. And Typos! Don't forget the bloody typos either. This book is full of them. And my \\"hair blowing in the wind\\" count went up to 50 before I gave up counting. As others have mentioned, Paolini rips off several sources, most notably LOTR and The Wheel of Time Books, despite WoT not being well written either (except at least the first three books were good). Paolini seems to have watched the LOTR movies countless times for the dialogue. And this book is so SLOOOOOOW!!!! And you thought the Twilight and Dexter books were slow. No, this one is way slower. The action hardly happens at all. Everything is so wrong with this book. And the characters are even more facepalm inducing. Eragon is pretty much a whiny emo for most of the book, Brom is annoying and full of himself. The rest... ugh.Now I know you fanboys/girls will flame my review for hating this book. \\"He was only 15\\" is no excuse, no matter how old he is should not justify how bad this book is. \\"He was INSPIRED, not ripping off\\" is a bad excuse either. This book is a ripoff of every fantasy book ever written. So go ahead and flame me for hating this garbage, but be warned, it's not like I'll care."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved this book!!!! Easily 1 of my favorites. Riddled with adventure, swordplay and magic but with 1 character that really has depth: Murtagh. He is one of my favorite characters in the series. I owe it to Mr. Paolini because he inspired me to write my own fantasy book entitled The Paladin King, (still under construction, though)A big thank you to Paolini:)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon seemed like a good idea that the author cheated on to make it happen. What I mean is what everyone else is saying... he just used remnants from other, better books to attempt to fuel his own. I don't care how old he is either, this kind of writing never should have gotten past the editors. Speaking of which... why DID they let it past them?I read the first chapter and was completely bored with it. That said, I decided to give it a chance because some books have rough starts and then turn into gems later. So by some miracle I got myself up to chapter 23 but that's as far as I got. I just couldn't take it anymore because it wasn't getting better and things were getting MORE cliche and cheesy.I suppose if I was a kid (who didn't know much about literature in general) and this was my first fantasy novel I might have enjoyed it a lot. So I can see how there are kids that enjoy this book but as an adult I feel like it's a travesty of modern fantasy.In conclusion, if you're a parent and have a child who can read this book, they might enjoy it (though they would be better off reading The Hobbit instead). If you're an adult looking for a good fantasy novel, this is NOT it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Don't get me wrong; I think it's totally admirable that a teenager could write an entire book. Lord knows I've started about a gajillion novels, and have yet to get beyond page 10, tops.That being said, this just isn't a good book. It starts off strong, yes. But the rest of the book feels distinctly unpolished. While I'd normally encourage a young author to let their imagination run wild as they write, Paolini took it to the point of things in the book just not feeling real (a multi-ton ruby encased in a mountain which is encased in another mountain? Really?). Characters are introduced, new plot lines are opened up, and then they're all immediately forgotten about. There are so many loose ends in this book it's like a plate of spaghetti.Instead, why not read 'Lord of the Rings'? About 90% of 'Eragon' seems to have been stolen from Tolkien anyway, including, for instance, the map at the beginning of the book and the language of the dwarves.I think if you're maybe age eleven or younger, then this book could fly. However, if you've read novels before, and are put off by poor writing style, then this book will make you grind your teeth."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I first read this book after a bunch of hype in Middle school and rather liked it. The thing that bothered me about this book was that is was a bit \\"over-seasoned,\\" and it seemed like Paolini was full of himself. Anybody who gives this book such high shining praise needs to take a second look. I do take note that a lot of reviewers who gave this book five stars have read many other fantasy books, and if they enjoyed it, its fine...But for thoughs who have NOT read a large collection of fantasy series need to set this series down and leave it alone to expand their horizons. This series (which are now four books in total) is a pure rip-off. Its your typical sugar-sweet package of \\"good-against-evil,\\" with Star Wars, Dragonriders of Pern and the Lord of the Rings mixed in, along with Paolini's own little twist. It makes me a bit angry that he so boldly took these elements and tried to create a masterpiece, which was a good effort, but not a winner in my opinion.Paolini has a lot of imagination and I praise him for that. But the way how he goes into detail, his choice of grammar and his little \\"language,\\" going on just doesn't cut-it. Its quite obvious at first read that this was written by a teenager, and not an adult with a bunch of experience backing him/her up. Whoever praises Eragon as the greatest fantasy author on the face of the planet is naive, and apparently hadn't read other great works of fantasy and or green to the genre.There are so many other books out there that are greater than Eragon, (such as my personal favorite The Symphony of Ages by Elizabeth Haydon) so if you are looking for another good series to read and take my advice, try something like The Lost Journals of Ven Polypheme, or at least some Dragonlance. For thoughs of you over the age of 13, try reading the SOA series or even some McCaffrey. Don't just stick with Paolini."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I actually re-read this, and almost reached the end without realising I'd already read it a year or so before. It's that memorable.It \\"borrows\\" heavily from several well-known fantasy authors' work, with little (if any) original content, and the sources are painfully evident throughout. Although it's readable, the writing is shallow and immature. This isn't surprising, considering the author's age. Yes, it's impressive that he finished it, but that doesn't mean it automatically deserved to be published, let along adapted into a movie. Avoid."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"500 pages? It's no wonder how they were able to cut it into a 100 minute movie. The only semi exciting thing that ever happened was when the dragon hatched. It was also a rip-off of Lord of the Rings. Urgals were like Orcs. Raz'zac were like Ringwraiths. Brom was like Gandalf. Arya was like Arwen. Murtagh was like Aragorn. Galbatorix was like Sauron. And Eragon was like Frodo (except stupid).So if you're looking for an exciting and original read. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon's got too many \\"tacked on\\" parts. For example, when Angela's explaining shades, she says \\"it's the most unholy magic...EXCEPT NECROMANCY\\" Where did the mention of necromancy come from? It is completely off topic. It's as if Paolini mentioned it simply for the sake of mentioning it.Another problem is the slave trade. Paolini tries to make it seem cruel, but the slave trade has no real part in the story. It exists for no reason other than making the Empire more dislikable.Too much of this book feels perfunctory, as if Paolini added it in simply because he thought he was supposed to."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the fantasy adventure genre! I have to disagree with the reviewers who criticize this fine novel for being too much like others of its genre -- yes, its characters and plots are familiar, but every genre has similarities, and if you like the genre, you will like this variation of it. The story line is comfortable and honest, and you find yourself really liking the characters and enjoying your time with them. Eragon is a teenage boy of mysterious parentage who finds a dragon egg, although the times when the Dragon Riders helped maintain peace and order in the land has been gone for a hundred years. Unfortunately, the hatching of the egg draws the attention of the forces of evil, who kill Eragon's adoptive \\"uncle\\" in the course of trying to capture the egg/dragon. This sets the plot in motion as Eragon and the dragon (Saphira) set out on what Eragon thinks is a simple quest for revenge, only to discover that they have become part of a much larger struggle for control of the empire, in which they are far from alone in their quest. This is an entertaining and often heartwarming fantasy/adventure twist on the timeless coming-of-age scenario. I (an educated and well-read adult) enjoyed it very much, as did the young teenagers in my family. I will admit that the author's youth and relative lack of sophistication often are apparent in the word choices and pacing, but everyone else who wrote a novel at age 15 please raise your hand! He's done something big here, it's worth your time, and we can look for more and better writing from him as he gets more experience."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The whole story is a clich&eacute;, I confess. Dragon Riders from Pern, elves and dwarves from LOTR, big nasty emperor from all sorts of places, poor kid whose relatives or mentor gets killed etc.It seems as if the book isn't worth all the clamor it is getting.But sometimes, there are exceptional cases where, even though there are clich&eacute;s, the story is still a page turner, and I think Eragon is one.Although there is room for improvement, but for a young author, who wrote the book when he was 16, it's a great start and I am looking forward to his next book.Forget clich&eacute;s, forget LOTR, just read and enjoy. Don't compare. Besides, if we were to critize every story just because it is similar to another one, why read then?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm not going to go into detail about how Eragon is a rip-off of a hundred better fantasy novels, or how craptastic the writing is, because it's been said enough already. I will say that if I was judging this purely as a novel standing on its own, without considering the age of the writer, I'd have given it one star. It really should not have been published, but Paolini is fortunate enough to have parents in the publishing business, and I can't really blame him for seizing the opportunity.I give it the extra star for potential. Paolini shows glimmers of some natural writing ability when he isn't trying too hard to sound like Tolkien. There are a few really good moments scattered throughout the pretentious dialogue and stale narrative which came out of nowhere and impressed me. If he takes some classes and irons out some of his bad habits, finds a competent editor, and gains about ten years more life experience and normal social interaction, he might produce something worth being mentioned in the same breath as McCaffrey and Tolkien."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is in the woods when he finds a 'stone' that will change his life forever.

It helped that I had a deep love of fantasy but this brings dragons to a new level. Once I started reading this it was impossible to read anything else. I repeatedly tried to put it down as I succumbed to sleep yet all I could think about was the hardship this young man was enduring.One of the main reasons that I could not give it the full five stars is because of the fact that it is a trilogy and I want t read the next one. I also noticed that time seemed to fly by with little detail; this is not necessarily a bad thing but should be clarified more.The detail that Paolini put into this book as a whole is monumental. His overall attention to detail was deeply appreciated along with the fact that he chose hi words carefully.I look forward to reading the sequel to this book and becoming friendlier with the story line."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon from Christopher Paolini is the first book in the trilogy. He makes this book an adventure filled one. Eragon, the main character, consistently is fighting evil and helping others. As you read my book review and others you may think \\"Why haven't I bought this book?\\" So sit back, read, and then buy it for Paolini's amazing love for fantasy writing. For it has really paid off as he takes you though magnificent adventures.Eragon is a book about a young man named Eragon who finds a mystical dragon egg and becomes a magical rider. This all takes place in Alagaesia, a land of magic. He battles evil and saves many people. The forces he fights are called Urgals, which are blood thirsty creatures under the control of Galbortix the evil king. Eragon, now the last dragon rider, is always battling with Galbortix's forces. There are quite a lot of characters in this story so here are the main ones: Eragon, Eragon's Dragon Saphira, Ayra the Elf, The Dark King Galbortix, Murtagah, Brom, and Duza the Shade.I thought this was a fantastic book. The flow was exceptional; he knew the exact right moment to put punctuation. His word choice was off the wall -- he wouldn't just use the same word or use boring and unfascinating words like good and great. One reason it was interesting was because it was like the other fantasy books and yet some how different. Also, the action would keep you asking for more and more.This book was written for Master Paolini's sister, Angela, and his mom and dad. I personally think this book is geared towards anyone who loves books and reading, but this is mainly meant for people around 9 to 21. I think any fantasy lover will treasure this book. Anyone who liked the Lord Of The Rings would simply die for this book. This is any fantasy fanatic's book for sure."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For those who have read the reviewer who has a veritable field day trashing this book, I remind you (and him) that Eragon is not meant for adults, that this is not meant to vie with Lord of the Rings. Yes, the writing isn't perfect (the characters speak beautiful English no matter what their social class, education,or emotional state of mind, for instance), but the writing is largely better than you will find in most fantasy books (for any age group) as well as in most young adult books. And, frankly, even Tolkien could have used a better editor as far as I'm concerned -- the man couldn't decide if he wanted to write a travelogue of Great Britain or a fantasy, and decided to burden us with both simultaneously!I pre-read it on behalf of my kids (at ten they're not ready for any heavy duty violence) and found it thoroughly engaging, though they'll not get the book until they're a year or so older. This is for a slightly more mature reader than one comfortable with the Harry Potter series. I do intend to get the next volume.

For young adults, very young, those who prehaps aren't as familiar with Lord fo the Rings, or Dragonrider, this may be an enjoyable experience but for me and let's just say I'm well over 25 years of age, blatant rip-offs are the only reason I read the book. Just to see how much of it was, well, wasn't ripped off. And there was very little that was truly original. My only reason for posting this review is that I have read articles that compare Eragon and Eldest to Harry Potter!!! Blasphemy! JK Rowling has created a truly unique reading experience with her HP series. An experience for all ages, whether the reader is or is not familiar with the likes of Tolkien and other such authors. I realize everyone is entitled to their own opinion and the above review is mine. All I asked is that writers, authors, critics stop comparing Eragon to the HP series.

Anytime a reviewer finds something about the book that needs improvement, she abandons constructive thought and hides behind the useless ad hominem of \\"U R just jealous!!!!!!\\"And there is, of course, the unavoidable issue of ripoffs, which she handles with the same intelligence (giggle, snort)and rationality (yeah, right): \\"There is no way around that flaw that I can give you now except: 'GET OVER IT!'\\" What she said is absolutely true. There IS no way around that flaw except the sort of taunt one would expect from a fifth grade playground bully.Just so she can't include me in her straw man target, I have to stress that I am not a nitpicker. I don't go over every book with a magnifying glass and pick at every flaw. The problems with Eragon are so blatantly obvious that anyone who can read at the book's intended age level (teens, not children, teens)can see the problems. In case DQ or anyone else can't understand it, let me spell it out for you:Ripoffs=BADPredictability=BADDull, flat characters=BADUnbelievability (like a months-old dragon acting like she's lived for centuries)= BADAnd to those who have criticized technicalities (too many adverbs, no use of the word 'said', etc.) I say \\"Go right ahead!\\" Paolini compares his work to Tolkien and Seamus Heaney. Don't forget that infamous quote about \\"lyrical beauty\\" that DQ has conveniently left out of her review.

A hack, a scoundrel and a fanfiction writer who has gone way overboard. My true beef with the book wasn't stylistically, aesthetically, or phonetically (albeit it didn't score much at all on those counts). No...what damns the writer (and the book) is its slapped around, preconceived ideas that can be better had from the original sources whence they came. The old school writers, Fritz Leiber, Anne McCaffrey, J.R.R. Tolkein, Mervyn Peake, Mallory...Anything but this insufferable rubbish..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this book because of all the press it was getting: a homeschooler, a self published book... and still it managed to sell a ton of copies and get \\"properly\\" published. A friend had bought it and loaned it to me; even said it was pretty good, not great, but good. My friend and the reviews were all sadly wrong.I wanted to like this book, I wanted it to be good. But I didn't, and it wasn't. The author broke the cardinal rule of writing; \\"Show don't Tell\\". Hundreds of pages are taken up with boring faux-history lessons thinly disguised as dialogue or \\"instruction\\" to Eragon. The book picks up pace in only a few very short places, but drags on endlessly for much of the 500+ pages.A good editor would have, after signing Paolini to a publishing deal, helped him cull out 100-200 pages of stuff that isn't necessary to tell the story. For all of his Tolkien-esque efforts it doesn't have the depth to it that Tolkien had. What he SHOULD have learned from Tolkien was that the boring back-story is best left to Appendix.Most of the reviews I found faulting this were due to it not being terribly original. I'm willing to give an author a pass on that if they do a good job of telling their story, unfortunatly Eragon doesn't pass that test either.Sadly, this was one of the worst books I've read in years. The bones of a good story are here, but they're buried so deep in mediocre to bad writing that I can't imagine wasting your time on this. I hope that he has learned from this experience and grows as a story teller for the rest of the series, or many trees will die in vain."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm 11 yrs old, and the first time I read this book, I was mildly impressed. It sounds like the author had talent, and people really did think the story was awesome, but if he just edited and critisized himself, Eragon could be a lot better. However, its true, there were too many copies from McCaffery and Tolkein and so many others it could hardly be called original.Really, though, Eragon was pretty good. It flowed unevenly, but not to the point where you couldn't understand it. Characterization, however, was awful. Eragon behaved nothing like the 15 yr old person I expected him to be. Some chapters he was arrogant, others humble, and sometimes painfully cheesy(like where he complements Murtagh on his skill with a sword. CHEESY!). And Eragon was just plain unlikeable. Brom was plain stupid. I hated him. He seemed to feel every sort of emotion in one chapter, then became the Gandalf-like teacher who was boringly patient. Arya was pitiful. She's unconsious the time where we could have gotten to know her, then she's nearly arrogant when she beats Eragon. That was the only time I actually was on the side of Eragon. Saphira was funny, witty, and sassy. I liked the dragon; somehow, this is the only character I find cool. Murtagh is boring, not being given enough speaking parts. Angela and her werecat were interesting, but not cool. There was also a girl near the end who was a good lead character, I forgot her name. She and Arya should have switched and the girl get more pages.There were a lot of ripped-off names, which you can find in various reviews. Isenmere, Isengard? That's a bit too much imitation. And is it Eragon-Aragorn, or Eragon-Dragon? Plus, the orc/urgal relationship might have been a fluke, but it went against the author. Arya is a bit like Arwen, but I think that was just a similar name.Now the important stuff: the writing style. There were bumps that I think an editor couldn't have smoothed out, and I think Paolini should have re-written those parts. It didn't flow. As it says in the Elements of Style (by William Strunk and E.B. White), write in nouns and verbs, not adjectives and adverbs. The author could've benefitted greatly if he'd only work on his voice and style. There are some great tips for any writer( including me) in there. Eragon went to sleep and got knocked out WAY too many times for it to be satisfying. And traveling by foot when a dragon could've been faster over a dangerous desert to get rid of Galbatorix sooner? Silly mistake. Shouldn't the editor have said something? Or was there an editor? At some places, it didn't sound like it. And the many adjectives and adverbs could have been okay if they were slipped in more subtly.All in all, if you like a story with a basic plotline, read Eragon. If you want characterization, don't read it. As for me, I'm in debate. The author has some talent, but it doesn't show much. I'll wait to find out what happens to Saphira, Angela, and that girl until I know if the author got better."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a horrible.

His use of simile at times simply does not work. I think he worked too hard trying to impress people with this \\"skill\\" and not enough on simply telling the story.In the hands of a more experienced author this would have been an awesome book.If you approach this book as a mediocre read, you might just be impressed.

While this is a genre in which some overlap is inevitable, Paolini makes little attempt to avoid it.Some of the characters seem flat, especially that of Eragon, the character who the reader should most identify with. Arya the elf, was a interesting character, who I will enjoy seeing further developed in subsequent novels, but Paolini does not make as much use of her as he could have done. He also fails to make the reader care for the characters, particularly those who die.Paolini's book is a bestseller, but it is not a masterpiece. It effectively does what it says on the tin, a sub-Tolkien fantasy that will make millions at the box office when the unavoidable movie rears its ugly head in 2006, maybe sell a couple of billion copies, and generally make its creator a very rich man.But, like so many books, it will make little mark on the rockface of a genre that has remained unchanged for over 70 years."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Funny how if you don't agree with the minority who are hyping this book you are some kind of monster.

A friend had recomended it to me and said it was worth my time...Oh what a dissapointment. As I read the first pages I found myself asking how did this guy get publsihed? There's gotta be some sort of marketing genius behind this. Of course, I didn't know of Paolini's age. Sure he started when he was 15 years old, big deal. If I'm forking out 20 bucks for his book, the only thing I care about is quality. Age is not an excuse for plagerism. I'll cut him a break on the writing style itself. As a matter of fact, it wasn't completely terrible. For a young man, Paolini definitely has some writing skills, I just wished he would use them to craft something original. The plot reads a lot like LOTR dumbed down for anybody with ADHD, (myself included)who doesn't have the time or patience to think while reading. It felt as though Paolini had taken some Tokien, some Mcafferey and and a lot of Star Wars and put them all in one giant blender and pushed the \\"ripped off bestseller button.\\" I could find absolutely nothing original in the book; nothing! Don't get me wrong I understand authors borrow from tradition and other authors. Tolkien did it plenty with Norse mythology. However great authors take that and change it into something new and different. Paolini does not. Everything in his book is borrowed and done much worse then his predecessors. Brom the \\"story teller\\" reads a lot like he one a Gandalf look a like contest and let it get to his head. Saphira the Dragon becomes some worldy scholar in a matter of months fromh er birth. It's ridiculous.The character development was some of the worst I have ever read. Each character was cliche and one dimensional. Eragon, the so called hero of the novel, is nothing more then a whining brat who feels sorry for himself. He starts off as a punk, he ends as a punk. Gimme a break.As for the cliches of the book, don't even let me start. At one point a man tells Eragon, \\"May your swords stay sharp.\\" Umm ok...that's kind of the point of a sword. But thank you for that inspiring advice because I believe Eragon was going to bludgeon his enemies to death with the hilt of his blade. O and what a suprise! A hero saves a young woman in distress and then saves the world!AS for the writing, it wasn't completely horrible, (although ti wasn't good). Paolini shows some potential and that's why he gets two stars. With some originality, Paolini could have hope. Until then I consider hima thief, a clumsy thief at that who trashes great authors' work.

However, this novel, with over 500 pages, was the most interesting and well written book I have ever read.The author, Christopher Paolini, was just 16 when he wrote this saga about a boy named Eragon and his dragon. This boy can talk to his dragon with his mind, and that is how he trusts the dragon. As the dragon grows up, he starts to wonder if meeting this dragon was by chance, or if it was meant to happen.Eragon has a freightless journey until a griping twist appears and he has to reach deep within his heart to solve this one of a kind chapter in reading history.This story is so long because it has to be. It has so much action and suspense, that if it were any shorter, there would have to be a sequel.I rated this story five stars because it is so well written, and young Master Paolini describes the scene with such detail and flow of words. If you liked the Lord of the Rings volumes and other novels about dragons and medieval combat, then Eragon is for you.Cheers to young Christopher Paolini!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't need to write about it's similiarities with all the other books(LOTR, C.S Lewis, even the Dark Tower Series). I will say that this book was a total snooze alert.I thought about how I should write this review. Is it fair to compare this author who is so young with all the other great authors as to give a realistic review of this book? The answer of course is YES!If you look at it as a pretty good book written by a 15 year old, then your rating will be much higher. The problem I have is if you are a published writer and are receiving cash for your efforts, then you will have to write much better book then this. It reads like it was written by a 15 year old. In fact, I pulled out some of my stories that I wrote when I was around this age, and found that mine read almost exactly the same, complete with bad grammar, erratic plot movement and awkward character development.I hate to be so harsh on this book, but I want to make sure that anyone who reads it, does not get any false impressions. This book was recommended to me by someone who reads a lot and has never let me down. He knows I like pretty much any decent fantasy series and my standards are not all that high. This book did not meet even my low standards for a decent fantasy novel.If I was a kid around this authors age, I would think this book was amazing. Not because of it's content, but because it was written by someone around my age, and is a big FU to the adult world. Fortunatley, I'm not and think that any adult who reads will find this story a little tough to read through.Here's the Breakdown:1. If you go into this book thinking, \\"Ahh, it was written by a 15 year old kid. I'm going to cut him some slack.\\", and if you have not read really any other fantasy series, especially Tolkien or Lewis; you will think that this book is pretty good. If you are under 16, and have not really read any other major fantasy series, you will think that this is the holy grail of fantasy books, and crush all who oppose your view.2. If you are a hard core Tolkien or Fantasy reader, you will find this book to be a cheap imitation of any fantasy book you have read before. It draws on way too many elements from these series, and feels like you're proofreading a high school english paper. I happen to fall into this category.On a postive note, I think that the next book in this series will be much better. I also think that we can expect much better things from this young author. You can see his vision and he does have some very good ideas. I am excited to see is next project."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The current marketing ploy gaining favor amongst publishers these days is the old \\"a teenage wrote this book\\" trick. Books like \\"The Secret of the Stones\\", \\"Please Don't Kill the Freshmen\\", and \\"Eragon\\", have all hit the heights that they have because their authors are so doggone young. Of the three I've just mentioned, \\"Eragon\\" is universally acknowledged to be the best written. A fantasy of epic proportions I continually found myself cooing over writing styles and plot points that were remarkably well thought out for a fifteen year old. Then I realized what I was doing. What if I hadn't been aware of the author's age? What if, instead, I had just picked this book off of the shelf and read it without any prior knowledge of the hype surrounding this first novel? So I am going to pay Christopher Paolini a dubious honor. Rather than review this book as if I was writing some dumbed down version of what I was actually thinking, I'm going to treat Mr. Paolini as I would a real author. Criticism intact.\\"Eragon\\" is the tale of a boy and his dragon. Living in a mythical land named Alagaesia, we meet our hero. Eragon is fifteen going on sixteen and an excellent hunter. Living with his uncle and cousin, one day he stumbles across a beautiful large blue stone. It isn't long afterwards that he discovers that the stone is actually a dragon's egg, and the creature inside comes out to befriend him. Named Saphira, the two become inseparable, and Eragon finds himself in the middle of a centuries long conflict. The dragon Riders have long since disappeared, but Eragon's appearance means that there may be hope in defeating the evil King Galbatorix who rules Alagaesia with an iron hand. Along the way Eragon befriends swordsmen, saves an elf from prison, and battles an evil being called a Shade.This is definitely somewhere we've been before. That would be all right, though, if it didn't have so many other problems. For one thing, there are some literary conceits here that I thought we'd moved past. Let's examine the role of women in this book. Every male character in this tale is ready and willing (if stout hearted and true) to fight. Women, however, or generally weak. When evil monsters threaten a hidden land, the women and children are taken away. We do have two that remain to fight, but they're definitely not the norm. Then there's the fact that no character in this story is allowed to have a living/breathing mother. If you're under the age of 30, it's ten to one that your mother probably abandoned you or died when you were little. Finally there's the small matter of names. Now I'm sorry, but don't you consider it the slightest bit confusing that Eragon fights the Ra'zac with Zar'roc? Just move the letters around for a little while.So the ideas are a little weak. And the writing itself? How well does the author weave a plot for children? In many ways, his writing is adept. If Paolini excels at anything, it's description. Just read this: \\"The second man had a florid face. The skin around his jaw was dry and corpulent, filled with lumps of hard fat, like cold butter gone rancid\\". Such eloquent passages pop up regularly, but description isn't everything. The story of \\"Eragon\\", though derivative, is also prone to acts of extreme violence. Babies are impaled on spikes. A relative of our hero is subjected to cruel tortures. There's even a threat of rape lobbied against one of the few females to grace the book's pages. Though the author understands that you must convey the threat posed by the bad guys, he does so in a sometimes heavy manner.Finally, my favorite objection to this book. It got to the point where I started keeping track of the times that Eragon went to sleep. As it stands, the book is a hefty 497 pages of text. Perhaps this could have been halved if Paolini hadn't decided to spell out every single time Eragon beds down. Of direct references alone (not moments alluded to, though there were plenty of those as well) I counted 19. If you want to have some fun, read the first sentence of the 4th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 23rd, 27th, 29th, 31st, 34th, 35th, 36th, 38th, 39th, 41st, 45th, 48th, 52nd, 54th, 56th and 57th chapters. I've never witnessed a character that did so much waking up. Even more fun was counting the number of times Eragon is knocked unconscious. A book reviewer once commented that you can sometimes tell how good a book is by how many times its hero is knocked out. This is usually a literary technique that allows the lazy writer the chance to move from one scene to another without a lot of exposition. \\"Eragon\\" contains at least six such moments. Six.So the book isn't the best written in the world, no. Just the same, I can see plenty of parents eagerly purchasing it for their kiddies. There's violence, but few adults monitor this kind of material in stories. If I've seemed a little mean in this review, I'm sorry. I think Christopher Paolini has a lot of talent. I do! I just think he should start using that talent to write something a little more original. There is some comfort in the fact that as he ages, his writing will probably mature. Unfortunately, we have to witness the stages he's going through until it does. My advice to the man is this: Ease up on the Tolkein, and shy away from the Star Wars. Try not to foreshadow things too intensely (if the reader doesn't figure out who the Varden spy is by the end of the book, they'd have to have been reading the book backwards). And for crying out loud, give us some strong women that aren't motherly or hot. Please?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Master Paolini did a job well done on this.

I think people need to stop and take a few moments to think about what truely Paolini has done, he has wrote a book, published it and made it a bestseller all by the time he was nineteen, now that is amazing, so i ask of those who think his book bad ro a rip off to rethink themselves, give the guy some credit. If you were fifteen years old and you sat down and and tried to write a book and map out a trilogy, I bet one of the first thoughts that would pass through your head would be what evryone else did. Not only that, if your fifteen, one you haven't totally matured and you are going to be influenced, two, there is very little in the genre of fantasy that is original, so that is hard to work around. But I still can admitt, Paolini could have been a bit more original.Now that I've gotten that out I will review the book for content.Why to read it?The book was overall a excitive and action packed book. I was amazed at paolini creativeness and imagination. Also, though many people don't argee, I thought that Paolini's paragraphs of description were good, they allowed me to see what Eragon was seeing, it made the landscape, the cities and the people all that much more real, where the words painted a picture in my mind that I could see. Also I found the telepathic communications between Saphira and Eragon well constructed and original, something I hadn't seen before and enjoyed. Moreover the book is mainstream fantasy, and I like mainstream fantasy, anyone else how does should try this. Also I found the language that Paolini made up, modeled after Norse, I think, well, it was cool, and I found it better than Tolkiens. Also the landscape was really cool, I just hope that Eragon travels the east and we learn more about what is there. I know a good deal of people that said the book wasn't well written. I don't argee, it is written fine, as well as any fantasy novel is and it far passes the standard that writers like Jordan have set with his newest books. The history and concepts behind the series is also good. Also I have heard that the dialouge in the book is not well written. Again I disagree. The dialouge was well written, in fact, Paolini has a very good knowledge of the English language, especially considering that he only nineteen and nearly all of his life is ahead of him. This book is very good, it has a good mix of exticement, action, entrigue, history, and battle that make it five stars.Why not to read This?I don't really have any reasons as to not to read this, only if you don't like fantasy, are sick of the traditional fantasy and 'safe' plots. Also if you are a Tolkien lover and you find nearly every he didn't write you find a copy of his work then, please, don't ruin it for everyone, thousands of young adults, how the book was written for, love this.I wish to give Master Paolini my best wishes, he is quite a respectable young writer, I hope to see many more years of him and many nore books that were just as exciting as this one. I give my full praise to Eragon. Job well done Master Paolini."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When i first began this book, i said to my self \\"Yeah right he's a ninteen year old kid, can he really actually write?\\" Let me tell you, the answer is \\"YES!

That's how Eragon feels in Christopher Paolini's fantasy novel, Eragon. His life takes a seriously sharp turn, starting at worrying about finding food for his family, to going on a journey looking for the Ra'zac, who hurt his family.In this wonderfully descriptive novel, Eragon takes a trek through all of Aaglaesia, and he learns perseverance, he becomes brave, and always thinks positive, because he has nothing left to loose. Eragon loves his dragon, Saphira, and they work together as a great team, and as best friends; getting each other through hard times. Even in those hard times, Eragon is open to change. But at 15 years old, can he cope with enough change in his life to rid the world of evil, and keep everyone safe from harm?This book is great for anyone with an imagination. It is a good book for around 5th grade and up. Being book #1 in the Inheritance Trilogy, Eragon includes many mysteries and different themes, such as love, friendship, heartbreak, using bravery, and acting strong. Paolini uses great detail, and really develops an amazing, adventurous world, that anyone would want to escape into. Are you ready to ride the roller coaster through Eragon's life?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great peice of literary work and has been a great adventure. It has been for me an enticing and consuming piece of work that has captured the brillance of the fantasy world.The characters are so real they seem to jump out of the book and it's like you're not reading but watching the movie. You can become so involved in this book it's almost as if you're in the world it's self. Going on the daring adventures running from the ra'zac on horse back,sparing at night with Brom and learning magical words to protect your self from enemies.This book is an adventure like no other. You can really feel the power of the book and feel the emotion that the writer wrote with. Feel the depth of the souls of the people that were slain in the towns that Brom and Eragon passed through.This book is masterfully written with great vocabulary and grammar skills.I am awaiting patiently for Eldest to come out so I can read the continuation of this trilogy.In my oppinion it is masterfully done and Christopher Paolini Deserves the credit that is due to him. In all honesty I think this book is incredible and the next book I am sure will be even better and more exciting than Eragon. Which I dunno how you could top Eragon but I am sure the adventure will continue and will continue to capture the minds of people of all ages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book is quite good for a 15 year old's writing. Unfortunately, it just doesn't quite compare to older, more seasoned writers.Paolini definitely still needs to find his voice - right now it seems like he's trying to pull what's cool, popular and successful in fantasy and mash them into his own book. If one took the Dragonriders from Pern (Anne McCaffrey), and mixed them with the Heralds of Valdemar (Mercedes Lackey) you would get the Riders almost exactly. Many of the names and descriptions are also reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, as others have pointed out. In a nutshell, well versed fantasy readers will probably start having flashbacks of other books while reading this one.Technically, the writing is fairly good - Paolini has some talent for his age and will probably blossom into a gifted author with time and practice. It does have flaws though - some of the vocabulary seems strained, like big words were put in there for the sake of being big words, and some of the dialogue and descriptions are confusing.Character development is also lacking. I didn't have feelings of remorse when any of the characters fell into misfortune because I didn't feel connected to them. I'm not particularly worried or anxious to see what happens in the next book because of this reason - this is probably one of the book's biggest downfalls too. I just don't *feel* connected to the characters in the same way that I did Frodo and Sam for instance. The reason for this is because the author brushed by many character developing conversations, opting instead to describe the way magic works or the scenery. I can think of only two real instances where there were character developing scenes or conversations, and the aftermath of these were pushed aside and forgotten for the most part. This is the area I feel the author needs to work on the most for his next book. As Eragon is now, it feels like a (huge) backstory to a roleplaying game, not a book.All in all, the book is decent, but far from the best in the field. The author still has a lot of growing up to do, he needs to find his own voice and learn some more on the basics of character development in particular. But if he can do this, I'm sure he will be a fantistic writer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am disgusted that people are comparing Eragon to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy! I have also read reviews that Eragon \\"faints\\" to much! He doesn't faint, he passes out. If you were at such a high altitude that you had no oxygen, would you pass out? If you got hit with say, a rock in the back of the head, would you pass out? Eragon, pronounced, Er-uh-gahn, is also not copying, anything! People seem to think that Paolini copied off of Aragorn, from Lord of the Rings, of course, and maybe, the word dragon! If you people haven't figured out that, though the names may look the same, their pronounced differently! Those people who gave Eragon a 1 or 2, really have no sense of imagination at all! And don't give me, that \\"Eragon copied off of\\" whatever book crap! There are differences that most people can see! Ever notice you can understand Eragon a lot better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy?

The two main characters are Eragon, a brave young boy with powers beyond his wildest dreams, and Saphira, Eragon's dragon and best friend. Together they face dreaded Urgals; survive scorching deserts; and save a nation, known as the Varden. This story is set in the fictional land of Alagaesia. Alagaesia is an empire with many rivers, plains, mountains, and deserts. This story was so readable because of its ongoing theme that you will always prevail if you stay true to your heart, your friends, and your dragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Although the plot was somewhat predictable, over all the series is exciting and captivating. I can see the influence of many fantasy novels at work in the pages however it does not make for any less interesting of a story and the ideas are his own. Christopher's language and imagery play a major role in catching my interests and holding them. As part of the same generation as Christopher I do not take kindly to the comments insulting his work when relating to his age. Not only do commenters insult Paolini for his age but also his readers claiming those who read and enjoy his work must surely be young as well. I see no lack of skill in the manner he composed the story and while many details parallel Tolken's Lord of the Rings Trilogy I enjoyed this much more due to the way in which this book was written. Unlike struggling to find interest in Tolkien's books Eragon was easy and fun to dive into. While many may find the simplicity unglamourous for me in it lies the charm."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Yes, Christopher Paolini does seem to have taken a lot from well-known fanatasy authors (it seems to me that he must have read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series right before writing this book). Yes, he really likes to flaunt the fact that he knows a lot of big words, although he doesn't seem to know quite how to use them within the context of the story and to help the language flow nicely. And yes, the characters lack a lot of personality and development. However, all that aside, Eragon really is a fun book to read, as is its sequel, Eldest. As long as you're simply reading for enjoyment, these books are a great choice. Especially considering the fact that Paolini was 15 when he wrote it. Kudos to him for that alone, because no matter how much I complain about the things that bother me about his writing, he did actually write a novel (two, even), and get it published, which is something that I've yet to do. I think these books are also a good starting place for someone who hasn't read much fantasy because there isn't as much depth to it as Tolkien, Jordan, and the like.Whether or not it is entirely original material, Eragon is full of adventure and is very enjoyable light reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a story about a boy, a dragon, and magic. Eragon was out in the woods, hunting, when he hears and feels a violent wind. When he opens his eyes, in front of him lays a beautiful blue stone, or so he thinks. After many failed attempts to trade it for family necessities, he gives up and simply leaves it alone. But one night the blue stone hatches, and a baby dragon appears. They go on all sorts of adventures together, find out things they never even dreamed of, and discover secrets.Although some of the previous reviews were rather harsh, I agree somewhat with them. Eragon does have a familiar ring to it, from the plot all the way down to his name. However, unlike the other reviews, I rather thought the story was oddly comforting. Christopher Paolini seems to have taken the best of all other fantasy books, put them together, and put a fresh twist into the plot. I enjoyed reading Eragon and I do recommend it to you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While I don't profess to be an expert on Sci-Fi/Fantasy novels, I did enjoy this book. My husband and I have created a habit of me reading aloud to him in the evenings. We started just before HP6 came out, going through the whole series in just over two months. Since we have finished that I have been looking for another series to read to him. One of our 17-year- old's friends let me borrow Eragon, knowing of our tradition and liking for this style of reading. Despite the sometimes juvenile feel, it was a wonderfully cozy book. Congratulations to Mr. Paolini for his courage to write his book. Who better to write a book about a young man coming of age while having to make adult decisions, than a young man.To those critics who don't like it, fine. Just remember, he will only get better with time and experience. Give him a chance."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't mean to add salt to the wounds (if you don't know which wounds I am referring to, continue searching through these reviews) but this book is a sad representation of literature. Many argue that if a book can get kids to read than it can't be bad, but the truth of the matter is books like this should result in legal action rather than video game licensing and movie deals.I struggled to find a single original idea in this entire work, that's right there is not even one. What's worse is the presentation of the stolen ideas doesn't come close to the quality of the originals from which it steals.I agree with what others have said in that the biggest tragedy is that there are dozens of authors out there who have struggled to come up with original fantasy novels that have gone unnoticed by the masses. This is a sad exercise in the power of money when it comes to promotion. Let's face it, anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of the English language coupled with a near limitless parental budget and a head full of borrowed ideas should be able to duplicate this novel's efforts.Finally to everyone who insists that all fantasy is a rehash of prior concepts, I say simply this: Put down Eragon and read more fantasy. There are original works out there; if not entirely original races and settings, there are more original plots, less stereotypical characters, fewer literary clich&eacute;'s.Give Harry Potter a try, Artemis Fowl, Inkheart, The Uncommon Adventures of Tucker O'Doyle, Erec Rex: The Dragon's Eye, etc."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Both my husband and I just finished reading Eragon. We both enjoyed the book very much. I wouldn't say it was the best book I've ever read, but I would recommend it.I've read a lot of the reviews and it looks like a lot of people really want to trash the book and the author. There is nothing that everyone thinks is 'good.' So the goodness of a thing must exist in the mind of the perceiver. It is subjective.I have seen all the Star Wars movies and yet I never really thought of the plot similarities until I read someone pointing them out. I did notice common elements with LOTR, but that didn't take away my enjoyment of the book.I feel the value of a book is the enjoyment it brings to the reader. Obviously there are many, many people who have read the book and enjoyed it, despite the similarities to other stories or the author's writing skills (which some people felt were not up to par).Anytime you read a book you are taking a chance you won't like it.

If the book entices kids to read, I don't think we should quibble over how many times the word \\"said\\" (or it's variations) is used!

I have read books by Tolken, Jordan, and other fantasy writers and I have to place this book towards the top of my list. It is very well written, giving you the chance to experience every environment, allowing you to feel the scales on Eragon's back, causing you to feel the emotions that the main character is going through. Rarely is such a wonderful job done in taking a character from a young child to a young man. Most of the time that process is filled with angst and drama and in general, the author attempting to explain a process that they don't understand. Paolini does a great job giving you those emotions without giving into the general cliche of an angst ridden teenager.I enjoyed this book because it does a wonderful job of pulling in the reader. It has enough characters to give it a juicy social life without causing the reader to become bogged down in a thousand different back stories and a hundred different webs of lies and deceit. I would recommend this book to most people because I have had experience reading fantasy and this is a very good book. It will be interesting to see if Paolini can keep his next book as interesting, but since he is such a young writer, still developing his style and his craft, I have a feeling he will meet the challenge, just as he has done with this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While I admire Paolini for writing this book and getting it published at such a young age, I thing (and I never thought I'd say this about a book) that it is too much like another book; specifically, the Lord of the Rings.My criticisms: he uses too much description- not enough things happen in 500 pages to, well, fill 500 pages. It was too long (another thing I never thought I'd say about a children's book.) I didn't like Eragon himself very much, or any of the other characters really, except for Sapphira.The good stuff: Sapphira is the only reason I think I'll read Eldest when it comes out. She's funny, and I like her outlook on human nature. The relationship between her and Eragon is interesting, and was probably the only reason I managed to finish the whole book.The conclusion: was it worth reading? Yes.Would I read it again?

Okay. The fact was, this book was exactly that. The plot was clearly a patchwork of influences, from Star Wars to Eddings to Tolkien. A farmboy with a destiny who lost his parents flees his little village with a storyteller who isn't all he appears... sound familiar? Somehow in the span of a few chapters, he becomes a blade master and magician. The magic is a copy, and even the scene where he releases his gift (with the blue fire) isn't original (see Queen of Sorcery). The only real difference from any story that I've read is that this boy has a dragon, who he is mentally linked to, he being a \\"Rider.\\" The story itself plods along, and it seems that Eragon blacks out at the end of every chapter. Saphira was a little amusing, but only a little. The non-human races are Tolkien copies, with boisterous dwarves and the almost-divine elves. Some of the plot lines are a little unbelievable, even for a fantasy. Arya emerges from a coma after weeks of dying by slow poison, and in one night is fit enough to duel Eragon? Please! Hopefully book two will make up for this a little more, but honestly, I think I can already figure out the connection between Eragon and Murtagh, so I won't be keeping my fingers crossed."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Sure, all you english know it alls can go off and tell us about how cliche the book is.

You can't expect a Tolkien level book from a 15 year old kid who hasn't even been alive as long as most well known authors have been writing. Sure there are tons of ripped off names and ideas (i.e. Tronjheim. Ever heard of Trondheim, Norway?) but that does not make this a bad book! I personally like just sitting down to read an entertaining story, and this did just that. All you cynics need to calm down and appreciate the story for what it was written for.

Now the movie may have been horrid, there is no denying that. The series, however is very intriguing. It is not meant to be sophisticated nor is it meant to be a literary masterpiece. It is a story meant to be read for the pure enjoyment of it. If all you are going to do is complain about it, then do not pick it up again. Let sleeping dogs lie.

Also he said Paolini put so many of the cliche characters of so many other fantasy stories (elves, dwarves, dragons, etc.). First of all, I have to admit I am a big fantasy reader myself, and, yes, I did find a few references to other books/authors, but not an entire book full, and the rest of it was completely original. As for the cliche creatures, name 2 fantasy books that don't have elves, dwarves, and dragons. Also the complaining reviewer forgot to mention the original creatures Paolini put into his book, such as urgals, shades, etc. But the reviewers main complaint was that the book was unimpressive for a book, but impressive for a 17 yr. old. When I read the book I constantly had to remind myself that it was written by a 17 yr. old, and not a 40 yr. old.One of my favorite aspects of the book (but probably one of the more cliched parts) was the concept of dragon riders. Of course the name dragon rider was obviously gotten from McCaffrey, and the fall of the dragon riders a bit Star Warsey, but still I thought it was still a good part of the book, especially Brom's tales of the dragon riders.In conclussion, I will definitly buy the second book, eldest, and not-so-patiently await its release."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Some die-hard fans of LOTR seem to be really offended by this book.

Just enjoy it!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I always find it so interesting that we live in this world of over rated critics. It is far easier for someone to criticize someone else's work than to be able to sit down and write a good book of their own. If the people who have criticized this book have this much knowledge of good writing (doubtful) then why haven't they taken the time to sit down and write a book themselves In this day of tough and competitive book publishing, do these ciritcs really thing that Knopf publishing is going to stick its neck out in publishing a book that isn't going to be successful? I commend Christopher Paolini for using his talents and staying the course. He is a credit to our teenagers in as much as most of them cannot even write a decent sentence let alone a book. And I am quite sure that many of the critics of his work have teenagers that fall in this category of being barely able to spell their own names, let alone have any imagination. Until they have tried to write a book I find they have little room to critizie. These critics would do far better in seeing that our education system is able to turn out more teen agers like Chirstopher Paolinin then tearing this young man's work apart. This is why my title says, \\"Those who can do, those who can't, criticize."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Not since I read Anne Rice's Witching Hour, have I been completely wrapped up in a story like this one.

I started reading it, found that the boy finds dragon, boy becomes valiant warrior cliched storyline is in this book. However, Paolini takes this cliched storyline, throws in some original things and makes an exciting and involving book that you won't be able to or want to put down.What amazes me most about this book is that Paolini wrote it when he was still in high school. A huge achievement for someone his age as most fantasy authors are at least in their 20s when they write their first novel. He certainly has a skill writing and I think that he will have a very successful carrer as an author.If you haven't read this book yet, shut off your computer and go buy it or check it out from the library.

(really bad!)I'm glad that somebody else realized how this is basically an imitation of the Lord of the Rings and other famous fantasies. All of my friends love Eragon but haven't read The LOTRS or any other famous works. I was forced to read this by a \\"friend\\" that loved it. I thought it was \\"OK\\", but when I started the second book, I put it down after 5 chapters or so. The author basically copied lines from the LOTRS. Isn't that ileagal!? I threw that book at my friend. I'm afriad to see the movie because it could be a remake of the LOTRs movie. The author is making money off of ideas that the great authors of past worked so hard to accomplish. I think I'll check back to this author in maybe 60 years when he's learned how to create his own ideas. (And it's not only because he was 17 when he wrote it, I've read books by 13yr olds that were published that are better than this. Like in the Forests of the Night and Demon in My View.) He only got this book published because his parents were publishers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"the only redeeming factor about the whole \\"inheritance\\" saga is that it was written by a 15 year old! original ideas of various literary greats have been plagirised without a thought. i am surprised that no legal action has been taken by such writers or their representatives against mr. paolini.ps. gets 1 star because amazon wont let me write the review without rating the book and this is the least number of stars."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga.

That is an incredible feat, which would be more remarkable if the ideas portrayed in the story hadn't already been used. Sure the captivating story of a young boy who is lost in the world and is just trying to figure out his place is interesting, but the interest tends to fade about the one-thousandth time you read it. The other flaw that I found in the book was the familiar characters from J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings Trilogy-The elf with mysterious powers-the dwarves that tunnel underground-The monstrous creation of a seemingly unbeatable army and the familiarity of names such as, Arya and Arwen, Eragon and Aragorn, Urgals and Orcs. I also observed a dash of Harry Potter magic between the pages. I hold a love for Fantasy novels, but just because it is catagorized as a fantasy doesn't mean it has to include elves dwarves, magic, and dragons- I think the tires on that wagon are running thin (the extreme length of the story didn't help either). I look for a fantasy novel that invents new ideas and new creatures for the mind to explore, that it why I rated this book as a TWO. I also like a novel that can keep my attention for the entirety which Eragon also lacked to do. So I would only reccomend this book to someone who really enjoys the same old thing, all you other adventurers look for your entertainment elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"think about it, all the people that say it is a bad book are adults! from a kids point of view i think its a great read. all the kids in my school think the same thing- ITS A GREAT BOOK! ive read all the good book, like harry potter, the lord of the rings, the hobit, and all those amazing books and i think this one would fit in right along side them. sure the auther uses some good ideas from other authers but i think that that is fine! so basically i think you should read the book no matter what the reviews say!

It eventually reveals it's not a stone; it's a dragon's egg! Owning a dragon makes a lot of trouble for Eragon. It gets several people killed or hurt. He then realizes he can't live a normal life and embarks on a journey with a village storyteller, Brom. Brom teaches him to fight in sword and magic. Telling anything past this would be a spoiler, so you'll have to read it for yourself.My favorite part of this story is when Eragon and his allies, the Varden, fight a war with the Urgals, which are human like except they're bigger. I like it because it is fast paced, full of swords and magic. This is especially true when Eragon fights a Shade, which is basically a possessed human. It's a fight between two skilled swordsmen/magic users, so it'll keep you on edge until the other is dead. This conquest over the Shade gains him the alias \\"Eragon Shadeslayer\\". That is why it is my favorite part."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The main ideas were new and interesting. The idea of finding an egg, the dragon choosing its partner were inspired. Some of the characters had some interesting features. Brom's knowledge of magic but not being a \\"master\\" magician was a good change, more real than the more common Tolkien or Brooks approach. On the other hand, the plot was entirely linear. The kid plods from one episode to another. There is nothing going on in parallel. Nothing unexpected or hidden secrets encountered. The book gets a bit slow. The final duel with the sorcerer was anticlimatic. I liked the link to the elfin magic user while the kid was in his delerium, so am going to give the second book a shot."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"A great read!I truly enjoyed reading this It's a rarity these days to find an author capable of such good storytelling.

It really is worth the trouble to read it is in my opinion beter than the Lord of the Rings series. The author uses lots of details when describing everything that happens to characters in the book. He makes them sound so real that you can see them and really get inside their heads. I think Christopher should hurry up and write the next book in the inheritance series. He is one of the best fantasy authors around and i think he has a long career ahead of him."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Good question, because most of us don't know what to expect when opening a book. If you were expecting adventure, love, pain, magic and the usual out of a fantasy book, then this book would greatly enhance your knowledge.But, instead, if you are not really interested in the above excerpts, then I'm afraid this book would not be worth your time in reading, for it is a long book taking much time and effort.I myself will never judge those outside of my knowledge, and what right would I have anyway, though the truth often comes out faster in bright colors than slower in the same expanse. This book, Eragon, will be famous among thousands, perhaps millions-for that is to see whether the next two books are as good in describing nature and other objects than the first.I, in reading, was shocked that only a 15 yr. old could come up with ideas such as these. Now, since age has finally taken a toll on young Paolini, I believe that his life will hold many secrets-both for the good and the bad.As for the title, Good book or Bad book?, it is for you to justly decide.

I guarntee it!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As I said above, the LOTR is the Lord of the Rings trilogy. People can say that Chris Paolini is following Tolkien's footsteps because Chris' Inheritance trilogy is can say, somehow similar to the LOTR trilogy, because the story is a type of epic (heroic type of story), and it contains a**-kicking wars, urgals, elves (no Orlando Bloom though lol), dwarfs, power-hungry empire (in LOTR's case, a darkness that want to gain country of Middle Earth) that wants to take control of Alageasia, the place where the story takes place, but there are no hobbits, for that would be copying. Anyway, Chris started writing this novel when he graduated high school at fifteen (isn't that amazing???) and started writing the first deubt novel of the Inheritance trilogy. He is currently twenty-one years old. The author of this book is young and talented, and has won my heart...okay I am a nerd!Anyway, let's focus on the story. This story, can be the next Harry Potter multi-millionair series, for the story is so tempting that you can't put the book down when it is time for you to go to sleep or school, or work. And you feel like you have to go and rush to Chris' house and tell him to hurry up on writing the next novel, the Eldest, when you finished reading the book. Anyway, main character and the story: Eragon, as many of you may have guessed, is the main character of the story. This story is basically a fantasy tale of the existance of dragons and riders where they are destinied to bring peace among the elves, dragons, and even human. Eragon, who is only a poor farm boy, discovered a dragon egg and soon went on to a advanture to hunt the Ra'zac, who killed his beloved family member (can't tell ya who, no spoilers), and soon went on the adventure to bring justice upon the evil emporer, Galbatorix, who is, in this case, a bad king, and a trouble-maker for the people that lives in Alageasia. There is also the Varden, who is in this case, the good guy, and the side that Eragon has to join in order for the people to bring peace. Will Eragon join them and defeat the powerful emporer? I don't know either, because is not in the first book, so I guess you and I have to find out.Opinion to the story: This story is better than the Lord of the Rings series, because, Chris doesn't spend so much time descriping flowers, and trees like Tolkien did, which is to my relief. Though the plot was kind of weak at first, because I was tryin to find out what is the point of Eragon traveling to these places, of course I know what he was after, but I thought the point was a bit weak, unlike Harry Potter, for example, book one of the HP series, Harry trying to find out what the heck Snapes up to, and Rowling actually builds up the detail about how Harry wanted to save the Sorcerer's stone, but in Eragon, the point is a bit weak. But then once some tragic happened (someone died okay?), the plot or theme grew stronger, and the destination point that Eragon has to reach became stronger, so I get to follow along what he was up to. Overall, this book is too short in my opinion, and it totally rocks, but of course, Harry Potter would still be my first choose, and it is better than LOTR, so if you like LOTR, and wanted to find something kind of similar, just go ahead and read this book, and if you like Harry Potter, you should try this out too! You just can't miss it, you have got to read it.Websites related to Eragon trilogy: www.alageasia.com, www.shurtugal.com**I am not any members of the websites, I am just a fan of them, and would like to share my interest. =P"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I tried reading this book becasue it was so popular and I wanted to see what all the hype was about.

I like the new takes on old ideas but the plot is really cliche and most of the charcters can be found in any fantasy novel. It is almost like a blueprint for fantasy novels.Of course the main character has parents that no one anything about, and that the main character has a great destiny before him. how many times have we heard this story? i mean come on the beginning chapters are almost straight out of Star Wars.The book looks cool but the story is anything but."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was great!

I feel very sorry for forced school kids sometimes. Google for 'famous homeschoolers' to see who else I am talking about.)But back to the book.

The writing style is fine, but has a big overload of unnecessary details. The characters are well shaped and fit into their class well. The storyline is well-shaped and seems to be well thought of beforehand. Not much suspense involved as the story is mostly predictable.I have mixed thoughts about reading 'Eldest', but I might give it a try. Hope it isnt worse....Rating: 5.6 / 10"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It was a well written book and fast paced.

I didn't know that the author was only fifteen when the book was written when I read the book. The story was about eregon ( ra not re) who finds a rock in the Spine. He tries to sell the rock without success. Era-go-n keeps the rock and it hatches. The rock was really a dragon egg. Era-go-n names the dragon Saphira( Saphira is my favorite character).Brom finds out about Saphira. When the evil king finds out about Saphira; he sends the ra'zac to find Era-gon and Saphira. Br-om helps them escape and the rest of the story is about their adventures."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is truly one of the better modern fantasy stories out there.

With great characters, an engaging story, and an awesome dragon, Eragon is a must-read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this when it came out a random find and loved it. The movie...not so much. I read all of the books faster than they were released and could not wait to see the adventure continue. This is truely the one that started it all. The first in the series is usually kinda slow with introductions and explainations of the landscape and people. Not the case here, the book moves swiftly and wraps the descriptive notes into the story to make the reader fellm a part of the book. One of my favorites. I have my 9 year old son reading it now, he is hooked ;)With that said there are some adult type violence in these books so parents take note."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"O.K.this book is the second best book i have ever read!(Next to Siverwing)While the action is gory and violent,this book is very wonderful.(is that right?very wonderful,hmmm...)Now, the basic story is this guy,Eragon,(ER-ah-gon)finds this egg,and it hatches,and a dragon comes out.Eventually,things happen, and Eragon is out to get revenge.The characters are great(Saphira is so cool!thats the name of my lizard.)and the story is simple enough to follow,yet complicated enough to not feel silly.Its pretty long,but youll love every second of it.P.S. the movie is coming out June 16 2006."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed the book tremendously. The story progress is much as expected but it still holds enough surprise to keep interest high. Its a must have for fantasy lovers.

Grab a copy sit back and just enjoy it for what it is an enchanting tale."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What would you do if you were hunting in the woods and found a mysterious stone? Would you keep it? This is what happens to a poor farm boy named Eragon. When no one buys it, he tries to discover what it is hiding. A dragon hatches and Eragon names the baby dragon Saphira. Eragon decides to go and tell the town story teller, Brom, about him being a Dragon Rider. Little did Eragon know, the Empire is looking for Saphira's egg, they come to Eragon's town and people and so Eragon sets out with Brom. He faces many hardships along the way and discovers that he will have to fight Galbatorix one day. This book genre is fantasy. My favorite character in this book is Saphira. She is my favorite character because she protects Eragon and can use magic. I think that this book is fantastic and is a quick read, once you pick this book up you will not be able to put it down until you finish it. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy. I would also suggest that you read Eldest the sequel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My 10 year old son turned to me and asked for this book. I encourage reading and since I saw nothing I would find objectionable, I purchased. My son, whom is addicted to video games, computers and T.V. would NOT put this book down. We were even on vacation in Las Vegas and all he could do was look for the book or it's sequel......I have since read it and I agree - it is an awesome read. The difficult part is the new places and languages but that is also the fun. You are forced to leave today behind you on this wonderful journey."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I admit, when I first looked at the cover of Eragon, I was disppointed. Every had said it was so good, but the summary on the inside flaps didn't excite me very much. But once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I had expected a boring account. But the story was filled with suspense and new twists in the plot. It kept me reading far past midnight on a school day.Those people who say Eragon is like Star Wars, What are you thinking?Eragon is not like any of the fantasies we've all read. Yes, some ideas were taken from them, but doesn't it create a new tale? If you take two patchwork quilts apart, mix up the patches, and reassemble the mixed patches, you get two quilts that look compeltely different from the original two.I highly reccommend this book to you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of my favorite books as a fan of fantasy. It starts off in a bang, when a strange blue stone appears in a blast of fire as Eragon is hunting for his family. 15-year-old Eragon lives with his poor cousin and uncle with an unknown father and disappeared mother. He takes the stone home to sell and find its worth. The stone, or egg, hatches into a blue dragon, a supposedly extinct creature. As a result, the evil King Galbitrorix had his followers chase Eragon down to get the dragon named Saphira. Eragon bonds with Saphira, or becomes her rider. The Ra'zac destroy Eragon's home and uncle after his cousin leaves to work in the city. Eragon leaves Carvahall with the old storyteller Brom and the dragon Saphira. They travel through many cities and my favorite is Teirm where they meet Angela the herbalist and witch and Solemnbum the werecat. Eragon, Saphira, and Brom are trying to get to Dras-Leona, the place where the Ra'zac live to avenge Eragon's uncle's death. Will they make it to Dras-Leona? Will they destroy the Ra'zac? Will they find the strange maiden Eragon has seen in his dreams? Will everyone survive? Will they join and find the Varden, an outlaw group against Galbitrorix? A bit overwhelming at first, but then you get really into it. Sure Paolini copies other writers, but Eragon is one of the best books around for people who like Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, and books that are inches thick. Get it now, fantasy lovers!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I always feel sheepish checking out books from the young adult section at the library. However, I am usually rewarded with books like The Last Unicorn, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia. After much publicity, I picked up Eragon out of the young adult section hoping for another jewel. Unfortunately, this book does not live up to its hype for it is definitely more suited for young adults. The writing is uncomplicated and lengthy . . . epic proportions without an epic storyline. Paolini's characters are great but the story feels too long and gets rather dull in parts. This isn't a bad book, its just not a great book. I would recomend reading it though, just because the next installment (Eldest)is a fairly good read. The juvinielle feel of Eragon leads way to a more mature Eldest. My hope is that Paolini continues to grow in his third novel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Miss Lenza says Eragon is a promising first novel filled with enough excitement and adventure to keep you enthralled for hours. Vlad says Eragon kicks, smashes, cuts, *** etc. butt. Katrina and Victoria say that Eragon is a very well thought out book and we think that everybody should read it. Michael says 276 pages into the book just to see my favorite character die--what a waste of my time. Regardless of that situation, I still think it kicks......wheeee. Eragon portrays a great sense of great literature. Also Roran should die--we don't like him. Ms. Paradis says it is obvious that Christopher Paolini has read EVERY major fantasy book available and has taken the plots, characters etc. from them all and has written a very satisfying book for those who want more Harry Potter, King Arthur, Frodo, Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund, on and on....From the Plympton School Grade 5 Wicked Smart Book Club"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have never been into reading much at all. I was at the local book store and saw the book looked at the back cover and read the print on it. I found it of intrest so i bought it. I started reading it and i could not stop! It was a Shame that i had to go to work. I found the story line to be very intense and full of thought.As well as descriptive. I read the book within a couple of days and then orderd Eldest from amazon. I can't wait to see what happens next. This author although young has a gift to make a reader out of anyone. I am 22 years old, and in aww. I highly recomend this book to anyone regardless of age."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was skeptical about reading this book at first, but the story line became more addicting as the book went on. The author used ideas and concepts from the Harry Potter series, Dragon Riders of Pern series, and the Lord of the Ring series. He mixed them together, and out came this book. There were times when I thought the story line was a bit choppy, but it was still a good read. I do plan on reading the next book in the series. I believe Christopher will become a better writer as time goes on."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is possible to work within a genre and follow it's conventions and still be original. It's possible to emulate the greats without recycling their ideas into thinly disguised, poorly drawn copies. Many fantasy writers have done this, but Paolini has not. Other reviewers have pointed out the specific instances of literary grand-larceny (and there are a lot) so I won't do that here. I will just say that I enjoyed the first few pages of Eragon before becoming first amused, then annoyed, then incredulous at how badly written this book is, and how full of others' ideas. Some reviewers have noted that this novel might be good for readers too young for Tolkein, but I disagree. This book could well spoil Tolkein for those readers. It's almost like reading a condensed version written by a hack without skill or integrity. Or, as another reviewer noted, like mediocre fan fiction. I award the book one star partly because I have to, but also because it has been a treasure trove of errors to point out to my children. It is also a very good example of plagiarism. The adult critics who have failed to pan this book should be ashamed. Young people deserve good literature, or at least honest trash. This is neither."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini has a fabulous story in the Inheritance series, and Eragon is largely devoted to setting up questions that are to follow the reader through the later books. While Eragon does drag in a few places, I liked it well enough to read the later books, and this is an excellent series. If you enjoy fantasy like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, or Harry Potter, these books will be right up your alley."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The premise of this story is very alluring. A young ,seemingly, ordinary boy stumbles upon a beautiful stone that turns out to be his destiny. I am a big fan of fantasy and there was a lot of hype surrounding this book. The fact that the writer was a teenager when he penned it does bring a certain amount of admiration. Unfortunatly, as others have been quick to point out, it borrows from other better novels of this genre. Perhaps I would be willing to overlook even that if it had not been for the blandness of the story. The reader isn't intimatly introduced to Eragon. We aren't held witness to his likes and dislikes. There is just zero character develoment. How are we supposed to care about what happens to them if they are one dimensional and bland?This is one of the few books I just couldn't finish. I have roughly four chapters left. I knew there was a big problem when I found myself skipping ahead and just wanting to finish. It would be interesting to know if the writing improves in the later books. Sadly, I can say that I won't be finding out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon's story is basically a Star Wars narrative set in a Tolkien fantasy world, while ripping off other fantasy elements from other works (and I'm only a very casual fantasy reader).Indeed, Eragon is so lacking in originality that it is remarkably predictable; I ended up predicting almost all the plot twists, including the end of book two - before I even finished book one (just add the Star Wars like narrative with Eragon's accurate, not-ambiguous-enough Prophecy scene and you can figure out the rest).Eragon's success lies partly with its hype but mostly with the public's (mostly the youngsters) apetite for fantasy, which has escalated thanks to Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings films.While many may think Eragon is impressive for a 19 year old, it really isn't once you're aware of the multitude of teen fantasy nerds writing their own fantasy epics - two of my friends are among them, and you can find their works on the internet (granted, most of them are utter garbage, but the better works are as bad as Eragon). The only reason Eragon got published while being so unpolished is because his parents own a publishing company.All in all, Eragon isn't terrible, just lengthy, mildly entertaining fluff for those who like anything fantasy and have time to kill."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I picked this up for a nice break after reading quite a bit of informative non-fiction, knowing that a children's phenomenon would probably be a fun read. And I have absolutely no bias against the children's section; I love it, and think Harry Potter needs to be on the regular best-seller lists. Unfortunately, this one disappoints. Ugh. I struggled to finish.If you think this is a great read, then congratulations on finding the fantasy genre. You can definitely find better, everywhere. I don't mind the lack of originality that most people harp on. At least the tried-and-true plotlines make the story move (thus two stars). But the dialogue sounds like people talk in essay format. I get that Paolini is young, so let's wait until he learns to write and then praise him. After all, youth isn't a literary quality; it's an excuse for lack thereof."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ok, I'm not quick to jump on the bandwagon for anything; which is why after hearing of the criticism of Eragon, I still decided to give it a go. However, the simillarities between this book and the first \\"Star Wars\\" film were so blatantly obvious, it was hard to come to any other conclusion, other than that Christopher Paolini has realised that, with a little plagiarism, he can cash in on the market with no real thought or imagination required.So, if no one has noticed the quite unmissable simillarities between Star Wars and Eragon, I thought I'd spell a few out for you. Eragon is a simple farm boy, living in a remote village with his uncle (Wait, didn't luke skywalker do that?). There is a cruel empire that Luke, OOOPS, Eragon and his people dispise (Same in Star Wars, wasn't it?). Then, a curious old man arrives on the scene, and teaches Eragon all kinds of secrets that will help conquer the empire (Okay, in star wars it was about Jedi forces, in this it was about dragons, but the same idea, right?). When Eragon discovers a dragon in his village, the empire are quick to react, and one day whan Eragon is away with his dragon, he finds that the empire have murdered his uncle (Same in star wars, was it not?). Seeing that he has nothing left to stay for, Eragon and his dragon go on a magical journey with the curious old man to defeat the empire. 'Nough said.So, no original story line; in regards to other issues, the book is very well written, with some quite momorable dialogue (EG \\"The mind is man's last sanctuary.\\") Character development is existant as well, although the bond between Eragon and Brom (old man) is all to familiar if you've heard of Frodo and Gandalf. The Dragon, Saphire is a very likeable character, and she is described in a way that makes her quite believable. But for me, there are too many cliches in this book to keep me entertained; if you are looking for effective teen fantasy with a deep meaning, I would reccomend David Clements Davies's \\"The Sight\\". While this book may keep young children entertained with large monsters and action packed battles, a reader of fantasy and Sci Fi greats will, after Fifty pages, have \\"I've heard all this before\\" ringing in their heads for the remainder of the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I bought this, I was looking for something to fill my fantasy void (especially in Audio CDs).

I picked it up while I was waiting impatiently for my Harry Potter book. This is an amazing story!

I would highly recommend this book to anyone!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This story steals from many classics. I suppose it isn't an exact ripoff but the similarities between this and other classics such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and so on are so pitifully obvious. I read this to my kids and certainly they enjoyed it, not recognizing the plots, ideas and so on. I also don't think it was well written, there is never any doubt that Eragon will make it and be just fine. The dialogue is pretty bad.I can only give it two stars and that's because the kids did like it. Taken for what it is, a kids book, it is okay but just barely. It's the plagiarism that is so obvious and sickening. I think he made enough changes for it all to be legal, but it is still pretty pathetic.Kids read this instead :The Hobbit"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Has someone ever given you a book you just can't find time to read? That happened to me with \\"Eragon\\". I liked the story, as summed up in the cover, but a lot of the reviews I had previously read about it were awful, mostly criticizing the style of its author, Christopher Paolini, or saying that this book was just an imitation of others, for example the books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series.I must confess that I let those spiteful comments get to me, and I always found something else to read before tackling \\"Eragon\\". That is, until I watched the movie, loosely based on the book of the same name I'm reviewing right now. It wasn't spectacular, but it had something special that made you care for Eragon, a young man like many others that ends up discovering a dragon's egg, and changing his destiny and that of Alagaesia.\\"Eragon\\", the film, was a good introduction to Paolini's world, a world of magic and dragons, elves and strange creatures. All the same, I wanted more, so I went straight to the source. I picked up the book that had been waiting patiently for me and started reading. I read it in a day, without stopping, enjoying the fact that Paolini's story was much, much better than what the film had allowed me to glimpse, and that I was on holidays and could allow myself the luxury of reading the whole book without having to stop and go to work :)Now, I can say that I loved \\"Eragon\\", and can recommend it to others without doubts. This book is not slow, it just allows you to understand the characters. There is action, but also people that talk, and I think the result is balanced, and beautiful. I've read \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and I also liked it a lot, but that series is very different to this one. I guess those who disliked this book so intensely weren't reading the same book, or were reading it with other eyes. Worse for them, I suppose.This is the kind of book that gives your imagination wings, and makes you part of the story. Truth to be told, I enjoyed learning about Eragon, Saphira and their friends, and I thank Christopher Paolini for that. Some people say that \\"it is better late than never\\", and I think that applies to me and this book. What about you?Belen AlcatPS: Reading \\"Eragon\\" has only a small drawback... There is no way you will be able to stop reading about Eragon's adventures here, so just make yourself a favour and buy both \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" (the sequel) at the same time? It's cheaper, and it will save you some time :)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I saw Eragon on the New York Times Bestseller list, and I'll admit I was kind of skeptical about reading it, because there have been many fantasy novels out lately that are all the same exact thing.

I went out and bought it that night, and read the entire thing until I finished at about 4:00 in the morning. It was a great action packed fantasy. I also couldn't believe when I saw that Christopher Paolini was only 19 years old when he wrote Eragon. He is an inspiration to young, aspiring writers. I cannot wait until the next installment of the Inheritance Series (Elder) is released. There is room for a few improvements, such as cutting back on some big words that didn't even make sense in some parts, and some of the characters and ideas sound familiar from other fantasy movies and books, but it is still worth reading.

More than anything it's a salute to these great staples of the genre.Of course, this being what it is we already know he'll overthrow the Neroesque emperor and be hailed as a messiah somewhere in book 3. Actually, by The end of THIS BOOK he's hailed as a messiah, in a manner reminiscent either of Paul Atreides in Dune or that Iraqi terrorist ye keep hearing about in the news.As for the characters Eragon is basically a young Batman-minus the costume-, Brom Obi-Wan Kenobi,and Arya the generic warrior woman. The only truly CREATIVE characters were Saphira the dragon, fiery and overprotective of her rider Eragon. She nearly seems like a human being rather than a dragon.And of course Angela the witch, who occasionaly shows up to help Eragon in his quest for revenge and eventually to aid the Varden terrorist organization against the empire.An intriguing read, nothing new, but it's fun to note the resemblances to other stuff."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon', Christopher Paolini's debut novel (and the first in the Inheritance Trilogy), is a fantasy that's bound to attract a few Tolkien fans, especially those whose minds began to wander after a page or two of elvish lyric. The basic story revolves around the uprising of the elves, dwarves and human serfs in the kingdom of Alagaesia. As in most 'good vs. evil plots', the good are multifaceted and fractioned, and the evil is pure, malevolent and past the point of redemption. You probably won't add any new words to your vocabulary but you might be sickly aroused by the adolescent crush descriptions (he's a 15 year old boy you perv) as Eragon begins to come into puberty and lusts for an interracial/species roll in the hay. The main characters spend a greater portion of the novel developing, which is a good thing (think Arthur C. Clarke's 'Rama') and therefore the action is delayed in lieu of build-up. Battle scenes have an unpleasant habit of being cut short as the protagonist spent more time on his back in fights than Kelly Bundy did on dates. Overall, Eragon is an entertaining read, so dredge up that harbored regret about not accomplishing anything before you turned 18, unlike Mr. Paolini who graduated high school at 15 to write a novel that hit the best sellers list."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is the BEST story i have ever read in my life!!(11 years!)Everyone should read this great adventure book, yes, even the adults!

I had trouble putting 'Eragon' down!!(^_____^)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Some say that this book is not worth reading because is has parts relating to other books (mainly LOTR), and i agree, this book dose relate to LoTR. THe whole history of the land is the same as that of Middle-Earth with the elves coming to this land from sea, the dwarves hiding in their great mountain-halls, with the who country being thretend by an evil mastermind who had betrayed everyone, and last of all the one perosn who if became who they were born to be could put and end to it all, Eragon becoming a Rider and Aragorn Becoming king of Gondor. But to me that is just one of the aspects that make this book what it is, a true clasic.So yes i belive that this book has many borrowed themes, but personaly i loved the lord of the rings series because of the way it was writen and the sceans that it created, and this is what makes a worth while book its kind of another perspective on what could have happend in that story. Now im only 15 and i know that when i read a book i will sistimaticly change things is my head of what i thought should have happend.I say that chris has got him self a classic that should be widly read and openly criticed, because with criticsm this book will become a ledgend as Lord of the Rings has.And to all of those of u who think that because it is a bad book because it has borrowed themes, chew on this - If Eragon can mimic LoTR's story play why cant it mimic its succes?Good Luck Chris."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is predictable to a extent, especially if your familar with Tolkeins work and with The Dragonriders of Pern.

He did not critique the book, as many of the reviewers have. He just enjoyed it, as it should be. This book is not a \\"literary masterpiece\\", but it serves it's purpose well. Paolini gives the kids what they want...a hero, a dragon to wish for, and an exciting storyline...who cares if it's been \\"done\\". My son would argue against any critique, and so would I.

There's little originality in Eragon's universe.Is the prose below the level of Tolkien? Obviously. It is on par with Robert Jordan, which I think is decent enough, as Eragon is merely another fantasy novel and not an epic work.Is the plot completely and utterly predictable? It is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune-telling early on.But is it entertaining? Yes!If you can settle for the penultimate.. if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure, even if it wasn't written by an Oxford scholar... then you will love Eragon. It is not /Lord of the Rings/-- it is /Harry Potter/."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"...I wanted to read Eragon so much I didn't want to put it down to do my homework.

All of my friends think I am nuts for reading costently and not playing, but they haven't read it. I could only say that a few books are equally good. When you read Eragon, in the middle you find yourself in suspenion and can't get out of it until the very end. I hope Eldest comes out soon! [Meanig in the next few days!] I was shocked at times, wishing the next event would have been more surprising at others. I thought it was cool that there was a glossery in the back!

I'm keeping this book. I'm waiting unpatiently for Elder book 2 in the trilogy. I can't stand books that have too much detail because I fall asleep zzzzz. I think the author puts enough detail in the book perfectly (especially since it's in the kid section). A few of the other viewers say that this book \\"has been done\\" before, but don't all books remind someone else of another book they've read? It's the way the author tells the tale which counts and I think he did very well. You really can't go off of what I say though or what the other reviewers say, for many of us have different opinions.

Although, as others have stated, it has taken ideas from other authors. First off, the dragons, and dragon riders, just like the Pern series. Then all the characters and races are pretty much taken from Tolkien's LOTR series. And the magic, its entire basis seems to come word for word from Ursula K. Leguin's Wizard of Earthsea series. Although she probably based it on ancient myth's and legends of our world.

Eragon by Christopher Paolini is a great read. It is amazing to realize that this story was written by a teenager. Paolini pays homage to some of the great fantasy writers, and it is fun to catch the subtle (or not so subtle) tributes that he pays to the great ones. The mark on the palm, for example, brings to mind Garion of the Belgariad, by David Eddings. Tolkien, McCaffrey - you will find a bit of them in Eragon as well. While others may criticize this - I found the story compelling and extremely well-written. The tributes were a bonus. I look forward to more from Paolini, and hey - maybe I will finish my book someday too!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is great.

In the final book Arya gets a green dragon and names him firnen eragon also goes to the island of the riders and gets more eggs and eldunari and eragon father is brom not morzan. Eragon gets a sword from rhunon and names it brisingr and he does leave alagaseia forever.

There are several Spiritual Lessons contained in it if you have the eyes to see them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Spoilers!People have been saying over and over again how very unoriginal this writing is. Never have finished the Lord of the Rings (finding one of the most boring things I've ever read.), and I haven't read the Star Wars books, I really can't tell you if this is really plagiarism. I have read the reviews that compare Star Wars to Eragon, and I admit, they do have some merit. But there are still a lot of original ideas in this book, and it is one of the better dragon books out there. And if it is just like the Lord of the Rings, I give Christopher Paolini a thumbs up for managing to make it interesting.The story line was good, and there were a couple of laughs along the way. I was sad when Brom died, but happy when Eragon rescued Arya. Arya turned out to be my favorite character, and the most mysterious. Saphira was done well, giving her enough traits to not sound like she had the mind of a human. Overall, I would have to say that the characters were all well done.I will say this though, the book could have a third less chapters and you wouldn't notice the difference. Too many pages, and too much time is spent on descriptions of every little thought, action, and scenery change. And while I love long books, I will only like them if it keeps you captivated. It is also a little bit gory, with lots of wars and battles, it's to be expected, and should delight teenage boys.For boys I would say this is 10 and up, for girls I would say 12 and up. I liked it quite a bit, but it could have been a lot better in my opinion. Another thing that really got me was the ending. There was nothing that gave you the happy, contented feeling of just having finished a good book. Instead it was like the story line was fading into the distance, almost like an unfinished thought.This is the type of book you can read several times, but with a very long distance between the readings. I would still place it on my top 10 favorite series list, but it would be in place #10."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book is great reading.

An exiled mentor (Star Wars), Dragon/rider imprinting (Dragonriders of Pern), Elves (Lord of the Rings), Magic (The Wizard of Earthsea) are among several I can think of. Other than his one concept that a person should always make up their own mind, which I appreciated, I think he overall failed to add a different perspective, or unique vision to the realm of fantasy.What I find ironic is the indignance of reviewers who complain about the movie's failure in retelling the story. I will save the remaining books and the DVD for the library."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First I will write a review, then I shall constructively be a credic of all the negative reviews.The book is great. Unlike others I believe the plot is for th most part quite original. Paolini does a great job of keeping the story interesting through the whole book, also does a good job of the steady maturing of Eragon.I have read other reviews that say Paolini copied Tolkien, George Lucas etc..However I do not agree with this. One, there are many rags-to-riches characters in stories and that does not mean any of them copy any of the others. Does Eregon resemble Skywalker? Maybe a little bit, but that does not mean he copied the idea. Tolkien, if you remember was a scholar of lore, an expert of Celtic mythology. So if you like to take it that far , Tolkien stole his idea from the Celts. So so what if Paolini stole his idea of Celtic mythology from Tolkien? Tolkien was an expert so it would be safe to trust his ideas.One last thing. As I'm sure everybody critizing has taken a literature course, you will remember that \\"The Leatherstocking Tales\\" was considered the basis of all American heros. Including Huck Finn(though Twain would likely deny it)etc.. So are all American novels stole from Cooper(Author of the Leatherstocking Tales)?SummaryEragon is as original as any other novel. If it is not original than that does not make it automatically a bad story. Paolini has combined his ideas with some of the best traditional ideas to create a great novel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While filled with Fantasy Clich&eacute;s Paolini is able to build sympathetic characters we care about. His characters are complex enough for adult readers without being too complex for younger readers. Although some of his segments drag they are few and far between and do not negatively affect the plot. If you find yourself bogged down feel free to skim a bit. In my opinion this is one of the better-written fantasy novels of the last five years. Surprising when you find it was written by a teen. Based on raw talent expect Paolini to be a force for years to come as his style, creativity and life experience mature."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm surprised that nobody was ever told to use the force."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I found Eragon to be a very basic, bare-bones fantasy story. The way I see it, the basic structure of a fantasy plot is like a skeleton and it is the author's job to give those bones flesh. However, Paolini failed to do this and his book is the perfect example of a stereotypical fantasy. It seems as if Paolini was writing Eragon the way he thought it SHOULD be written rather than letting himself write his own story. This book might be useful as a first-timer's introduction to fantasy but as an actual work of literature, it's just not good."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Not, however, a great novel. It's quality stuff that I'd expect to read on an Internet forum somewhere, but I'm unhappy that I paid money for it in book form.If I wanted to read Tolkien's and LeGuin's stories, I would have gone straight to their books. If I wanted to read an impressive book from a teenage author, I'd have opened up \\"The Neon Bible\\" by John Kennedy Toole again. \\"Eragon\\" isn't the first choice in any of these categories, though.I admire the young writer for his discipline in pumping out books of such length. My second star is for that talent. It's a sign that he has a long writing career ahead of him. Like other reviewers have said, I'll check him out again in a decade or so when he starts writing his own things instead of fan-fiction paeans to his favorite writers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon was entertaining enough, but that's the only thing it's got going for it. It's not the kind of book that people will remember for years.

It's just a combination of different books. I saw more Tokien, McCaffrey, and LeGuin than Paolini in this book.

Now, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan, but I am an avid Le Guin, Alexander, Weis, and De Lint fan. I can see where he got the dragon riders from (Pern), but it was Eragon's concept of magic that PISSED me off.The concept of magic is EXACTLY THE SAME in Earthsea as it is in Eragon! Only, Ms. Le Guin expresses her creation intelligently, clearly, and well-thoughtout, while 'Master' Paolini describes it through confusing dialogue.May Earthsea Live Forever!And that is my review,Ta'ta!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think that this book was very well writen dispite what some people think.

I liked the book because I thought that the characters were interesting and the story line was intriging. I'm not going to say it has no flaws but every book has a few flaws - no exeptions.

I really did. But, as a lover of books, I decided that this story was not for me. The author is obviously an amateur, and would do very well in a high school English class. However, his home-school background shows through the flaking veneer of this unrelatable book. His sentence structure is amazingly halted, unable to flow like a quality piece of literature. Making my attempt to read this book all the less enjoyable is the author's precocious vocabulary, needless proper names and jargon, and endless simile and metaphor that fills the pages.

Said egg hatches and the two are bonded. Adventures ensue.A critic above described this book as 'a comfy old sweater' and I think that description really hit the nail on the head. This book won't change your life or introduce you to a fresh new fantasy world... but it will probably entertain you, and at the end of the day that's the goal of most novels.To start with the bad:No surprises in this book - this was your typical and predictable, Joseph Campbell-esque Hero's Quest. The odd birth, journey, mentor, adversities, etc. There were definitely moments when the writer's age was glaringly obvious. At times he borrowed a little too much from other writers (Tolkein was there, but I noticed a heavy influence of McCaffrey and Jordan even more... Uruks became Urguls, Warders became Wardens, Shades became... Shades. Damn! He was too lazy to even change a letter for that one.) The dialog was pretty rigid in spots... the illiterate farmer spoke like a scholar, saying things along the lines of (and these are my own words): \\"I never imagined the sheer immensity of these magnificent, ivory peaked mountains. Perhaps if I could read I would have studied them in an ancient tome of legend and lore. Thrusgyf dunnie! How shall we ever gauge the distance remaining and be sure our noble steeds do not become overly fatigued from this arduous and daunting journey?!\\" And lastly, I didn't like having to check the glossary every time he used some phrase from his conlang (which was often)... so to him I say: Frthisngr! Uath tuaka iksdhf 98ewnsku!1! (Trans: Next time use English.)But then there's the good:Despite the way the above sounds, I did like the book. It was a no-brainer, didn't drag, and there were some very impressive passages mixed into the kiddie-stuff. I was probably most impressed by the amount of research this kid must have done. He described weaponry and its uses in beautiful detail, and though his setting description was sometimes lacking, the scenes toward the end of the book were superbly painted.Long story short, I'm going to buy Eldest, Eragon's sequel, but probably get it used or wait for paperback. Also, just FYI, Eragon will be in a theatre near you next year, starring John Malkovich (who the hell will he be?) and Jeremy Irons (my guess is the mentor).

The potential for the future is even greaterOne of the main draws of fantasy for me is being drawn into a new and exciting world. Fantasy provides a forum for authors to deal with ideas, traditions, and imagination that no other genre can. And if there is a king of fantasy, it's Tolkien. Many dispute whether Paolini was trying to be Tolkien, or what Tolkien would think of this novel, which is completely irrelevent to Eragon the book.Paolini set out to write a traditional \\"hero's journey\\" and he did that. Yes, as a young and inexperienced some of the dialogue and character developement will be a bit clunky. But he started this at 15, 15! Of course he must start out drawing from previous writers ergo the \\"hero's journey\\". Even in this first book, the growth in writing skill and technical developement is immense!Eragon succesfully drew me in and created a new world with interesting characters. But I think the most important thing about Eragon is its potential. Paolini started out with the tried and true fantasy blue print, but I think he will grow even more as an author and provide years of quality fantasy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought Eragon was a great fantasy.

The suspense and wizardry and wonderful dive into the elvin realm was enough to wet my palet. The only disappoibtment for me was in knowing that I must now wait patiently for book two.

It did seem to draw heavily on other books, but with all the fantastic fantasy books out there if you've read any of them its hard not to at least include elements from them. The story flowed relatively smoothly and kept me wanting to know what happened next.

There, the descriptions of the characters/species introduced seemed painfully familiar - I'd just re-read the splendid works of J.R.R. Tolkien in preparation for the release of Return of the King, and seeing characters that seemed almost exactly like Tolkien's characters in another story didn't impress upon me as a fantastic way to start the book. But I decided that I could just chalk it down to the fact that Mr. Paolini has simply been largely influenced by Tolkien. So I continued through the book, but by the time I'd made it to the tenth page, I still hadn't been as enthralled by the book as I have by other young authors (most notably by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, whose works have also been acclaimed, whose latest - Hawksong - I would recommend. If you read the rest of her books, you will see the progression her writing has made throughout the years.). I struggled with Mr. Paolini's writing (which is very rare, as I've been a voracious reader from a young age, and from the classics to more contemporary works, I can absorb anything, as long as it's well written and engaging), which for some reason struck me as stiff and artificial.Regardless, I will try to finish this book, and from several interviews I've read about Mr. Paolini, he seems to be a very intelligent young man who I just think needs to find the words and let it flow. I'm hoping his next story in this trilogy, Eldest, will display a growth in his writing style, as when he wrote Eragon, he was 15 and might've been too focused on being proper.I hope to see better works from him - he might be a promising writer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I started reading this book in the car during our Thanksgiving trip and continued reading it until I finished it once we arrived.

Also, I did find myself thinking \\"This is too much like Lord of the Rings.\\" There are Elves and Dwarves but something different are the Dragon-riders and this is probably the most interesting part of the book.Paolini spends a lot of time describing the intimate relationship the main character, Eragon, has with his dragon, Saphira. To some extent Eragon doesn't feel fully developed as a character. True, he's only 16-year-old and is still in the midst of developing but it's somewhat confusing for the reader. To be completely honest, the thing I liked most about the book was flipping to the map on the inside cover, following Eragon's travels.This author can only get better with time. I'd be interested to read the next two in the trilogy. In the meantime, I highly recommend The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 1: The Amulet of Samarkand. I couldn't put this book down. It's original, funny and not that many people seem to know about it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wow,the book is great!It is very surprising that how Christopher Paolini could write such a great book at 15.Eragon's adventures are simply mind blowing.Reading this book will be much better than playing video games.Paolini has dreamt of a world that none of us has ever done. The country of Alagesia,Eragon,Saphira the dragon,Brom,Garrow,Roran,Arya,the Urgals,Shade Durza,Dwarves, Murtagh,Jeod and of course,the evil king Galbatorix are the perfect characters.Some reviewrs had said that the names were very hard to remember.But I think it's pretty easy.The magical words,the ancient language etc.are totally different from Harry Potter.The sword fights make you feel like you are there.It's a great fantasy and adventiorus book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is simply amazing - the fact that the author is a teenager has nothing to do with it - it's a fantasy masterpiece. An inspiration to all young people who wish become authors, Eragon is a milestone in fantasy history. One of these young authors myself, I thought that Paolini's work was mindblowing. I wont explain the plot of the novel for if you wish to know what it is, read Amazon's other reviews.Eagerly awaiting Eldest, book two of the Inheritence Trilogy, I enjoy Paolini's work as much as I loved Harry Potter and the Dragonlance Chronicles."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great book. Written well, especially by someone so new to the writing business. He clearly has talent, and the book is well written. The book may have a resemblance to other famous works, but the way that all of these elements go together in Eragon keeps readers reading long after dark.It has all of the elements essential to a good book, humor, adventure, mystery, and even a little romance. The story tells of a boy, just old enough to realize that there is more to life than just his little home.Eragon has many adventures, and the story is long, yet not too long. As I finished the last pages of the book I found myself wishing I hadn't read it so fast.All in all, this book is well worth the read, with a good plot for people of all ages. I will eagerly be awaiting Eldest, book two."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I honestly haven't read this book - I bought it for my wife.

WARNING!!!>A young boy named Eragon, raised by his Uncle Garrow and Aunt Marian in the land of Alagaesia, where the evil King Galbatorix lords over the land, finds a saphire colored egg and thinks it is some sort of valuable stone. He tries to sell it, but it ends out hatching, and revealing a small dragon inside.Eragon raises the dragon, and gleans information about them from Brom, the village's storyteller. He gives his female dragon the name 'Saphira', from a dragon name that Brom gives him.Soon, evil beings called the Ra'zac come to Eragon's village, and murder his uncle Garrow (his cousin Roran being somewhere else, and his aunt having died years before), leaving Eragon with a heavy thirst for revenge.Brom finds Eragon and Saphira, says he knows about dragons, and insists that he allow him to train Eragon, so he might live though his quest to kill the Ra'zac. Eragon agrees, and him and Brom and Saphira leave, for the Ra'zac are leaving, and the trio don't want to lose them.After dropping off at a massacered village, having Eragon's fortune told by Angela, and getting information from Jeod, a wealthy merchant and an old friend of Brom's, they try to find out the Ra'zac's hiding place, which leads to them fleeing for their lives from Hellegrid.While on the run from Ra'zac, they get attacked, and Brom is wounded. A young man named Murtagh rescues Eragon and Saphira, and offers to help them with their quest. They reach a hidden cave, where Brom wakes up and tells Eragon he was a Dragon Rider, and that his dragon, Saphira, was killed by the traitor Morzan. He then dies, leaving Eragon heartbroken.Shortly after they get captured, and Eragon meets Duraz, a evil Shade that is intent on learning Eragon's true name (learning the true name of a person will allow anyone control over a person). With a little bit of luck, Eragon and Murtagh escape to join Saphira, rescuing a elf woman in the process.When they reach safty, Eragon heals her, and finds out from her mind the way to the Varden, and that she must have medicine from them is she wants to be healed. They journey there, where and Saphira discover that Murtagh is Morzan's son, (Morzan being the traitor Dragon Rider that allied with Galbatorix, the evil king of Alagaesia, to kill the rest of the Dragon Riders and in doing so killed all the dragons that did not escape Alagaesia), and ally themselves to the Varden.A battle is waged, and Eragon and Saphira must fight against the Shade Duraz, or die in the process...&lt;SPOILERS END HERE>All together, a great book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think that this book is great.

But once the stone brings a dragon named Saphira his life is all turned around.Overnight one day his uncle Garrow was killed by the Ra'zac, and he sets out with the help of a old storyteller named Brom to hopefully find and destroy the Ra'zac. Together they adventure into cities gathering information about the Ra'zac. They eventually find the Ra'zac in the city called Dras-Leona. But instead of chasing them they find themselves outnumbered and is forced to run away. After they reach the outskirts of the city they find themselves caught and tied up by the Ra'zac. Before the Ra'zac was about to kill the two adventures a mysterious stranger rescues them. In a last effort to kill Eragon the Ra'zac throw a spear at him, but Brom took the blow and died the next day.Now Eragon travels with his new companion Murtagh to the town of Gil'lead and get themselves captured by the mighty urgals. In prison Eragon finds an elf named Arya. He helps break her out a jail and regroups with Murtagh, but at the end he comes face to face with a shade named Durza.Together they kill him for now.They adventure past the Hadrac desert and finally come up to the great Beor Mountains. They find a city underground and find out that this was part of the Varden, a group of rebels fighting against the empire.At the end the leader named Ajihad finds out that the empire has put a full scale attack on the city. Everyone gets ready as the sound of tumbling feet approaches the city entrance tunnels. Then the carnage starts going up and soon Eragon finds him face to face with Durza again. This time Eragon had no help and was forced to use his best skills in swordsmanship. Everything changed once Saphira distracted Durza. Eragon lunged toward him and stabbed him the heart. Once this happen the whole entire Urgal army retreats and the battle is over.This book is a really good book and I recommend this book for people who like magic, dragons, and adventures from grades 5th to 8th.

If you enjoyed The Lord of The Rings trilogy, but felt the language in the books was hard to get through, or hard to read, this is your perfect book. With the same fee, and the same sense of adventure and finding of self, this book is well written and much easier to read, (although can be 'cringe-worthy' in some corny places) :) but still fantastic, and a good mix of fantasy, adventure, dreams, mystery and challenges. All characters in this book are well thought-out and interesting and all have specific traits.Christopher Paolini is only young, and he gets better with every chapter across each book. Eldest (the second one after Eragon) is so gripping I coudln't put it down - it was leaps and bounds ahead of Eraon language wise - yet it was one of those books that you didn't really want to finish in a rush because once it's over you feel a bit sad! :) Definitely give this book a look-in!

Without knowing it, he is chosen by Saphira (his dragon) whilst she is still in her egg to be the next great Dragonrider. This completely launches his life from that of a simple farm boy into a grand adventure of exploration, battle, grief, and turmoil. The story itself is very nicely written and easy to follow and understand. It is one of the books that just grab you and make you not want to place it down. Upon finishing the book I could not resist the urge to go out and purchase Eldest, the sequel to Eragon.

Eragon, his dragon, Saphira, and Brom the storyteller set of to take Eragon's revenge on the Ra'zac and to fight an evil king. Eragon continues to change and grow stronger until a desperate change of events forces him to flee to the Varden, a group of warriors who rebel against King Galbatorix, where he will fight in one of the greatest battles of Alagaesia.I recommend this book because it was a really great book that held my interest. This book was a page-turner because with each chapter new twists and turns were added to the plot or there were new battle scenes that could go on for chapters. There were lots of surprises in this story that I never expected, one was when Eragon finds out the storyteller, Brom, he was traveling with was a Dragon Rider before his dragon was killed.

She is wiser than Eragon and more intersting.Also because the original cover art showed the title as Eragon and then showed a dragon's head, I keep forgetting that Eragon is not the dragon's name, but the name of the uber-youth.By the way, I am way way over the age of 13."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While I am no book critic, I will say that I highly enjoyed this book, and began to re-read it almost as soon as I finished it. Despite the bad reviews some people gave it (which mostly reveal a certain jealousy at the thought of a teenager writing a successful book) I decided to give the book a try, and I'm glad I did. I couldn't put it down, and enjoyed both the story and the characters, which in my opinion are very likeable and very human: all of them have their own background story, flaws and virtues and powerful motives for their actions, even the villians. I also sincerely appreciate how the author avoids a VERY common trap that most fantasy authors fall in, which is to spend endless paragraphs describing everything down to the last detail, even the things that aren't relevant to the story itself. I can't describe how annoying it is to read a book where nothing happens for pages and pages as the author devotes a multitude of words describing things that could perfectly be left to the imagination of the reader. Kudos to Mr Paolini for telling a story straight and not losing its focus! I already ordered 'Eldest' and I'm quite looking forward to it.

The reason that I thought that it was good is because of the action sequences. Christopher Paolini's choice of words made me want to read on. I really liked the creative names he used. Since he used uncommon names it made the story more interesting. For example: Eragon, Galbatorix, and Dras Leona were among my favorites. I also liked the different settings of Eragon because it made me want to go and visit. My favorite was the Hadarac Desert because of the challenges they faced. Some challenges the characters faced were thirst, heat and it was very tiring. The recurring theme in this story is good trying to overcome evil.

Can't we all have kids like this? Please!! I just loved this \\"story behind the story\\" so much I had to read the book right away.Unfortunately, I found it didn't quite measure up. I was quite intrigued and impressed by the first 50, 60 pages or so; the characters and relationships - particularly with the dragon - were quite well done. That said, once the plot of the story kicked in, I found the book was, unfortunately, a copy or \\"borrowed heavily from\\" Star Wars and Tolkien. I certainly can't fault such a young author for this but it made the story hard for me to enjoy from that point forward; I just need more originality. My kids did not pick up on these comparissons but interestinly enough, they also found the book look its momentum at nearly the same point; in other words, it just got quite slow for them.As a result, I won't be rushing out to buy more of this young author's work any time soon. That said, I will be watching him with great expectations. He is clearly extremely talented and rapidly maturing and I anxious await for him to find his literary voice."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought the book a while back because there was so much popularity surrounding it (and I'd heard that a film was being made, and I always like to read books before I see their respective films), and just got around to starting it recently. It was very slow going in the beginning, and quite boring, actually, until I got to about page 300. Eragon got knocked out three times, I believe, in the span of fifty pages, and while conflict of that sort is necessary, it isn't quite necessary in such quantities.It got better at toward the middle and the end with the introduction of new characters and the focus taken off of the cliche \\"mysterious\\" old man whose past was blatantly obvious even if it wasn't supposed to be, but the entire book was fairly predictable.I give the benefit of the doubt to Christopher Paolini, however, because he was just a teenager when the book was published, but it's obvious by reading it that he was just a teenager. It's a typical story of some kid who's into fantasy stories writing his own about dragons in his room, and I think he needed quite a few tips on how to be subtle so as not to give away his bigger plot points when he hadn't meant to.Overall, I don't guess it was a horrible book, because if they're horrible I don't read them all the way through, but it definitely could've been better and I would've really liked it a lot more if it had been improved somewhat during the beta reading stages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a challenging book that takes place in a world called Alagaesia.

I won't say that I'm disappointed, exactly, but it definitely doesn't live up to the publicity.Yes, a seventeen year old wrote it and while that's admirable, it most definitely reads like the work of a teenager, derivative and unoriginal. It's rehash of so many other fantasy novels out there, all the clich&eacute;s are present and accounted for: poor orphan finds magical bauble, magical doohickey forces orphan out of his/her little world and into the Big Wide Dangerous World, some ancient evil force (AEF) is reawakening, said AEF sees orphan as threat and goes after him/her, orphan discovers s/he has far bigger destiny and powers than previously expected. It's routine, and in this book, so many times it's also boring.The only thing that saved this from a one star rating is 1) me happening to like those clich&eacute;s and 2) Eragon is actually interesting the more his eyes are opened to the world around him.

I fell in love with the caractors right away.I don't know what it is, but Christopher Paolini had me reading this book all night from 7p.m. to 6a.m. just to find out how it ends. Because of that I was late for school and got a F- on my test because I all i did was write my name and then I fell asleep and I slept, from 9a.m.-12p.m., utill lunch. But I didn't care because I finished the best book ever.You may think this book was predictable, but it wasn't compared to other books. For example in The Lord of the Rings Frodo was obviously going to deystroy the ring, Aragon was going to become king, and eveyone would live happily ever after. And also, people say this book is just like the Lord of the Rings well most action fantasys are, but who cares as long as it's a good book. Superb work Christopher Paolini! I give you an A+! Keep it up!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Enough with the Lord of the Rings comparisons...we realize that already. Eragon might be similar to Aragorn, but Paolini did easily explain that off as being Dragon except with E on the front. I can take that. And some of the similarities may be there if I look hard enough, but many of us are willing to turn a blind eye on that part. Let him copy--it's his first book after all...The problem with this, however, is the fact that most of it tells, rather than shows. Most of Eragorn's 'story' revolves around the past, of which people seem to like telling to him while he sat and asked questions, while his actual 'adventure' involves him going from one place to another and sometimes getting into things which he ultimately gets himself out of by being the best magician/swordfighter/something, nothing more. Brom seemed to have spoilt Eragon a bit too much. To make matters worse, all this 'telling' makes the story seem bland and mediocre at its best. Murtagh's past, for instance, was told to Eragorn in another one of these storytelling events. Where's the suspense?Then there's Saphira. Anyone else have problems with her being this perfect, pristine creature that just popped out of nowhere? She's a BABY, for Chrissakes, and yet she talks like she's been around for hundreds of years. Paolini spoilt the best part of his novel by rushing through Saphira's growth and making her an adult when she should be younger than Eragon and learning more about the world than he does. I don't buy that, \\"Dragons are wise and that's the end of it,\\" crap. I could have cared for Saphira that way, I really would have. Rather, she becomes like this talking, perfect Lassie.The writer was fifteen when he STARTED this. Started, I would like to point out. He could have very well polished this up in the past few years before he published it. Plots can be rehashed over and over and we wouldn't tire of them (admit it, we won't) IF the writer knows how to handle his works well. Unfortunately, Eragon tried to fly, but only fell flat against the cliff. It's still an okay read, but I've read fan fiction better than this. This isn't worth publishing. Good for a first-time novel, but first-time novels should be a writer's stepping stone, not his ticket to fame..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Mix together equal parts \\"Star Wars\\" and J.R.R. Tolkien, then add a generous helping of Anne McCaffrey's dragon-riders and a few random shreds of Garth Nix for good measure.Obviously originality is not Christopher Paolini's strong suit, and it shows in his fantasy debut \\"Eragon,\\" which was penned in his tender teenage years. It swims in fantasy cliches and stilted dialogue, but there's a certain awkward charm in Paolini's fantasy world. The biggest problem is, simply put, Paolini's cardboard cutout of a self-insert hero, Eragon.The titular character is lucky enough to stumble across a strange blue stone while hunting on the Spine. After failing to sell it, Eragon finds that it's actually a dragon egg, and the baby blue dragon inside selects him to hatch for and remain with forever. All the Dragon Riders were killed off by Evil King Galbatorix long ago, except for the weird old recluse Brom, who becomes Eragon's mentor.And Luke, I am your father... wait, wrong story.When Galbatorix's men destroy Eragon's home and family, Brom and Eragon flee to find the mysterious rebels known as the Varden. But Eragon's dreams are being haunted by the beautiful elf Arya, and the little band sets out to save her. Eragon and his dragon Saphira learn many things -- and make new allies -- the journey to the Varden brings them a terrible (and totally predictable) loss, and leads them to Eragon's first battle.Lofty elves, humble farm boys, ghastly goblinesque creatures, mystical women, special swords, evil tyrants who are evil because they just are, evil minions, wise mentors, and telepathic dragons in a variety of colors. Christopher Paolini never met a fantasy cliche that he didn't like. And as a result, \\"Eragon\\" is dripping with Tolkien and Lucas-style trappings, right down to the hero's suspiciously Tolkienian name.Paolini paints these typical sword-and-sorcery stories with rather stilted but promising prose. \\"Eragon\\" has some raw rookie potential, and you can detect Paolini's enthusiasm as he explores his invented fantasy land, much the way many other teenagers have done after reading high fantasy and yearning to explore their own made-up worlds. There's just not much that is new or unique about this story, although Paolini throws in some attempted humorous quirks like a weird fortune-teller.The biggest problem with Paolini's writing is that Eragon is portrayed as a noble, brave, compassionate soul with a brilliant destiny ahead of him. Well, frankly he shows no nobility, bravery or compassion, and the many characters who gasp in admiration of him does not make him any more impressive. He's a glaring self-insert, with all the dimension of a cardboard standee, and about as sendearing.The supporting characters are not much better -- Brom is too brief a character to make much of an impact, and he seems to exist mainly to get Our Hero up to snuff in information and ability. And the love interest Arya is glorified only for her otherworldly beauty... which is all she has. Eragon's adoration of her seems unfounded, because er personality is chilly at best, snotty and autocratic at worst.Christopher Paolini's \\"Eragon\\" is pretty much what you'd expect of a teenage boy's fantasy novel -- plenty of Lucas and Tolkien echoes, and a style that hasn't yet gained a sense of humor about itself."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't want to hear any more people defending Paolini because of his age. I don't want to hear anyone say \\"Could YOU write a book at age 15?\\". Any fifteen year old who read any work of fantasy could write something on par with this worse-than-mediocre book. What bothers me is that the Eragon fans' gushing praise is not towards the book but towards Paolini's ability to publish the book. If he had put this on fictionpress.com or some other amateur writers site, I would have praised it. But a published work of fiction should be good without taking an author's age into account."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wierd.

Some people might say \\"He was only 15 when he wrote it, give him a break!\\" I think that if you want to publish a book, no matter what age you are, you should at least make sure the book is good before you start bragging about it. On a side note: His parents own a publishing company!! You don't have to be a good author to publish a book if your parents OWN THE COMPANY!!!Also, there are almost NO important girl characters in the whole book! All the girls just sit around and wait to be saved!While I do understand that it takes a long time to write a book,the author \\"graduated\\" from home school, so he had PLENTY of time to write a book.I know a lot of 12-year-olds that would write and publish a novel if they could, but they don't have parents that own a publishing company or that let them graduate 3 years before everyone else does."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"They say that I should like this book. I love J.K Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien - the perfect gift you'd expect. However, as I read the first chapters, I found myself being needled with the feeling that I had read something similiar before, and it was better then. As I read more, I became bored with the whole thing. The whole thing was so predictable and unoriginal. I thought it sounded like a English class fantasy assignment gone crazy. I have read books that definitely took ideas from other \\"original\\" fantasy authors and managed to like them a little. But in Eragon, it was so OBVIOUS. Overall, I thought it was something you'd praise on the fanfiction level, but it shouldn't of been published. Glad I borrowed it instead of buying it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Star Wars with no technology and Tolkien with no wisdom. What could be better? Add some of McCaffrey's dragonriders and David Eddings special marks. . .if Paolini is 'new guard' and those original writers are 'old guard', why does the 'new guard' have to use the plots and ideas of the 'old guard'? Seems like the new guard would belong to the ones with the original ideas, past, present, and future.Fantasy readers are, by and large, pretty intelligent. We can put up with a lot of crossover from the authors we read, so long as there is an original twist. We can't be told that a book like Eragon is original and new, because we know better. Even the names are Tolkien's with some letters rearranged. Or should I say Tolkein."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"So I first saw the movie and I was very confused and decided that I should read the book. So I delved into the Inheritance series. I'm not sure why it is called the Inheritance series though since there doesn't seem to be anything inherited.Now all of the excitement is that this book was written by a 15 year old. Well it defintely shows. But while reading it I didn't feel as if this was something new. In fact there was quite a bit of borderline plagiarism going on. I saw rip offs of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dragon Riders of Pern, and numerous others. But seeing as how this was written by a kid I continued on. But the more I read the less I was impressed. There are sections that are directly from Star Wars and the only thing that changed were the names. Eragon and Saphira have no real personality and their characters don't ever develop. It's almost as if the author couldn't be bothered with creating real characters, he just gave them names and popped them into a storyline from someone else's story.There are giant plot holes such as vegetarian elves that treasure life but yet they wear leather outfits and kill people with a vengeance. The dialogue is very poorly written and the entire story has problems with flow and continuity. Of course it's fantasy but even fantasy has to have rules in order to make it believable. The author also doesn't like to show us his story, he prefers to tell us with long drawn out descriptions that interupt the action and make this book choppy and hard to keep reading. The word usage was poorly done, almost as if the author sat with a thesaurus and tried to come up with words to confound the readers. Some of the vocabulary was improperly used and made passages quite unintelligible. I have a very good vocabulary but I found that some of the words used were simply contrived and forced, rather than what the author really had in mind to begin with.The characters are all hollow and even the main antagonist is this mystical being that we never really see. We hear all about him and what he has done but he never appears to establish who he is and why we should hate him. It's almost as if we are going off of hearsay that the other characters have made up. Where is the malevolence and darkness of Galbatorix? Give us a reason to hate him!I had great difficulty staying captivated by this book. I feel that the editor of this novel did not service his client at all and that perhaps with time Chistopher Paolini may improve but only if he finds his voice and his own worlds to write about and leaves others' works alone."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Before I begin, something needs to be noted: Christopher Paolini was not 15 when he wrote Eragon and its entirety - it was a 4 year project that took him until he was 19.Simple, right?So, because he's young, it's gotta be good too, right?No. Not really.While Paolini's grammar is solid, the characters fail to leap up and grab the attention of the reader. His description is decent, however nothing about it is particularly noteworthy. I would expect such a thing out of a young writer.I feel Paolini's greatest weakness here is his obvious use of high-fantasy cliches that plague nearly all paperback fantasy today, and dialogue that is flat as well as incorrect.He obviously sticks to the Hero's Journey, but he makes no attempt to make the journey emotionally deep, much less entertaining.Secondly, you have trademark character templates that were established by better writers. The orphaned, 'chosen' hero, his trusty steed, his wise mentor/father figure, his mysterious raven-haired love interest, and an evil king (who should technically be called an Emperor, because he's the ruler of an EMPIRE).His dialogue is probably what bothered me most in this book. All of the characters sound alike - all say 'aye' like the word 'yes' never existed (and by the medieval era it did - yes has been in use since the 900's). No character sounds educated, there is no difference in class through dialogue.There are also techincal descpreptancies such as Eragon's sword being roughly 5 ft in the first printing, and Eragon's rage over the ideal of slavery, as well as his plans to free a group of slaves that is forgotten nearly a chapter later as if the event never took place.Despite this, younger readers who new to the genre will find this entertaining, and a step into the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book Eragon was written by the American author Christopher Paolini. Christopher Paolini began writing the book when he was just 15 years old and he published it on 22 April 2004 in the United States.The book tells the story of the 15-years-old Eragon, who lives with his uncle and his cousin in the small village Carvahall. Someday he finds a mysterious, blue stone in the mountains. Eragon attempts to sell it and therefore he takes the stone to a trader specializing in jewels. But the trader says to him, that he has never seen anything like this before. Soon afterward Eragon realizes that the stone is actually a dragon egg and as it hatches into a dragon he names Saphira. After a few days two mysterious strangers enter the town looking for the dragon. Saphira leaves the town with Eragon and while Eragon is away the mysterious strangers kill his uncle and put his yard on fire. On his return Eragon meets Brom the village storyteller, who wants to flee Carvahall with Eragon and Saphira. At the evening Brom explains to Eragon the situation, in the process he says that Eragon is the last Dragon Rider. A long time ago the Dragon Riders were peacekeepers with magic skills, but then the evil king Galbatorix has killed them and now this evil king wants to kill Eragon. On their journey Brom helps Eragon to discover his magical abilities, but they are lured into a trap of the evil forces. Brom dies and before his death he reveals that he was once a Dragon Rider and that his dragon was murdered by Galbatorix. Brom advices Eragon to find the ,,Varden\\" (These are rebels who are fighting against Galbatorix). When Eragon finds the secret hiding of the Varden, Galbatorix sends an army to this place. A battle that everything decides is coming...I really enjoyed reading the book, because the story is very exciting and the characters are well presented. Furthermore Christopher Paolini describes the imaginative world very precisely so that the reader can easily imagine the landscapes, the persons and the buildings. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, because I think that this book is one of the best I have ever read, once you pick this book up you will not be able to put it down until you finish it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have read three books from the series, and Im reading the last one.

Eragon is just a decent book, but the overall plot and characters caught my interest enough for me to want to read the sequels, which are better.First of all, one must keep in mind Paolini was only 17 when he wrote this. It's impressive that he had the writing skills to craft a plot, develop a decent style, and most of all, possess the fortitude to finish a novel. I give my rating of three stars in consideration of his age. If this was written by a 30 year old, I'd give one star.Paolini shows some of the strengths he'd develop more in Eldest. First of all, Eragon is a fairly developed protagonist. He acts his age. Many teenage heroes tend to be overly mature and super skilled. Eragon has a sex drive, is victim to infatuation, doesn't have much foresight, and makes several mistakes. The supporting characters are also intriguing and fairly developed. Saphira is a good example of a non-humanoid, feminine character.The plot has a decent pace. There's a good balance of action, character develop, and suspense. The ending is satisfying and complete but leaves room for more. His development of the \\"ancient language\\" is sophisticated for his age. The villains are cool enough for fantasy. He develops a complicated, logic-based system for using magic.With that being said, there are many sub-par elements. Primarily, the concept is extremely unoriginal. Paolini uses the primary fantasy races in all the cliche manners. Humans are jacks-of-all trades, masters of none. Elves are ancient, in tune with nature, immortal, and superior in almost every way to humans. Dwarves live underground and like to mine, drink, and fight. Everybody hates the barbaric Urgals (basically Orcs.) Paolini bases his ancient language (which is spoken by the elves) strongly on Tolkien's elvish languages. Eragon has nothing new to add to fantasy culture.The overall plot is far too similar to Star Wars. There's an evil king who wiped out most of the protectors of peace (the Dragon Riders) and now tyrannically rules an empire. A random villager suddenly finds himself bonded to a dragon hatchling, and now he is destined to become the dragon rider that will over-throw the emperor. He and the dragon get trained by an old mentor-figure who keeps way too many secrets. The three of them embark on a quest to join up with the fledgling rebellion.Then there's his style, which has much room for improvement. Many descriptions are difficult to understand. He makes a common young writer mistake of trying to sound more sophisticated than what he is. Finally (and for me, this was the worst), he has some really corny dialogue, especially attempts at humor. I actually felt so awkward I had to pause in my reading to recover.So my list of cons is longer than my pros. However, considering Paolini's age, and the fact that I enjoyed reading the book, I give it three stars. Eragon ends with much room for improvement in the sequel, and his plot was engaging enough for me to immediately delve into Eldest to continue the saga."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book was excellent quality and it arrived quickly. No problems with this order. It was a library style bound book rather than the hardcover for the sets that I've purchased when released so I was unclear about that when I purchased it but it's a great book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book arrived on time but it was a little more beat up than I anticipated.

I should not have bothered. The story was no better! I ended up rushing through to get the thing finished.The writer of this book was young, and his achievemnt should not be underestimated, and indeed has now been well rewarded. But as a work of fiction, this is just not one I could recommend. I expect readers who have read very little fantasy fiction (especially young readers) will enjoy this work. But those who have read widely will find it derivative. There are better versions of the same tale.Edit: And true to my prediction, a 9 year old friend of my daughter loves this work. His mother cringes and cannot bring herself to read it to him, so he is on his own with this one.

I give praise to Paolini being able to write such as complex book at 15."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Reading this book was like trudging through a swamp. I bought it because it had so many great reviews, and was practically being heralded as the best book of the age. That was what made me finish it. I wanted to read it through, and see for myself just what the fuss was all about. It was severely disappointing. Other books, receiving less acclaim, like \\"Brige to Terebithia\\" and \\"Number the Stars\\" (labeled as \\"children's books,\\" yet dealing with adult issues) rang more true, and had more alive characters, than this giant volume. The author copied blatantly from Tolkien, in the elves' silver ships, the name \\"Urgals,\\" in the map of the land itself. But that is just the beginning. I agree with whoever gave this book one star that Paolini tells everything rather than shows. So much of the book was predictable. The death of Eragon's uncle, the fact that Brom would be Eragon's mentor and come along, and Brom's death. Everything, from the sword which has a name to Eragon's mysterious parents, to his rescue and friendship with a beautiful-yet-brave female, has been done before. The book lacks the necessary spins and quirks that would make these elements interesting. Someone once said that there are only two or three different stories in the world, and I agree. Eragon belongs to the \\"quest/coming of age\\" genre, like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Everyone knows Rowling borrowed off Tolkien, yet their stories are vastly different. Tolkien captivates his readers with the depth and development of Middle Earth, as well as his language which rolls off your tongue like poetry. Rowling keeps us on the edge of our seats with characters you can understand in a snap, quirky humor, and unbelievably complex, puzzle-like plots. Paolini has neither. His story is linear, and Eragon grows in predictable steps. Not to mention Saphira, who is absolutely perfect and too wise for her to be believable. She undergoes zero character growth. Paolini also needs to develop his own voice. The descriptions are bordering on poetic, but they sound forced, as if he's imitating older voices and styles but failing. The dialogue also needs improvement. In some places, like when Eragon sees the dead villagers and says shakily, \\"Who could have done...\\" and Brom responds, \\"...there is only one name for them: evil,\\" I grimaced at the corniness. It was too fake, too composed. The few things I liked were the giant shattered gem at the end (a plot point I'd not predicted, despite the vast amount of time spent on describing the gem), and Eragon's first ride with Saphira. The pain he suffered from her scales was a practical consideration other authors hadn't thought of before. The only other twist I enjoyed was the fact that Eragon's sword is infamous, not famous. Other than that, this book was not worth reading, except once. Paolini has good ideas, but he needs time to let them grow, time to make them into his own, and, most of all, time to develop his own voice and tricks that will make his book seem new, and not like a giant mixing pot of all the fantasy books that have ever been published, smashed into one volume. I sincerely hope that his next book will be a vast improvement, complete with new, 3-dimensional characters."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I know that this story was written by a teenager. Does that make it more enjoyable to read? No.Frankly, Eragon is extremely unoriginal. I'm NOT talking about how it's similar to LoTR, because LoTR didn't invent elves and dwarves (though he was one of the first to make an entirely new world, but EVERY fantasy novel has that) and Eragon doesn't mean Aragorn, it means Dragon with a letter changed. It's unoriginal because it's like EVERY fantasy novel: orphan goes on quest with magical creatures in a new land. There is nothing surprising or new in this novel. I would also like to point out that the way magic is used in this book is COMPLETELY stolen from Ursula K. Leguin's Earthsea series, but nobody points that out because LoTR is more popular. -_-Writing? It was OK. The fact it's great for a teenager doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Characterization? Ick. Eragon is too powerful, often a characer will state,\\"Wow, you managed to do that in X days when it takes most people X months.\\" Most people are pretty flat.OK, now for the good things. Some people like novels that are unoriginal, that's what they like to read and they call it,\\"Archtypal fantasy.\\" Not me, but a lot of other people. It gets more exciting and original as it goes along. I'm interested enough to read the sequal, but don't waste your money, just check it out from the library."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"All in all, Eragon is a good story that held my attention from beginning to end. There are good points to this story as well as bad and I will do my best to explain both without giving the story away.First the good. I felt that the dialogue between the characters was well written. Better than most I've read recently and that is saying a lot. What I am finding more and more, with both new and well-established writers alike, is the inability to correctly match their characters words and emotions with the situation. Characters seem to get angry over nothing and the anger is never explained. This wasn't a problem for Paolini. If his characters get angry, you know why.Another aspect of the story that I really enjoyed is Paolini's cities and towns. They were well described without, in my opinion anyway, being over-described and they seemed diverse enough for me to discover something new with each new city.There are also the fight scenes, which were exciting and credible, that is, if magic really existed. I found myself reading those passages too quickly in my excitement and would have to go back and read them again to really absorb the writing.I also really enjoyed the relationship between Eragon and the dragon. It was touching, which was quite unexpected with all the testosterone running around. It was a nice surprise.He imparts wisdom. It may not be as memorable as Gandalf telling Frodo to \\"not be too quick to deal out death and judgement for even the wise cannot see all ends\\", but wisdom it is and he gave me pause in more than a few places. Bravo for that. It just goes to show that we, the elders, don't know it all.Now for the bad. There are far too many similarities between Eragon and LOTR. I found myself giving heavy sighs whenever I stumbled across an LOTR read-alike and there were a lot of them.Another problem I had was with some of the terms he used, such as War axe instead of just using Axe or Double-bladed axe. I felt, at those times only, that I was reading a poorly written comic book authored by a group of pimply faced Dungeons and Dragons/War Hammer addicts.There is also a problem with the path his characters take across the countryside. They seem to traverse the land back and forth a few times, almost as if the land itself was actually quite small and he ran out of room for the \`Quest', if indeed there really is a quest. Perhaps a quest was never Paolini's intention, but with the many similarities to LOTR, a quest is what I saw attempted.Now, neither bad nor good, this story is on the simple side. It is as easy to read as Harry Potter and will appeal most to younger people, but as is the case with Harry Potter, I believe that many adults would enjoy it as well. If you are an LOTR purist, this story might not be for you. However, I consider myself an LOTR purist and I enjoyed this story. I can't say that I love the story and it never made me cry and come to think of it, I don't think I laughed once, but still, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is one of the worst books ever written, and I will explain why:1. It's the most predictable book I have ever read. I could tell what was going to happen from reading the inside flap, cover, and prologue: a kid was going to find a dragon egg and ride the hatched dragon to a victory over something called a Shade (which is disappointing too: Paolini, who was clearly about 15 when he wrote this book, could have come up with a more creative name).2. Eragon seems unreal. You can't tell anything that's in his head at that time unless he's \\"saying\\" it to the dragon. The author may be descriptive about the world around Eragon, but I couldn't even put a picture of him in my head!3. It copies about every other fantasy book I have ever read in my entire life. Even the name of the main character is drawn from LOTR (just like the plot). The idea of \\"learning\\" magic is from Harry Potter, and all those non-evil dragons is from every other awful fantasy book. I was disgusted with this.I got this book as a Christmas present and it amazes me that I haven't sold it yet.

I realize at this early stage in your life this book may amaze you. Nothing wrong with that. I aks only that you come back to this book in a few years after you have (hopefully) explored some of the real works of fantasy literature. I won't even compare this book to LOTR--that's like comparing apples to oranges (one written by a brilliant linguist for adults--no--I'm not talking about the Hobbit--the other written by an ambitious kid with more family connections than talent). Hold this up to Lloyd alexander's Prydian books, or Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series for example--after all this is at heart a kids book. I think in a few years you 5 star reviewers may feel a bit embaressed by all of your gushing praise for what is really just a sub-par rip off of a wide variety of books. Sure--everyone is influenced by boosk the've reasd in the past. There is a big difference however between being influenced and blatanlty ripping off whole story lines and plot devices verbatim (and no Christopher--it doesn't make it \\"OK\\" that you simply cahnged the names a bit).

Eragon was written by a teenager and it is terribly obvious. I found it to be melodramatic, stereotypical, heavy handed, unpolished, and worst of all, boring and utterly predictable at every turn. The writing style the author uses strikes me as particularly immature and undeveloped. Every description is something like, \\"The shining moon cast a silvery glowing lightness over the darkened forest's misty landscape.\\" Please kill me now. Paolini should be locked up by the grammar police for adjective abuse. Also problematic are the stereotypical characterizations of both the good guys and the bad guys, the overused \\"reluctant young hero on a quest\\" plotline, and the created languages the author has constructed simply by plugging made-up words into English grammatical structure.This might be a decent read for the under 10 set, but if you've ever read a single fantasy novel before or happen to be a fan of GOOD writing, then Eragon has nothing to offer you.

It really shouldn't be this long. 400 pages, honestly. But it ends up going a whole extra 100 when it didn't have to. Editing is your friend.The story is the story. A kid finds a dragon egg and it automatically makes him the newest member of a long dead society of \\"Dragon Riders\\" when it hatches. The bad guys know all about the egg and want to hire on whoever ends up finding it. And so do the good guys. So said kid, Eragon (Dragon, with \\"D\\" replaced with an \\"E.\\" &lt;---how droll) ends up part-time running for his life, part-time learning how to use the powers of becoming a Rider.The similarities to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are ASTOUNDING!!!Eragon needs the help of a helpful old wizard-man with a mysterious past.So did Luke Skywalker.Eragon's powers are very much Jedi.Eragon travels over vast distances with the wizard-man who ends up dying. Just like Gandalf and Ben Kenobi.Eragon meets up with and travels with different new collegues. Just like Luke and Frodo did.Nobody has the lockdown on elves and dwarves, so it's okay to see them in this book. Whatever.But I was alarmed at seeing the evil brutes, i.e. Urgals so like the Orcs. And by the way, since the Orcs could become the Huru Kai, why not make the orcs be able to transform into the Kull? Might as well steal everything, right?And while the writer is at it, he goes on to make the Urgals minions of the great leader Shade. Much like how Saruman controlled the Orcs.Shade = Saruman as Galbatorix = Sauron.Things like these go on and on and on. It was almost like the writer asked himself, \\"how can I rewrite these stories and jam them together into one overlong book?\\" It's maddening to see how outright he does this stuff. The real reason why I cannot completely bash this book is that he does it so damn well. He illustrates what's going on in a very vivid and imaginative manner. Eragon is a likeable guy. He just wants to live his life as a young man growing up poor in a small town. He didn't ask for the egg, but there it is...right in his lap and he has to follow his destiny or die because the bad guys will kill him.I liked Saphira the dragon quite a bit and her slowly growing, possessive love for Eragon is actually pretty cute. She is wise and gentle, but I found it weird how she was BORN with memories and knowledge. Guess I just don't understand dragons.It drags from time to time because it's too long. But it didn't kill me. Sometimes I was indifferent, but never actually bored. Yet, one thing the writer does well is create a scenario and just before you ask yourself \\"well, why don't you do this instead?\\" somebody explains why doing \\"this\\" is a dumb idea. He does this so often, I kind of giggled at it.I liked the book. I just wish somebody else hadn't written it first. I really hope the next piece isn't a rehash of other people's ideas. I really do."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was a dissapointing book. It was a rip-off of the lord of the rings--even the note at the end is like lord of the rings (\\"may your swords stay sharp\\") the language Paolini made up is unoriginal and is just like what the elves speak in the Hobbit. Every time Eragon got into a conflict, he went unconscious and appeared somewhere safe when he woke up. He goes unconscious in almost every chapter and there is only one main plot line--no mini twists or turns--altogether it was pretty predictable. And even the main character's name, Eragon, sounds just like Araghorn from LOTR."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book before I knew it was written by a 15 year old. The story is a sorry hodge- podge of the favourite fantasy authors, but without the in- depth character creation or story , that one would expect. I'm sorry to say that mid-way I had started skipping pages ,to get through faster. Anyway it was not all bad, the beginning at least had promise, even if it didn't follow through.

It's a quick, entertaining read. There are some BAD fantasy books out there, this is not one of them.However, if you expect to pick this book up and find refined, imaginative prose or orginal twists on ancient themes- you will not find them here. With details too close to Tolkein, McCaffery, LeGuinn, Pullman, and others to ignore, Paolini's own voice and vision is rarely, if ever, heard. In places bordering on outright plagiarism. Fanfiction has it's place, but sold as serious literature? In fact, as I handed over Eragon to a friend to read this morning I described it as Tolkein \\"lite\\" which she seemed pleased at the thought of. So, perhaps it has it's place with those who like the idea of Tolkein but do not yet have the ability to read through his whole works (younger readers) or those who do wish to invest the energy to consume such a work.My other issue with this book was his painful descriptions of his crush on Arya. Luckily this comprised only very little of the book. These stirring emotions, however were clearly written by one with no first hand knowledge. There were other areas too, sorely in need of a competant editor.There are redeeming qualities, not the lesat of which is that anything that results in kids as enthusiastic readers gets an A+ in my book. Hopefully they will move on to more masterfully written pieces as their tastes mature. I look forward to Paolini maturing as an author."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon by Christopher Paolini is set in the mystical land of Alagasia, with the main character, Eragon. Eragon sets out hunting when he finds a blue stone. He doesn't know what it is, but thinks that it will at least buy him some food. Eragon finds the stone is a dragon's egg when it hatches. He names the dragon Saphira, and through a turmoil of events, Eragon sets out looking for the ever elusive Ra'zac (who killed his Uncle Garrow) with the town storyteller, Brom. Brom seems to know much of dragons, and has been around since the days of the old Dragon Riders. Brom trains Eragon in swordsmanship, shows him the tricks of magic, and shows Eragon how to read. Will Eragon defeat the evil henchmen of the evil king of Alagasia, Galbatorix? Read Eragon to find out!Eragon, in my opinion, is a wonderful fantasy book for all kinds of readers. This book can be slow at times, and I thought that parts of it could have been cut out completely, and summed up in a few sentences. For example, while Brom and Eragon are traveling, they talk about things that weren't necessary to the plot.The book seems very similar to the plots of the original Star Wars movies. It would be possible to see Luke Skywalker fitting in Eragon's place. Many of the words of places and names seem to be vaguely familiar to those of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, if it is possible to overlook these things, Eragon is very enjoyable.I would recommend Eragon to any fan of fantasy, dragon stories, or even someone who likes just about everything."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After reading Eragon, I felt that I had read a very interesting book yet I felt like the author had tried to make the book as long as he could. Eragon by Christopher Paolini has one of the most intriguing plots I have ever seen, dealing with dragons, magic, and an evil king. The book was told in first person from the point of view of Eragon, a young-adult who discovered a dragon egg while hunting for deer. Along his journey, Eragon meets new people and discovers his powers as a dragon rider.I thought this was a very good book told from a good perspective. The only thing that seemed \\"overdone\\" was the amount of fantasy in the book and the length. It was very detailed and seemed like the author had come up with a whole new language just for the book. I did enjoy this book even though it was lengthy and took me a while to read. I recommend this book to young-adults ages 12-18."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In Eragon, I feel that there is more good in it than bad. The things I do like in the book are it is mostly descriptive, dramatic, exciting, emotional, well thought out, and intresting enough to keep reading. It also had a unique medival magic touch that applied to both the action and the plot.The action sequences were planned well and thrilling. The language, characters, time, and location were mythtical yet strangly realistic. They were very different from other fantasy novels.The things I did not like in the book were the boring and hard to be intrested in parts. The magic and fantasy were sometimes confusing. Mind talk, lack of supporting details, and the huge amount of creatures, some of which were mentioned only once, are on my bad list.All in all, there is more good than bad in my opinion, and Eragon is an enjoyable book for everyone."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I can't wait to buy the next one! I recommend this book if you are going on a long road trip. The reason is because it is long and will keep you occupied and ready for anything. The protagonist is amazing. He is brave to extreme measures! I liked this book because it is three of my favorite genres. Action: He rode a dragon and he fought many battles with many different creatures. Fantasy: There were elves and dragons and many other fantastical creatures. Romance: Eragon falls in love with Arya but I dont think she knows. This book is amazing and it has a sequel which makes it doubly amazing!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Here's an exciting fantasy that you can escape into.Eragon, a fifteen year-old farm boy who lived in a small village named Carvahall in the land of Aligasia, finds a strange blue stone in a mountain where few men dare to trot. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, the blue stone hatches into a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon quickly bonds with his dragon, Saphira, and when his uncle is killed by the Ra'zac, he decides to seek revenge. Soon thereafter, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a part in the wars between humans, Varden, dwarves, elves, Shades and their Neanderthal Urgalls, and the evil King Galbatorix.Throughout the adventure, Eragon, still a young boy (even though the dragon grew into an adult within only a few days), grows in magic power and learns the art of wielding it. Together with his dragon Saphira they endure perilous travels, battles, injuries, capture and escape. He also falls in love with the elf Arya. A non-stop action packed story!What I found interesting in the book is that there are many magic words and phrases in the Ancient Language. Did Paolini create this language or was it borrowed from real magic texts (or from other novels)? The language seemed convincing, as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls (in their own native tongue).After I finished reading the book, I found out that Christopher Paolini began Eragon when he was just 15. It took him three years to complete the book. Quite an impressive feat!But there were a few weaknesses in the book. I was looking forward to a richer relationship between Eragon and the elf Arya. This never materialized. Eragon first saw Arya in his thoughts, chained and being tortured. He set out to rescue her, succeeded, but found her unconscious from the wounds she suffered at the hand of the torturers. She remained unconscious throughout most of the book until the very end, when the war against the army of Galbatorix was imminent! Eragon's love towards Arya was only a crush for a relationship between them never developed.I also found that Paolini missed many opportunities to build suspense. The trek across the desert to seek healers for the elf Arya, for example, was not as exciting as I had hoped for. I wanted to see Eragon struggle a bit more. I wanted more suspense and surprises; a reason to eagerly keep turning the pages!Another major weakness was that Paolini was telling instead of showing. His characters were telling us the story instead of showing us! It would have been more exciting to have Eragon find out the \\"truths\\" instead of them being told to him (and us!). For example, the long narrative of the witch telling Eragon about events instead of Eragon finding them out on his own.Another weakness other readers found was Paolini's use of grammar and punctuation. I am not an expert in this field, so I was not bothered at all by this. But going through the other reviews on amazon.com, many adult readers were bothered by this. One reader noted, \`While there are devastating mistakes any author can make, there is usually a kind of \\"cushion\\" awaiting him in the form of a cunning editor.' One reviewer stated, \\"But where was the editor? Surely, there must have been an editor who could have coached Paolini through some of the more obvious flaws in the book.\\" Another stated, \\"In summary, the author should be congratulated for his industry. The publisher should be sued. The editor should be fired.\\"As many readers pointed out, the book shows the influence of J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the Rings), Terry Brooks (Shannara Epic, Landover Series, Word Void Trilogy) Anne McCaffrey (Dragonriders of Pern, A Gift of Dragons), and even Karl Edward Wagner (his creation of a blood and thunder immortal named Kane, an anti-hero in a field that came to be known as \\"dark fantasy\\") and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, and dragons. It also shows the influence of Leguin (the idea of one true name and one true language forming the backbone of magic), some Dragonlance, and some George Lucas' Star Wars, which took over his book. Some experienced readers in the field of fantasy might find this annoying and bordering on plagiarism. Such readers will not find this book enjoyable, especially if they have read authors such as Robert Jordan (The Wheel of Time), C.S. Lewis (The Chronicles of Narnia), Phillip Pullman (The Golden Compass), Rawling (Harry Potter), and Stephen R. Donaldson (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant), to name only a few. First time readers into this genre, however, will be captivated by the world Paolini creates.Book II of the Inheritance Trilogy, the Eldest, is now out, and Book III (which will be entitled Empire) of this saga should be out sometime this year."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"reading books like these makes you appreciate George R. Martin, Tad Williams, J.R Tolkein, and even Robert Jordan. Paolini began work on this at 15, and that could not be more apparent. the poor quality of the writing immediately jumped out at me. sometimes the writing was just so bad i had to put the book down. to be fair, he was young when he started his writing career, but it is kind of funny to imagine Paolini sitting there trying to find an adjective he hasnt used yet. for example im making this up but it would be something like quiet said murtagh icily, followed by okay said aragon angrily. some bits of writing are just classic,for example \\"im sorry\\" apologized Murtagh. is it me or is that redundant, he said he is sorry,why is there a need to write he apologized? the writing itself was enough to anger me.now on to the story itself. this story is like a stereotype wrapped in an archetype wrapped in a clich&eacute;. just bland writing and boring material,thats all there is to this book. The plot,characters, everything is just so predictable. reading this book you can just imagine what the movie trialer would be like: one boy, one dragon, and one unforgettable adventure. coming this summer.(insert montage here). i mean it, every old idea, every cliche, its all here. im 16 and if you locked me in a room for 24 hours i could write a far better book than this pieve of garbage disguised as literature. Paolini tries to pass it off as \\"an archetype\\" of the classic adventure genre. i think hes either too lazy or not a good enough writer to come up with his own material.to summarize:put every fantasy novel you know into a blender add a few drops of poor writing, liquefy for half a minute and out comes Eragon.

Even after several hundred pages however I found the book only decreased my attention span, making me reach for Tolkien if only to read something with a little depth in between the boring chapters of this one. What a bore. The plot and character development is so weak and superficial. None of it is really believable, and never did the story truly compel me to keep going. I dont know...its just hard to explain how unrealistic it all is, and corny, unless we accept that the main character Eregon is a god to whom everything comes easily. Really I kept going for my friend's sake. I do agree with many of the other critiques in that this story seems to be a compilation of ideas from other authors.I should say though that if you like books that kind of just get to the point without lots of background and plot development you may like this one (my friend who enjoyed Eregon so much was bored with Tolkien). I bet younger readers would enjoy this as well. If you like more depth in a book however I would pick up Eregon as a last resort.

I bought it as a trial.It took me nearly a year to read it. I would see it on the shelf, but I wouldn't pick it up. I didn't feel up to wading through the sludge I was sure I would encounter within. I wasn't wrong: there are many parts that are tedious, long, and above all clich&eacute;d.When I read a book, I expect to find something original. I always thought most people would be like me. So have those who give this book a place of honour on their shelves simply never read any other fantasy stories?The age of the author does not impress me...It's the book I'm concerned with, not the person who wrote it, and if somebody wants to publish a book at the age of seventeen that's their business.Three stars, because while unoriginal and uninspiring, it was still interesting enough to keep me reading.

If you want to read the best fiction story ever made, this is it. I couldn't stop reading. Every time I started I couldn't stop until I had to go to bed. This is the best book EVER!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first heard that the author started writing Eragon when he was 15, I was genuinely impressed that he had gotten it published so quickly. I immediately set out to read it was what I got was... a very big disappointement. While I do not hate this book, I find that the author could use some polishing. His *parent's* publishing company published it afterall, so I don't think that his book really deserved it.I think I know what those who treasure and worship this book will try to say to me: \\"this book is awesome? Why do you diss it?\\" or something along the likes of it. Well, here's my question for them: why do you like it? I personally don't see it as some great literary achievment. Why? I'll tell you.Firstly, I found this book way too predictable. I was about halfway through when I decided to test myself and plot out what I thought was going to happen. I more or less hit the bull's eye. I knew that Eragon would eventually end up, after a series of adventures, captured by the enemy, then he would miraculously escape, travel across some wild terrain and end up with the people opposing the Empire, who would then promptly act annoyed and frustrated with him and enjoy taunting him. I also knew that in some act of herosim, Brom would either die or mysteriously dissapear and appear dead. The last battle scene was also expected. From reading the table of contents, I figured that Arya was the girl from Eragon's dream and I also expected Eragon to come and rescue her.Secondly, I found the characters bland. Eragon seemed pathetic: he passed out, he cried... toughen up! A hero, no matter how weak he is, should always attempt to face his enemy with good faith and never submit to unconsciousness. Saphira seemed more like a cute, cuddley teddy-bear than some all-powerful being. And Brom was more or less a clone of Gandalf or even Belgarath from the Belgariad. Arya proved an interesting character, but her elveness, her dark beauty, her power, her independence reminded me all too much of either Luthien or Arwen from Tolkien's invention. There wasn't enough character development.Thirdly, I found the language and sentence structure used was poor. Some words seemed over repeated and the way the book was written made it seem like a 15 year old trying to write like Tolkien. The discriptions also tended to drag. At times, the novel felt like an info dump. The dialog, too, was bland. And Eragon's thought-speak with Sahpira began to irratate me after awhile.Fourthly, every idea seemed borrowed from Tolkien and Lucas and even Wagner. Maybe it's because most fantasy novels are based on mythology that they are similar, but this seemed to come as an attempt to sound like those creators and I doubt that he did much research. The language of the elves...? Elvish, perhaps? Magic seeming almost uncannily like... is it, the Force? Except with words? Or like the Will-and-the-Word?Fifthly, I found that the novel didn't really go anywhere. I think that the author more or less had his characters and wanted them to go somewhere. I get that image from how he writes and the way that it drags on.While I did not enjoy this book, I find that it doesn't merit 1 star. I gave it 2 stars because it obviously appeals to less experienced and/or younger readers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, is a great fantasy, one of the best I've ever read! It is exciting, tense, and it pulls you right in! The writing is great for any writer, especially one who is EIGHTEEN!Yes, as was said in other reviews, this book does have a few resemblances to The Lords of the Rings, Harry Potter, and a few other good fantasies. However, I really don't think this makes this book a cheap copy. Only a few names, characters, and places are similar to The Lord of the Rings and others. The basic plot may be familiar, but you can't really call it a \\"copy\\", because it is the classic plot for a fantasy, so if Paolini copied, then so did Tolkien and many others. Is the exact wording and letters the same? No. And in my opinion, the actual words are what matter the most, not a few names. To be honest, when I first read Eragon, I didn't even notice any similarities, because I just read it like a regular book, and let myself wrapped up in it. I didn't sit there like a critical reviewer picking out every fault and similarity in the book.Oh, and one more thing. I saw one or two reviews that said something like \\"When you kids who like Eragon grow up and read real fantasies, you'll feel pretty silly/ashamed of yourselves for liking this pathetic attempt\\". How do you know that just because someone is a kid, and if they disagree with your OPINION about Eragon, they haven't read many fantasies, and they are \\"just kids, they'll feel silly later when they realize how bad Eragon is\\". How do you know that? For your information, I'm still a kid, and I've read MANY fantasies, (I LOVE to read), and Eragon is the second best I've ever read (Harry Potter still is the best). And yes, I've read The Lord of the Rings, the one you like to talk about and refer to so much. And I have to say, Eragon is by far BETTER (in my opinion), than LOTR. Now I'm not saying that LOTR is a bad book- it's a great one. However, Eragon beats it by a mile.So in conclusion, Eragon is an excellent book. I urge you to just give it a try. I can't wait until Eldest is published!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Some say that this book is not worth reading because is has parts relating to other books (mainly LOTR), and i agree, this book dose relate to LoTR. THe whole history of the land is the same as that of Middle-Earth with the elves coming to this land from sea, the dwarves hiding in their great mountain-halls, with the who country being thretend by an evil mastermind who had betrayed everyone, and last of all the one perosn who if became who they were born to be could put and end to it all, Eragon becoming a Rider and Aragorn Becoming king of Gondor. But to me that is just one of the aspects that make this book what it is, a true clasic.So yes i belive that this book has many borrowed themes, but personaly i loved the lord of the rings series because of the way it was writen and the sceans that it created, and this is what makes a worth while book its kind of another perspective on what could have happend in that story. Now im only 15 and i know that when i read a book i will sistimaticly change things is my head of what i thought should have happend.I say that chris has got him self a classic that should be widly read and openly criticed, because with criticsm this book will become a ledgend as Lord of the Rings has.And to all of those of u who think that because it is a bad book because it has borrowed themes, chew on this - If Eragon can mimic LoTR's story play why cant it mimic its succes?Good Luck Chris."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have to say that I truly enjoyed this novel. Although many of the concepts are like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this book is refreshingly modern. Furthermore, Cristopher Paolini is concise, unlike Mr. Tolkein who had a tendancy to ramble on and on about the most random topics.The world of Alagaesia is original and the idea of the epic Dragon Riders and their legendary powers made me quiver with excitement. I absolutely loved this book, but yearned for more information about the elves. Also, Eragon and Saphira are the perfect dynmaic duo. There is an innocent, unconditional friendship between them. Arya is just the correct amount of mystery, Murtagh (despite the horrible puce-like name) is the perfect image of rugged depressed heart throb, and Brom is a great father-figure. The one thing I could not stand, in a good way, was the mystery of it all. There were no true straight answers to anything. I can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a lonely boy who has to support his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran by hunting in the Spine. It is good hunting because nobody else in his town ever goes there. One day Eragon finds a turquoise stone. Eragon thinks that he has gotten some luck at long last. To him it looks like the stone could buy him food for at least three years. But when the traders come late, Brom, the storyteller, tells the small town of Carvahall about the old government, the empire. The dragon riders ran the government with their magic. The dragons hatch when the rider that was meant for them has the egg and is ready to become a rider. Everybody was happy until Galbatorix overthrew the riders and has ruled since that terrible event. Soon Eragon's stone cracks and out pops a tiny little dragon whom Eragon names Saphira. When Saphria gets big enough she and Eragon soon go on many great adventures. Now it lies on Eragon's shoulders to relieve the world of the evil King Galbatorix.Christopher Palnoni fills the book with adventure, and makes it unpredictable. He also makes the characters so lifelike that when I was reading it I was seeing a movie in my head. It is a real page-turner. I think that it is amazing that he wrote a book when he was fifteen that is better written then most authors who have graduated college. It is the best book I have ever read and I recommend it for any age and even people who like other genres."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As a long time reader of fantasy and science fiction, I'm not sure I understand the complete disgust some of the reviewers are feeling concerning this book. For me, Eragon is a good fill in as my post-LOTR:RotK-high wanes, and I anxiously await the next installment in Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I've read Tolkien, McCaffery, Lackey, Tad Williams, and many others. The fact that many elements are obviously taken from these greater works didn't take any enjoyment away from my reading. Not an epic, I agree, but not a waste of time. For those people who have found books of a Tolkien-esque scale intimidating in their size and vocabulary, I think this is a good start to get into the genre. If you are well aquainted with fantasy novels, this is a nice Saturday afternoon read when you just want to read something for the fun of it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is pure and unadulterated trash that would never have made it to the approved pile of a real publishing house. The editor would have taken one look at the gaping plot holes, painful dialog and pseudo-intelligent word choice and sent a kindly worded \\"Thank you for your submission but ...\\" letter. It's lucky the kid had indulgent parents with bundles of money to throw away on this massive turd of a story. The author should do a complete rewrite on the story and 1- fire his original editor for not catching all of the continuity errors in the original and 2- be prepared to still be turned down by editors that have better things to do with their time than wade through his awful prose.As for the movie well ... it doesn't matter how much you polish a turd it's still a turd."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this book I reconmend to young readers of all ages who loves fantasy and dragons. The first and only thing I heard about this was \\"it was written by a 17 year old kid!\\" As I dove into this novel, not only did I find it indeed gripping, put also extremely updated, as if Eragon was a boy at modern time. All his actions and emotions bears a reality to things I do on regular days. I absorbed every word and was lost in reality, being caried away to the virtual world that young master Paolini has written; I felt like I was Eragon, riding along side Brom and upon Saphira while waving the Zarrock. I praise Paolini for this novel and i hope for more series from him."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read the paperback that was the movie tie-in. I was very impressed with the mature themes that were introduced throughout the scenes in a fast-moving book that covers more than 700 pages.The tenuous balance of trust, fear and hate; false leaders with utopian pronouncements that yield to death and destruction; imperialists bent on destroying cultures, enslaving the survivors and stealing their history to rewrite the past and a main character who must grow into the herculean role of not only being a savior to the remnants of a \\"lost\\" civilization, but bringing past truths back to life are deftly weaved through the book.Christopher Paolini may have started writing Eragon at the age of 15, but his maturity in writing the novel is reflected through the mirror that clearly displays the world in which we live in."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"A friend of mine had been recommending that I read this book for about a year before I broke down and read it. I read through the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Chronicles of Narnia series and came away unimpressed.This book however, changed my whole view of the genre. A slick, well-crafted novel from cover to cover. One of the best opening lines to a novel that I have ever come across, enchanting characters, and the promise of a journey grand in scope for the other two books in the series makes this a must-read for anyone who likes fantasy!I only give it a four-star rating because I save my five-star ratings for books that really make me think.

There are many who say that this book incorporates the \\"usual\\" cast of elves, dwarves, Kings, and all that other fantasy jazz that usually appears in books. But what is the problem with putting the original dwarves, elves, and all those other races into a book? This is a traditional story with many new and exciting twists. The characters were well-developed for a young author and Mr. Paolini had much talent and skill. His craft is a wonderful piece of literature that I will always be a fan of.

Sure, it was written by a guy who was 17, that is fine. Here are the facts, it is real easy to read because it is not bogged down by too much excessively written detail. The detail is there to paint a decent picture of the world the characters live in. The characterization is, in my opinion well thought out. You learn about the characters through the course of the story, it doesn't say from the beginning exactly what you can expect of each character. In that manner their is a lot to learn about each character and plenty to keep the non-snobbish readers going. Does the story have flaws, yes, is there stories out there a book out there that cannont be better based on each individual writers tastes, No. The young writer of this story has a lot to learn about yet, that much is apparant. My opinion is this though, for a first novel, he did a bang up job and I can't wait to wrap my fingers around the second novel in the series. Are all the ideas in the book original, not really. Here are the facts about good fiction though, and this is from the perspective of a comic book fan: The good guys will always win, that is ALMOST always the case, but just because you know that, it doens't make the story bad, the important part is how the end comes, what sacrifices must be made by the main character/characters. The journey is the story. In this case the writer has taken ideas written about by other authors (dragon riders are indicative to Ann McCaffy's work), and made them his own, there is no shame in that. In conclusion, this is a good book that I feel is a breeze to read through."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"***This review contains spoilers***Other than Harry Potter, popular mainstream fantasy fiction seems to be all but dead. Head to the fantasy section in your local bookstore and what do you see? Hundreds and hundreds of fantasy novels, none of them standing out above the rest. A fantasy novel has to do something to distinguish itself if its going to be noticed by someone who doesn't really care about fantasy, like me. Eragon, with its attractive cover and \\"written by a kid\\" marketing campaign, did just that.Overall the story is basically your typical \\"Seemingly normal man discovers a destiny greater than he ever imagined\\" type of deal, and make no mistake about it, many of the characters are outright rip-offs from other popular movies/books or boring archetypes. The Brom character is the most obvious of these, being analogous Obi-Wan Kenobi or Gandalf, and Eragon himself may as well be named Luke. In fact, the characters were so cliched that I was actually shocked that Eragon himself didn't turn out to be the son of Morzan, although Paolini only took it one step from that with turning Eragon's eventual comrade into just that. There's many problems with the writing itself as well. First off, Paolini will try to turn something into a \\"big reveal\\" that was completely obvious to the reader. Is there a single person who read this book that didn't know Brom was once a Dragon Rider from the first time he spoke? That's related to another problem; stupid characters. Brom tells Eragon that all Dragon Riders can use magic, and Brom teaches Eragon tons of magic, and yet Eragon never asks, or even suspects, that Brom was once a Rider? Please. Some of the dialogue is also cringe-worthy, especially some of Saphira's. Early on it sounds as if she is trying to make her sentences into mysterious monologues. This is really annoying, although the dialogue does improve over time.That said, the world is rich, and if you aren't really a reader of fantasy but are willing to give something a shot, you will probably enjoy this."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love making fun if the kids and that kid who made fun of Mongomerey is right he is an idiot.

Yep, it reminds me of those carefree days of youth. And for the young reader, or the child in you, I very much recommend Eragon , a first novel, and first in a new fantasy trilogy by young author Christopher Paolini.Eragon is a classic coming of age story, with fresh writing, and new perspective. Yes, there is magic and dragons, and a young hero coming to terms with responsibility and adulthood, and an evil, corrupt king to trust his growing powers. All classic elements of the fantasy genre, but the story and the characters drive the tale, giving solid footing to well-worn foundations.Eragon is a solid first novel, and there's great promise in Christopher Paolini. He was only sixteen when he penned this novel. If you are a reader of fantasy, you'll see influence from masters of the genre-such as Tolkien, and Ann McCaffrey, and even elements of the Star Wars saga. But I like to think good story telling transcends the boundaries of genre, and this is a book with sound plot, good character development, and an epic tale to lose yourself. I found Eragon to be one of those rare books I never wanted to end, but luckily the next book in the trilogy, Eldest, has been released.

The book was so good that it was made into a movie, but the book is 100 times better than the book because the movie didn't even go by the storyline. The book may look huge but the reason for that is because of all of the great writing and action that is needed to make it such a great book.Eragon will be the best book that you will ever read. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ERAGONEragon is about a boy, Eragon who finds a mysterious stone. The stone he found in the spine, a mountain chain that is very mysterious. The stone hatches and becomes a dragon and he hides the dragon for fear that his uncle will kill it. Little does he know if he had shown the dragon to his uncle and his uncle killed it he possibly could have died. Later his dragon, Saphira, who doesn't want him hurt, kidnaps him. When Eragon gets back to the farm he find his uncle mortally wounded. After his uncle dies he pursues the Razac, which are creatures that do the kings bidding. After a while he ends up in the dwarf capital Farthen Dur. After a time of uneasiness with the dwarfs a battle ensues in which the shade Durza is killed by Eragon and Saphira breathes fire.My favorite part of the book is probably when the Urgals who are much like orcs from Lord of the Rings attack and they nearly overwhelm the dwarfs. The dwarves fight gallantly and after Saphira is injured Eragon flies to the dragon hold and they remove her armor, Eragon finds that the hall below them has Urgals tunneling in and it would be to slow to take the stairs so he takes the slide which is just cut into the mountain. After he gets down the stairs Durza, the shade breaks through the floor and a duel ensues and Saphira breaks thought the floor and Durza looks up and Eragon stabs him in the heart.I would recommend this book to any body that likes fantasy books. This book I thought was good beacouse I think that it is an adventure/fantasy/action."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon: Christopher PaoliniReview author: Kyle Stanton White Plains, New York.Knopf Books for Young Readers (August 10, 2004)ISBN-10: 0375826688Alagasia is made up of very beautiful waterfalls, plains, and different species living in harmony. All of this was great until the evil King Galbatorix disrupted all of that. Only one person of an extinct race called the Dragon Riders can help overcome the impossible odds and destroy Galbatorix. Can he do that or will he fail? Eragon is a great fantasy book written by Christopher Paolini.Eragon is a 15-year old farm boy. He finds a marvelous blue stone while hunting. Before he can trade it for food. It hatches into a dragon. Eragon decides to name it Saphira after one of the legendary dragons. They both begin to bond together. When Uncle Garrow was murdered by the malicious Ra'Zac. Eragon swore vegence againest the King. I think that the King was very cruel to send the Ra'Zac to kill Garrow. If this happened then Galbortorix wouldn't have gaoned yet another enemy.When Brom, the town storyteller, accompanied Eragon to the Varden so they can join the rebel group to help destroy Galbortorix, they encounter the Ra'Zac again. This time they claimed another life. Eragon is then accompanied by Murtagh. They then continue their journery to the rebel group the Varden. I think Eragon is one of those rare one of a kind books. I think Christopher Paolini incorporates great language and feelings. The plot is very good. I think the idea is very original.When Eragon came out it topped the charts! It made the top ten list. All this is very impressive for a 17 year old author. I highly recommend this book to mostly older readers. I think the language, action, and plot will definetly make it hard to put down for the reader. The book is a great fantasy book the older readers.

Fiction has been set aside along with fast food, tv, and too much ice cream. 99% of my book purchases have been non-fiction geared towards learning for the last five years.For some reason (maybe because the name reminds me of Aragorn?) I picked Eragon up while on my way to check-out at a popular store. It was cheap, I thought I would flip through it or who knows what. Well I read the first two pages, and then proceeded to get nothing useful done for the rest of my weekend! How wonderful to be reminded of my youthful summers lost in other worlds...In Summary: don't start reading this book if you are pressed for time to complete important chores, such as cleaning the house for visitors or studying for a test...you'll get nothing done for two days while engrossed in Eragon's story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an exceptional accomplishment for such a young author.

I finished it once, and I liked it so much, I'm reading it again. I love Christopher Paolini's web site and the ideas of places and things inside Alagaesia, such as Helgrind and Uru Baen. But be warned: it has a cliffhanger ending. Once again, this is a really good book, and I suggest that you buy it whenever you can. Christopher's web site is www.alagaesia.com. I had to tear my eyes off this book, it was so good. Eragon is a very gifted boy. One reason is he's named after an elf. Not far in the book be becomes a Dragon Rider.

I would like to say it was one of those books you just cant put down, but it really isnt one of those. It is the type of book that is a really great read but if you try and compare it to fantasy masterpeices such as Lord of the Rings, then it doesn't really seem good at all. That is the reason why you SHOULD'T compare it to a masterpeice like that, it is truly unfair to this young author Christopher Paolini to do that. This book is finely edited and well written, but it seems to struggle to be the next great epic. you could say it shouts when a whisper would do just fine, but that is also what makes this book interesting. It is in fact so in depth, not rack your brain, but I mean the complexity of the world, and the characters and their relationships is a true marvel to read. ... Anyway I would give this book a 8.75/10, meaning you should go pick it up!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a compelling book that draws you in from the beginning. Christopher Paolini started writing the book when he was just 15 and finished it when he was 18. It shows that he has quite a talent for writing fantasy and fiction. Eragon has obviously had quite an influence from Tolkien, hence a mythical world containing dragons, elves, dwarfs, men, urgals (almost orcs), shades and of course a dark lord named Galbatorix.While living with his uncle, Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a mysterious blue rock, or so he thinks. The rock, turning out to be an egg, hatches into a beautiful sapphire blue dragon. The raging Ra'zac, an odd race of creatures searching for the egg and working for Galbatorix, turn up in Carvahall, Eragorn's hometown. Searching for the egg, they tear apart Eragon's home and kill his uncle. In a thrilling search for revenge, Eragon and his dragon, Sapphira, learn magic, sword fighting, reading, loving and best yet, flying. Eragon's journey takes him through perils far greater then imaginable, pleasures worth a lifetime of memories, and the bitter feeling of pain.This is easily my favorite book, and that is a lot to say from a kid that reads two hours per day. The story is a blend of fighting and peace, love and hate, life and death along with good and evil. This may not be for adults, but this book is a wonderland for most kids everywhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a great book.

I read the summary and began the book, I couldn't look up, not if I miss an important chunk of info about Eragon or his dragon. The book had everything I like, the fantasy and the excitment, mystery and tragedy, adventure and a feeling that something really bad was going to happen and most of the time it did. The book is mostly about a young farmer boy named Eragon who stumbles upon a strange stone that is all blue and white. This \\"stone\\" as it turns out is actually a dragon egg, after it hatches Eragon is pushed into a world of magic, of power, of greed and of love as an evil king hunts him down. Together, Eragon and Saphira struggle to survive and strive in cruel world in which you trust nobody until they save you and kill anybody who is against you.

Eragon needs to learn how to defeat the perilous forces controled by the evil King who rules the Empire.I, myself found Eragon a great read. It has a fast paced storyline with alot of action, and adventure. It gives enough detail for you to understand what's happening but at the same time keeps its break-neck pace. This is my first book that I re-read, mainly because of the storyline, and fierce action sequences. Eragon shows that fast-paced storyline and a detailed story, is possible to combine.Comparing Eragon to other fantasy, I found that there are many gaps that authors avoid when writing fantasy, that Eragon cover in a full manner. I was quite impressed on how well Paolini covered the subject of magic without the reader guessing what Eragon can and cant do. Paolini's book explained magic alot greater then I expected. Another achevement Paolini pulled off, is keeping the story true to form. I know from reading experience, fantasy often lacks realism in their books.The book has many highlights, but there is some places Paolini stumbled in creating this book. One area the book lacked in is how the fast-paced story bogged down near the end. Another dislike is how Paolini ended the book. The end was left far too open, with too many questions that appeared from nowhere.Overall, I think Eragon is a great book for young and old."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Three days!

Great work Mr. Poalini!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Three stars? Naw. Two stars? Naw. I wish there was a 2.5 star rating. I will give it 3 stars, just to be nice.The only real problem with this book is that it was written by a 15 year old boy who really does not understand the subtleties of writing in any genre, let alone fantasy. I think it could be reasonably argued that this is a stand alone Tolkien rip off of the inth degree. That said, when I found out it was written by some one so young I was dumbfounded at how good it was. Could I have written something like this when I was 15 years old? Well... Me, yah I could have. (ha ha) But it is an incredible feet non the less!The story is engaging. My one problem with the language was that it was too modern in places, which tended to pull me out of Eragon's world. Also, I could not help the fact that every time I saw the word \\"Eragon\\" on the page I thought of Tolkien. Surely, even a 15 year old would know that that was too close to Aragorn, and that would be looked upon poorly by Tolkien fans. Would it have been so hard to be a bit more original?Much of the story was drawn out. I believe that the story could have been told in a book half the size of this one. Descriptions are lovely, and really bring a story to life WHEN they are done properly, but they can also hinder the progression of a story when they are just thrown in in what seems like a completely random way. Through the first half of the book there is a lot of traveling and fighting. We don't learn anything new about the characters... chapter after chapter. And what is with the chapter lengths? Some chapters were only a page and half long! I found that to be rather ridicules.Another complaint of mine is that there was far too much dependence on adverbs. It is important to show the action. Not just write about it. How and why is something behaving \\"intently\\", for example or \\"hesitantly.\\" If someone said something \\"quietly\\"... How was it quiet? Why was it said? What was the inflection in the voice that made you think it was quiet? Adverbs are the downfall of a good writer. I learned in one of my creative writing classes \\"Show, don't tell!\\" Never use adverbs unless you have no other choice, and in this story every other sentence ended with an adverb.The story did get better though about half way through. When Eragon got to the Varden strong hold it really did start to peak my interest. The final battle of this story is great! I found myself wanting to know what happened next. I suppose I will have to read book 2 \\"Eldest\\" when it is released, just to find out what happens to Eragon, Murtagh, and Arya.Overall, I have to say... I didn't hate it. It wasn't the best thing I have ever read, but it wasn't awful either, especially considering it was written by some one so young. I think Paolini has the potential to be a fine writer someday... with practice.Peace and Love,"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a pretty big fan of fantasy books and loved this one. It takes a chapter or two to get into but after that it's awesome! The story is about a guy, named Eragon who finds a dragon egg. When the dragon hatches he hides it in the forest and goes to visit it. In Eragon's world there are a group of people who rule his world. All of them are dragon riders. Dragon eggs only hatch for the people who are destined to ride them, which is what Eragon finds out. The dragon riders had been trying to find someone that would make the egg hatch before, but it never happened. When the egg was left in the forest Eragon had found it. Little did he know he was destined to be a dragon rider. I don't want to give the whole story away so I'll stop there.But this is a really good book and it has a lot in common with The Lord of the Rings. I would say this book is for all ages, my mom has read it and she loved it too. I can't wait for the movie! I personally think Sean Biggerstaff would be a good Eragon, but that could just be me. I loved this book a lot more than Harry Potter. I am dying to read the next book. I loved Eragon from beginning to end. Hopefully the next book will be just as good as this one was."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book caught my attention right away, I couldn't stop reading it! Christopher has taken the classic genre and twisted it to make it original. This book was very inspiring for me, as I am also a young writer. This author has given me more confidence in my own work. I don't think this book meaures up to Tolkien's writing, but a good yarn nonetheless."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I liked this book a lot. It was really good. It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever read, not by a long shot, but it is still good.Paolini has made something that I wish I could. I want to write, and I've written a few short stories, but as I read Eragon, I thought, \\"I could never do this by the time I was legal.\\" And I think that it isn't so much the story or the characters or the land of Alagaesia that amazes some so much with this novel. It is Paolini's skill at his age.The story is about this farm boy who finds a stone in the mountains, thinking it'll buy him and his family meat for the winter. But when a trader appraises it, the farm boy finds out that it is hollow, and shortly after, a dragon is hatched. So begins the journey of Eragon. He learns to communicate with the dragon, and even finds the stereotypical wise old man who knows more than he's letting on to go with him. He seeks revenge on the people who killed his uncle, and avoids being captured (except once) by the Empire. He joins a group called the Varden, and fights an epic battle. He slays an almost unslayable beast, and he even gets a possible love interest.There are two main problems with this book, in my opinion. One: Speaker tags.Big whoop, right? Speaker tags. Hear me out.Some authors use adverbs, i.e.:\\"That's a funny joke,\\" said Mr. X cheerily.Or they might use action.\\"That's a funny joke.\\" Mr X. laughed hysterically at the joke.But Paolini does:\\"That's a funny joke,\\" Mr. X laughed.I swear, he must have used every single form of the word \\"said\\" known to man. (\\"Sorry,\\" Brom apologized.) It got annoying sometimes.Paolini tries to work in a lot of description (which is fine), whether it is in the tags or if it is in regular text, but a lot of times we don't need it:\\"Oh, look, your dragon's breathing fire,\\" said Mr. X. The blue scales of the dragon were barely visible from the glare of the flame.Wouldn't you rather hear about the dragon breathing fire than the dragon's blue scales? Or you could just cut the description altogether.And my second big problem is other fantasy references. While very few authors can say, truthfully, \\"I have never stolen ideas for books in my life,\\" the many similarities between this book and the Hobbit or LotR are to apparent to be just something that Paolini skimmed over.Will I finish the series? Yes. Will I ever read the book again? Maybe. Because as good as this is, you can find better ways to spend your time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Although Christopher Paolini must be commended for writing a huge novel at the age of fifteen, his creativity does not deserve the same. The overall plot is that a boy, Eragon, finds a valuable \\"gem\\" that happens to be a dragon egg, which subsequently hatches. He becomes a Dragon Rider (read: \\"The Dragon Riders of Pern\\"), who have been extinct for hundreds of years (read: \\"Star Wars\\" jedi). He goes on and travels across the continent to his destination (which turns out to be a volcano: sort of like Mount Doom from \\"Lord of the Rings\\"), meets a lone voyager along the way, who just happens to have a secret, dangerous past and who also agrees to help Eragon to his destination (read: Aragorn from \\"Lord of the Rings\\"). There are evil beings that are not really alive nor dead and ride dragons, searching for the egg that the boy found (read: the Nazgul or the Black Riders from \\"Lord of the Rings\\"). Even the names of places are too coincidental to not be copied (read: Isenstar -> Isengard?).Not only that, but Paolini's writing style is not very smooth. It is difficult for most high schoolers and older persons to get into the action in the book because the disrupted writing flow prevents that. For middle schoolers and younger, however, this book is a hit, because they focus mostly on action, which this novel has plenty of. Sometimes the action is simply strange and doesn't seem to fit, but most of the time it works fine. The vocabulary is also exceptional, but it may be a bit too much.Overall, I believe that Paolini has gotten a head start, thanks to his age, and I hope that he will work to improve his writing. A good writer always strives to improve; I will be eagerly watching Paolini's career for this."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In this, his first published novel, Paolini does not create any new themes, story lines, or characters. Rather, he takes several popular characters from other sources and molds them to his needs. Likewise, the story lines of bad king versus good-but-outnumbered rebels, young innocent farm boy evolving into heroic warrior, etc. are hardly unknown to the science fiction genre but are nonetheless well handled by Paolini in creating a highly readable and entertaining story. While Paolini may not be a creator of totally new concepts, he certainly shows himself skilled at adaptation and improvisation, building a good read out of old materials.The reader will easily recognize many influences on the author as he created the novel Eragon. Anne McCaffrey's series of novels about the dragonriders of Pern are an obvious influence, but I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels have had even a greater influence than McCaffrey's works. Some parallels with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories can be argued, and the \\"Evil Empire\\" against which the rebels struggle evokes images of the Star Wars motion pictures. Readers familiar with these various sources will quickly see Paolini's Brom as the counterpart of Tolkien's Gandolf. Paolini's Urgals are dead ringers for Tolkien's Orcs. The Elfin race goes by the same name in both Paolini and Tolkien. Paolini's two Ra'zacs remind one of Tolkien's nine Nazgul. The words that Eragon uses to lift stones and cast destruction on his enemies suggest the magic of Rowling's Harry Potter. And on and on go the parallels.Paolini's strength, however, lies not in the direct retelling of any of his source materials but in the adaptation of the sources' character types to his own ends. His novel is not a close variation of any of his sources' story lines but is his own creation. That the reader recognizes others' characters reborn in Paolini's work actually makes them even more endearing. Here are some of the old friends that we first met in other books reborn into a new environment and a different time. Their resurrection is pleasant and we are happy to see them in action once more.Unhappily, a very few grammatical errors found their way past both the author and his proofreaders. While these are but few, they still assault readers' sensibilities and leave behind a most unpleasant residue in their minds. In each instance, these involve the use of the first person objective case pronoun when use of the nominative case is appropriate. These would probably not be so jarring were overall usage elsewhere in the novel less excellent.In sum, I believe that those who have has enjoyed McCaffrey's dragonrider novels or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will also enjoy Paolini's Eragon. If one has read neither McCaffrey nor Tolkien but still enjoys an adventure fraught with peril, magic, a few monsters, and a sentient dragon, then I would still feel safe in recommending Paolini. On the other hand, if a reader seeks classical conflict, detailed character development, and the relief of an effective denouement at the end of it all, then he probably shouldn't be looking for a novel in the modern science fiction genre in the first place! I am anticipating Paolini's next novel in what he calls the Inheritance Triology with eagerness."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One of the most important aspects of being an artist is the ability to be sincere in your work. From sincerity comes vision, and from vision great stories are born. However, sincerity and vision alone do not a great novel make. Raw enthusiasm must also be tempered with technique and discipline. While Eragon strikes me as a book written from the heart, I do not believe Mr. Paolini has yet discovered his narrative voice.I found the writing in Eragon to be a bit dry, especially when it comes to his choice of descriptive words and sentence structure. While Paolini certainly chooses words that are adequate for describing the scenes and characters, they lack that certain dramatic flair that grabs the reader's attention. Some sections felt downright mechanical. This especially shows in the dialogue. For a country bumpkin farm boy, Eragon and his family are amazingly sophisticated in their speech patterns.However, if you can look past the aforementioned fault, you will find an entertaining story here. I'm a huge fan of dragons, and Saphira is a very interesting character. I feel she practically breathes life into the scenes. Some argue that the plot is archetypical, and I agree. Eragon isn't exactly the most original fantasy novel out there. Take the Brom character, for instance. Hmmm, now where else have I seen a wise old man who seems to know everything about everything, and loves nothing more than to puff his pipe and blow smoke rings into the air?However, let's be realistic. Who in their right minds expects a 17 year old kid to write on Tolkein's level? Perhaps a child prodigy who works as a medical doctor at the age of 16, but us mere mortals have faults. I believe it's a credit to Paolini's intelligence that he wrote a book at all. It's all too easy to point fingers and find faults while failing to give credit where it's due.That said, I believe Paolini has some raw talent which he must mold with discipline and technique. If nothing else, I believe Eragon is a good read for children and young adults. It's also good as a start for those who aren't into fantasy books. I can easily imagine Eragon being seen as incredible to those for whom this book is their first taste of fantasy. For the Tolkein fan boys and fantasy aficionados out there, I recommend steering clear of this one. It won't live up to your lofty biases and expectations.I give it a 4 as a young adult read. A 3 for adults."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If there was a way of giving zero stars, I would!This is a total rip-off of all bland squee-High Fantasy there ever was, plus Tolkien, and a hint of Pern -(...).The only reason that book got published is that the kid's father owns the publishing company; otherwise, it would have remained unread in the depths of ff.net where it would by rights belong.The only thing I totally don't understand is why so many people actually like it - are they daft or what?? Can't they read?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I won't echo the other comments about how the work is unoriginal or taken from other writers. I didn't care too much about that, mainly because I couldn't get past the horrible use of language. I think this book got caught up in the whole \\"the writer's 18 years old!\\" hype. Had this book been written by Robert Jordan and published as a Wheel of Time novel, it would have been flambayed.The use of the English language is absolutely horrible, for all the reasons described in the reviews below, and I blame this not on Paolini's education, but on his editors, who failed to clean up this book into something readable. Maybe some of you can get past it, but I couldn't."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My best friend advised me not to read this book. But, she's a bit of an elitist, so I figured, what the heck? I mean, I like plenty of things she finds annoying or stupid. I was wrong. Here is my honest impression of the book:First chapter: This isn't so bad.. a bit melodramatic.. but not badQuarter of the way through the book: He is not going there, is he?Third of the way through: OH GOD!!!! He went there!!!Halfway: Please, please stop this... oh no, he's borrowing from everything I hold dear!Three quarters: *Mouth open in disbelief* This is TERRIBLE!!!End of book: Why, why didn't I listen?I recently saw the trailer and thought \\"Wow, that really reminds me of A New Hope.You know, the scene where Luke is looking off into the sunset..\\" It isn't the unoriginality that made me hate the book, or the bloody mess Young Sky - I mean, Paolini made of the archetypes in the book, it was the tone the author used. That smug, smug tone.This fills me with sadness for all the good writers out there who don't have the rich, influential parents to push their work to the top of the stack."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this a few years ago because it was the latest craze. A fifteen year old (who finished it when he was 19) wrote a 550 page book! Most teenagers aren't exactly great writers, so I felt I had to check this out.The book? 550 pages of derivativeness, pointless description (especially that of a certain elf's cleavage), and a carbon copy of Star Wars. For starters, 80% of the book is description of either the terrain or of hot elves, and yet I have no idea what the main character looks like. Not to mention the fact that Paolini obviously wrote it with a thesauras by his side. Machicolated?! We have no idea either. I'm not sure whether that was in Eragon, or Eldest, but what the hey?And then the plot. Yaargh. Take Star Wars, set it in medieval times, replace robots with dragons, and take out any originality. That's basically the plot. And as for Eldest, take everything I said here and multiply it by 5. Yup. It's that bad."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I give the author a bit of credit for his age, but other than that, this book does not deserve the press it has received. He takes from other works (Star Wars, Tolkien, etc) , almost to the point of embarrasment. The story becomes tedious after awhile, but does gain a bit of momentum at the end.Perhaps the second book is better than the first."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am an avid reader and a great fan of classic fantasy, yet I don't generally concern myself with any new fantasy. So when I received this book as a gift, I knew nothing about it. After I was about 100 pages into it, I couldn't help but have the following thoughts: This seems like it was written by a highschool student; It is incredibly formulaic; This is shockingly simliar to LOTR and Earthsea. I will say that I was not particularly surprised to find out this was in fact written by a 17 year old. So in answer to the people who argued that the negative reviews are influenced by knowing the writers age; I had no idea and I still found it juvenile. The bottom line is: if you are any lover of classic fantasy, don't read this book, as it will only make you angry.Here are my observations on the specific plaigarisms:Tolkien: Elves are immortal, and come across the sea. Dwarves are reclusive and have great cities underground. Urgals are ugly beasts with a love for killing. Does this sound familiar? 75% of the place names are either: direct rip-offs (Melian, Beor), anagrams (Beirland, Furnost), or structured the exact same way (S&iacute;lthrim, N&auml;dindel, Cithr&iacute;). Then there is of course the old guide, who is seemingly benign but with hidden powers and a mysterious origin.LeGuin: This may be the smallest plaigarism in the scope of the entire book, but it is the most blatant. The entire system of magic based upon knowing the true names of things is taken directly from the EarthSea series, with little changes.These plaigarisms aren't so much a matter of legality, but just of creating something original. The fact is that there is nothing original in this book to hold the interest of anyone who has read their share of fantasy. This is basically a highschool students over-hyped, somewhat disguised \\"fanfic\\"."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was quite surprised to find out that \\"Eragon\\" was written by a fifteen-year old because Paolini's work definitely rivals that of J.K.

I enjoyed reading the book but it gave me nothing to ponder. But a good read for Tolkien fans."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. The story is very captivating and the characters are very interesting. At the beginning of the story you see how the humans live, but as the story enters its third quarter, you get a view of how the dwarves and Varden, which is a group of rebles against an evil king, live and interact with each other. You also get a glimpse at how the elves live because of Arya, an elf. Throughout the whole story the plot is captivating and interesting, and even when the story seems a little dull, a fight occurs or a major event happens, and that sweeps away all the slight boredom in the story. The plot is also excellent, with vivid descriptions for beautiful landscapes.You also get a great view of how Eragon,the main character,feels about the entire situation. Throughout the entire story Eragon communicates with his dragon Saphira telepathically,which not only reveals his thoughts but his feelings as well. Saphira also responds to Eragon's statements with an intelligence, not only equaling but sometimes surpassing Eragon's. Because of this communication with each other, readers can feel as if they are truly close to them both.This book may have been written by someone still in their teens, but it shows such a level of description and talent, that it rivals some of the best fantasy books I have ever read. This book might even be my favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, as I have seen in many of the other reviews, some people do not take kids opinions on this book that seriously. Some of the other people believe that because kids are just finding an interest in fiction literature, that they are captivated by this book, instead of reading books that they think are better because they have similar ideas. Other people believe that Christopher Paolini took his favorite author's ideas and made a book consisting of many of these ideas, but all mixed together. I, on the other hand, have read just as many of these books, if not more, and I still think that Eragon comes out on top. Christopher Paolini took these ideas from other stories and expanded them in ways that the other authors never could. He took beautifully rendered landscapes, interesting characters, an exciting story plot, and put them in a way that is both loved by children and adults. Although some may argue that Tolkien or other fiction writers used the same ideas but better, in my eyes there is no competition. Eragon is one of the best stories I have ever read and that is why I give it a 5."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First of all, I am an adult and 50-something parent who read the book to screen it for my 12-year old son. While I agree with other reviewers that Christopher Paolini clearly \\"borrowed\\" ideas from Tolkien, Star Wars, Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" and other similar sci-fi/fantasy literature, my comment is, \\"So what?\\" With the notable exceptions of Tolkien and Anne McCaffrey, I believe most sci-fi/fantasy all contain certain similar characters, races and ideas. I have no problem with that as long as the story itself is good and well-written. I have read hundreds of sci-fi/fantasy books.Eragon is a young farm boy whose name is the title. He lives with his uncle and his cousin,Roran, on a farm just outside the small village of Carvahall. Eragon is good with his bow and is out doing the hunting for food for his family up in the mountains or Spine. He is chasing after a wounded doe when he comes across a beautiful and huge blue stone. It is highly polished and marbled and over a foot in length. Eragon decides that since he couldn't kill their food, he will take the stone to the village and see what he can get for it to buy some food. The butcher he goes to does not want to trade him meat for the stone even though winter is coming and Eragon's family would go hungry. A kind friend, the blacksmith, comes in the shop and pays for the food but tells Eragon he can work it off in the spring and to just keep the stone.Roran makes plans and leave the farm in the next couple of weeks so Eragon is all the help that Garrow, his uncle, has. Eragon has hidden the stone but takes it out frequently to look at it. One day the egg hatches and a beautiful gleaming blue dragon appears. From storyteller Brom and others, Eragon though dragons were no longer on earth. Eragon makes the dragon a hideout up in a tree and orders it to stay in the woods while he goes to talk to Brom as Brom used to tell tales of dragons and the Riders. Having learned from Brom a little more about dragons, Eragon names the dragon, who turns out to be female, Saphira. Saphira is growing VERY rapidly. Eragon and Saphira have also formed a mental bond.When the evil Ra'zac kill Garrow, Eragon's uncle, and destroy the farm, Eragon finds out from the Brom that the Ra'zac are after him and his dragon. King Galbatorix wants to be the only Rider and not have his power threatened by another Rider. Galbatorix had destroyed almost all Riders in the past on his way to power. Brom accompanies Eragon on his flight to search for the Ra'zac that killed his uncle and learn more of his role as a Rider.Brom and Eragon have many adventures and battles as Brom trains Eragon in magic and in sword fighting as well as more of the history of his country. Besides humans, dragons and Ra'zac, there are also elves, dwarves, Shades and rather primitive and violent humans called Urgals.I enjoyed the story myself and know my son will like it too. I disagree with the publisher's age range, however. I would recommend it for 12 year olds minimum."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recently began to work in a book store in the young adults science-fiction section. The week I began working there the second book in the Inheritance Trilogy \\"Eldest\\" was released in hard cover. Naturally, all of the buzz that Eldest was making made me curious to pick up the series, so I started with the first book in the series, \\"Eragon\\". I was pleasantly surprised with the story that I discovered.The book begins with Eragon's trip into the Spine on a hunting expedition. Eragon is a 15 year old bastard son of Selena, a woman who left him to be raised by his Uncle Garrow and Aunt Marion. On this fateful trip into the Spine Eragon finds what he thinks to be a harmless precious stone and decides to take it home to see if it will fetch a price with the traders. Some time later he discovers that it is, in fact, a dragon's egg when it hatches in his room one evening, and he has more surprises in store for him when he realizes that the dragon has formed a bond with his mind, one that he is unable and unwilling to break. This bond comes with a price though; as far as Eragon knows all of the dragon riders had died out a long time ago, as all of the dragons were virtually extinct. So where, in fact, did this egg come from?Eragon is forced into a quest when a band of Urgals slaughters his family and wreaks havoc upon his village. He decides to seek vengeance for the murder of his family and begins a quest across Alagaesia to find those responsible. He sets out with Brom, a man whom he believes to be an ordinary story teller but in truth knows a bit too much about dragon lore and truths to really be all that he seems to be. Together, they will discover that underneath everything they know is an underlying plot that will change the empire and discover some new intrigues along the way.This book turned out to be a delight, well worth the read in my estimation. I enjoyed it so much that I had to pick up Eldest immediately following. The characters are engaging, flawed and perfected, people that you actually end up giving a damn about. The story is straight forward fantasy fare, with some new twists and interesting explorations of typical fantasy occurrences. It actually reminded me a touch of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain series, though I can't really say why, perhaps some of the way in which the material was presented. There were parts in it that were clearly aimed at younger readers, but the fact that the author was 17 when he wrote it may be why there are those initial flaws. The way that some of the dialogue came off was a bit clich&eacute; of the fantasy genre. I'll be honest, there was some dialogue that was so cheesy I shook my head abashed, I just couldn't believe the author had written it, or that an editor let it fly. However, this book is intended at young audiences, and this is typical with that genre. On the other hand, I have read fantasy that was aimed at adults that was written much worse than what I encountered here, so in lieu of that I am likely to dismiss these slights. Overall, I am hesitant to give it five stars, but four seems under doing it. Figure 4 and a half or so, only because of the slight imperfections in the dialogue. It's definitely worth the hype."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a wonderful book to start out with your fantasy adventures in. It has the feel of the Lord of the Rings with the ease of Harry Potter. Though it falters in some places where it leaves you hanging, it will explain what is happening to Eragon and his beloved dragon, Saphira. I strongly encourage one to continue to read in the fantasy lines of the great writers of the past to help with the understanding of where this 17 year old got his inspiration from. He has a bright future in front of him in the fantasy realm, but needs to stray from the path of Tolkien to forge his one way."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ERAGON is one of the best books i have ever read and i strongly suggest it to anyone who likes fantasy and adventure and dont be fooled by its cover i thought i might be making a mistake when i was in the checkout i thought it might be some little fairy tale bed time book for kids BUT ITS NOT there are lots of grusome details and thats just fine with me. i recomend this book to all ages"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First, just for the record, these are some of the worst reviews I've ever seen.

The plot and characters have depth and history; Eragon, the hero, is someone teens can relate to. He goes through some real problems (like bullying, crushes) that kids face today. The bond between Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, is extrodinary and very touching. No matter what he does, Eragon always has a friend he can count on.

One day when Eragon was hunting in the spine one day when he found a bright blue object he thinks is a rock. The rock later known as egg hatches and an old story teller, who tells stories about the dragon riders, known as Brom finds out. Brom takes Eragon far away from Carvahal to protect Eragon from the deadly razac that killed Garrow. Brom teaches Eragon how to fight with a sword and how to fly a dragon, Brom even made a dragon sadle for Safira witch as you might have guessed is the name of Eragon's dragon. Later in the book Eragon learns how to use magic and Brom sacrifices him self to save Eragon from the razac. But if it weren't for Murtah(a very good hunter that hates the razac) Eragon would have died as well. Murtah and Eragon become friends but Murtah is very sneaky and keeps lots of secrets from Eragon.

Galbratorix is good at magic and amazing at hacking into peoples minds. Galbratorix's goal is to kill Eragon.Eragon is a book that will grab you and take you along for the ride! This action packed book is good for all ages 10 and above because of violence. It not only tells you Eragon's view but both sides of the story as well!

First things first: Paolini wrote Eragon when he was 15. It's a pretty impressive work--for a 15 year old. He's just published book 4 of the series; I hope, for his sake, his writing has gotten better. But even not considering the age of the writer, Eragon is more like good fan fiction than an original work.In terms of plot, the parallels to Star Wars are so numerous that it became downright ridiculous. The setting is Tolkien-esque, with elves, dwarves, and men, but the plot is all Star Wars. Did he realize this when he was writing? Is it coincidence, plagiarism, or tribute? I don't know. I'm not a big fantasy reader (other than Tolkien) but my suspicion as I read, confirmed by other reviews, was that many of the other story elements here are derivative from other fantasy writers.None of this is to say that Eragon is a bad book. It's not bad, it's just a weak imitation of much better books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is Christopher Paolini's debut novel about a young boy who finds a dragon and discovers he is a dragon rider. With the help of his mentor Brom, Eragon sets out to get revenge on the monsters who killed his uncle. On this journey, he discovers who he really is and just how far he will go to defeat the evil and powerful King.Okay. This is my second review of Eragon because the first time I only read 100 pages, declared it horrible, and stopped. While I still agree with most of the things I write in my first review (Solumbum?? That's seriously a name??), I've discovered not to judge a book by its first 100 pages.On continuing to read this book, I found that I liked it a lot more than I originally thought. The writing is still irksome at times, but Eragon and Saphira are great characters. I really like Arya and I'm looking forward to getting more from her. She reminds me of Holly from Artemis Fowl. The novel is one of those fantasy ones where you're not sure if you're reading the climax until it's over, which I tend to dislike, but it was good in this one. A lot happened in the book, and now that I'm trying to remember it all I'm finding it difficult. But I like when there's a lot of plot.On to *SPOILERS*. I could not BELIEVE that Brom died! I was seriously shocked. It seemed a bit too early for his mentor to die, though it was good luck that Murtagh happened to come along at that point in time. I suppose it's symbolic of Eragon finishing his training, but I think Brom didn't need to die to make that point. Also, did Brom die in the movie? I honestly can't remember.But anyway, what was with that ending? Why was he so upset that his back was \\"disfigured\\"? And now I'm five chapters into the second book and there's barely a mention of it. It's on your back, dude. Doesn't seem like a big deal. And then the book just ended! I was annoyed. I dislike when books just end. Thankfully the series is done now, so I don't have to wait to read more!I hear that Eragon is the only good book and they get worse from here. I'm willing to find out for myself. Eragon had all the necessary themes of coming-of-age and discovering who you are, as well as bravery and self-sacrifice. And I'm hoping Paolini just gets better with age. By the way, I love his notes to readers. He seems like such a nerd, and you can tell he's really grateful for the opportunities he's been given."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've read Eragon not once, but three times, and each time I have found it quite enjoyable. The story is not exactly unique, but in all honesty, what story ever is? Paolini gives a nod to Tolkein and other prominent fantasy writers in this tale, as they in turn gave a nod to older stories and legends in their works. The characters are flawed and very human, and they show a good amount of personal development throughout the story. The end is satisfying to the reader, with enough resolution to keep you happy, while leaving enough loose ends to make you crave the next installment. The pacing could use some work. The plot moves too quickly in some places and seems to drag in others, but never to the point where you no longer wished to continue reading. Many people love to point out that the author was very young when this book was written, which is true, but then the target audience is also young. In that respect, this book is exactly what it should be. It's right on target, an excellent read for the people it was meant to be read by. Overall, I'd say that if you are between the ages of twelve and sixteen, or are capable of reading a book for that age group without analyzing it to death, you will adore this story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"SPOILER ALERT!I had finnished the book this summer and thought it was awesome!

What I found is tried and true fantasy and good old fashioned story telling. It is true that there isn't much new here but who cares if it is entertains.I for one thought it was very good. The plot moves along with a lot of mystery and action. The characters are strong and their motivations are clear.

A few months after I finished reading it, I read it again, and then a third time just before Eldest was released. It has been, by far, my favorite series to read. I have heard people compare it to authors such as Tolken or Lucas and have heard complaints of it being \\"too similar\\" and I have to say that those complaints are only a very minuscule con of the series. I could pick up many different fantasy series and, if I searched with this intent, find many ways to \\"relate\\" them to previous best-sellers. The point is, when you look at the big picture, many books follow the typical \\"hero's quest\\". But when you look into the next layer with a bit more detail, this series is totally different from any of the others.Don't get me wrong, I love Tolken, Lucas, Brooks and the like, but I LOVE Paolini's work. To see this story come alive from the perspective of a younger author was amazing. He is very descriptive of people (or creatures), places, even feelings such as using magic, or grieving the loss of someone. Getting caught up in the story always makes me feel like I'm there while it's happening and that I'm feeling what the character is feeling.So as I stated in my title, if you are like I was and have just finished a series and are reaching out for something to \\"fill the gap\\" and start something new that will get you hooked, this is the book for you. I have loaned the book to friends who have started reading it and just couldn't put it down. They returned it two days later and said they were ready for the next one.

At least not yet."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There are two ways to look at this book, I think. One is from the standpoint of a new fantasy novel. The other is from the standpoint of a new fantasy novel written by someone so young. I'll say this right now: It is a great start for an author so young. It's pretty amazing someone going through the latter teenage years had the vision and dedication to write a novel like this.But just because he's still a teen doesn't protect him from the criticisms of having a major novel on shelves next to J.K. Rowling and Tom Clancy and other popular authors.Paolini borrows from other stories...a lot. I caught homages to Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Matrix, and of course, the Dragonriders of Pern series. I was able to accept this throughout the book. These stories are probably all the kid knows. He's bound to borrow from them. At times, it was tiring. At times, it made me smile. I think it's cute how one can tell how Paolini has cast himself in the part of Eragon. And, later in book, his description of Ajihad seems to be of none other than Morpheus from The Matrix. The question remains then: Was he able to craft a compelling story of his own from these elements?I think he achieved this to a point. Ultimately, I was bored through a lot of the book. I read a review which said there wasn't as much travelling as in Lord of the Rings. Are you kidding me? Most of this book is just that, travelling from one location to another. It seems like Paolini drew a map of his imagined world of Alagaesia and wanted to show as many of the locations as he could in 500 pages, while purposely leaving some areas a mystery for future novels. There were many chapters dedicated to the journey and only single chapters here and there about the destinations.A good bit of the book was also very formulaic, something I expected from someone Paolini's age, and which reflects how much he borrowed from other stories. This made much of the book predictable, and slow to read through.That said, I have one big positive remark, as well. I wondered as I read the book whether I would want to go on to his second book, Eldest, when it comes out. By the end of Eragon, I had decided I would want to. The story is nice enough and intriguing enough for me to want to find out what happens to the characters after the final pages. I am also looking forward to seeing if his writing matures, or if this book was the one good bullet in his gun, the rest all blanks.I say good luck to you, Christopher. You have tons of potential."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Look, the writing style is pleasant enough and generally inoffensive but... Eragon is Star Wars in a fantasy setting in almost every regard. It's completely unoriginal and really not worth the effort."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Others have raved over the high points of Eragon, while others have pointed out the blindingly obvious derivatives of classic fantasy authors (but let's be fair, Paolini is, thankfully, a far better writer than Dennis L. McKiernan). Instead, I'd like to point out the areas where the plot and structure collapsed.1) The names: they range all over the place from Greek names like Helen and Selena to names from the Eddas and even Wagner's operas. (Tip for future fantasy writers: assume your readers are *at least* as well-read and intelligent as you.) Now, a wide ethnic variety for names is a *good* thing--however, we're talking about a pre-industrial society, where names reflect the area the people live in. Too much variety in an isolated settlement makes no sense.2) The literacy factor: Eragon can't read or write (though how his literate kin managed to conduct their business while hiding this from him is not explained.) Yet within a few *months* at most, he is able to read and write at an advanced level. Any ESL or foreign language teacher would raise an eyebrow at that.3) He's much too articulate. Eragon has very noble sentiments and philosophies. How he learned these things (his continual balking at killing, for exampel--it makes NO sense coming from someone who grew up hunting and butchering his own animals for food.) His language is too well-developed, his ideals too lofty for an uneducated farm boy.3) The romance. *shudder* I'm sorry, Mr. Paolini. Perhaps it would have been better to keep this particular plot addition for the second book. It's wholly unrealistic, badly expressed. (BTW, 'obsession' and 'fevered madness' used in reference to powerful emotion are the same thing.) The love-interest is an idealized teenage male fantasy, everything a bout her is slim (including her sword), beautiful beyond compare, mysterious, yadda yadda. It was *painful* to read those sections.4) The dreaded fourtune-telling that delivers the entire plot.5) Over-use of magic. We're told early on that using magic is very dangerous, especially to somone without training. Yet after a few near-disasters, Eragon continues to use magic when there are better options available--and strangely, the 'hefty price' only kicks in when it serves the plot to have the hero collapse.Paolini has a gift with characters. Where he needs lots of work is his worldbuilding. There's nothing special about his world, not like \\"Tigana\\" or even \\"Narnia\\". I hope his later books show he's done some work in that area."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, a fantasy tale of a boy who is destined to become the next dragon rider, is an amazingly told story- for a seventeen year old to tell. This story, while it has little inspired plot- shows that the young author will in a few years, become a really promising talent in his field.The problem now is really the problem of youth- he's obviously got so many inspirations which he idolizes, and he wants to put them together in one book, yet he never makes any his own or brings any new material to the story. To be honeset this book was a bit like regurgated material and there was a lack of character development, intersting characters, or good dialouge, but it does show a spark of genius in this young man. A commendable work for a 17 year old, a poor contribution overall to the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Opening Commentary:There are massive spoilers ahead. If you don't want to be spoiled, take my advice and grab a copy of this book from your local library. That's where I got my copy, and I would be royally peeved if I'd spent money on it. That said, it's a decent read, which would probably be even more appealing if you're under 14 and don't know a darn thing about writing. Seriously, even amateur writers are turned into the most picky readers.Good:Details - The world, Alagaesia, is pretty well described.Realism - The characters feel pain and aren&iexcl;t impervious to the elements.Fair:Action - Most of the action was decent, even good. There was still the occasion when the action didn't seem to flow well at all.Bad:Characters - Brom, as the mentor guy, was the stereotypical mentor-guy to the Nth degree. Eragon learned to read in a week and learned to be 2nd best swordsman in Alagaesia w/in 6-8 months. Even for archetype hero that batters the suspension of disbelief.Cliches - farm boy --> hero; Brom = hero's mentor. Why doesn't anyone know who the heck their mother is?? (Speculation: it wouldn't surprise me if Eragon and Murtagh are brothers. We suspiciously are never told the name of Murtagh's mother, and she did disappear for awhile); Evil king; hordes of monsters; fair elves; Brom gone, Murtagh show's up.Plot - It's all been said before so I shall be brief here. Eragon is pretty much LOTR, Star Wars, Chronicles of Narnia, and several other fantasy/sci-fi stories thrown in a cauldron, viciously mixed about, and dumped out in a sticky heap. Beyond that, even though it was a journey it was so darn repetitive I was left dazed and struggling to plod through it all. Summary of massively long journey all over this world: leave home, obtain horse, ride, ride, ride, reach town and get in a fight, ride, ride, ride, ride, reach another town - best a bully ; walk into a standoff, get supplies, ride, ride, ride etc.Dialogue - Aside from the unnatural flow of modern day speak to medieval to made-up, the dialogue is unduly wordy. Even Brom the storyteller comes off as wordy. By the time I got to Murtagh's back story I couldn't help but count; in the hardback version, it spans pages 387-391! In all those pages, perhaps 1 paragraph is description; the rest is Murtagh telling his sob story.Grammar - I have three pages of notes on this. Most of them have to do with commas, which is no big deal. However, my major grammatical nit (and I'm not even sure it's 100% correct) is that more than one character is present in many paragraphs. For example, this is often what I see: one character speaks; the actions or reactions of another are described; the first character speaks again. I believe b/t lines of dialogue you need to stick with the same character. You can still describe the second character's actions/reactions, but it must be phrased so that the sentence is still in the point of view of your first character. (Sorry if I'm massively confusing anyone.)Closing Commentary:If you've made it this far, you've either read the book or don't mind spoilers. In the former case, you may agree or disagree as you will. In the latter case, I will only say: libraries are our friends."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Everyone else has said it already: Yes, Eragon copies off of other fantasies. Yes, the dialouge is bad and the plotline...plods. Yes, Christopher Paolini's biggest marketing tool is not how good his book is, but how he was \\"fifteen when he wrote it.\\"Now that I've cleared all that up, onto the review:I bought Eragon at the height of his popularity, interested because of how many of my friends had read it and liked it, and because of the young age of the author. I thought it was all right. It didn't hold my interest nearly as well as it could have if it had been better written, and even then it is much too basic. All the characters fall on either the \\"good side\\" or the \\"bad side\\". The good side is, of course, with Eragon. The bad side is anyone whose against him. There's no middle ground, which makes the poorest books.Another thing that Eragon lacks on is, not so much the development of the characters, but some consistency wtih their personalities. You could say that they don't really develop at all. Eragon and Brom and Saphira and all could really all be interchangable, if their actions weren't clarified by name.I don't plan on raving on about every little mistake that Paolini's made. No, I don't intend to give him a break because this is his first book. (That is one of the lamest excuses you could put out there). But I wouldn't advise anyone to buy Eragon, not because its that bad, but simply because it's not original. Why read it, when it isn't worth it?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While, yes, it is impressive that a seventeen year old wrote it, it's definitely not impressive in...any other way. He put some creative ideas into it, but a confusing and intricate language, seeming sometimes as if he had banged on a row of keys on the keyboard to make a word, proved one of my many problems with the book.He also put some new twists on a bunch of old fantasy cliches (or atleast tried to) and it didn't work. His names weren't very original (exhibit A, \\"Selena\\", as in the Hispanic singing star) and the infamous battle scene at the end with the \\"mystery\\" of how can our hero and his underdog friends win when things look so dismal for them? When they are fighting a losing battle? The Answer: the infamous loophole in the fantasy laws and magical realms etc. of Paolini's \\"created\\" world. That and his many, many, MANY exhausting details of EVERYTHING that Eragon does. i.e., clearing a circle for the fire, gathering dry sticks for the fire, making a pile of sticks for the pile, finding the two perfect stones to smack together to create a spark for the fire, and then staring into the fire and thinking about something that had happened five minutes ago because the color of the fire reminded him.All in all, it was an ok story for a book that was basically the outcome of other fantasies, and a bunch of fictional cliches, all thrown into a blender and changed around. Its something i did keep (that being an understatement; i keep all my books) and it gave me something to read on an otherwise deadly boring six hour car trip. other than that, when people ask how i liked Eragon, all i can say in response: Eh."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As other reviewers have alredy stated, Eragon Does draw too much from other much better works of fantasy. What I noticed the most though, was how much was taken from David Edding's \\"Belgariad\\". The stories are so alike. Eragon is a farm boy, just like Garion. Eragon is an orphan, just like Garion. Eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer, Just like garion. Eragon does magic in the same way Garion does, through \\"The will and the word\\".I could go on and on. I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven't read Edding's masterpiece. One of the only resons his book sold so well was because he was so young when he started writing it.Also, the dialogue is stupid, and it is obvious that he tries to make his writing sound impressive through flowery writing style."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon the book is a textbook example of a tragedy: the very thing that makes it great, the hype, is its downfall. On the back cover there is a New York Times quote that refers to the book as \\"An auhetntic work of great talent.\\" This book is neither authentic, nor of particularly great talent.Is Eragon an enjoyable book? Yes. I read it in about a week, and will admit I put off other things to finish it. That being said, it isn't nearly deserving of the praise it's received, and this has been the source of my frustration with it. Paolini's a decent writer FOR HIS AGE, but that doesn't make him a writer who was ready to be published. If Paolini's writing abilities where akin to his basketball skills, he would have gone on to play college ball; he wouldn't have graduated to the NBA. And these weaknesses really come through in the book. Ultimately, Eragon reads like 500 pages of well-composed Internet fan fiction.First, it's most predictable fault: it is, as so many before me have asserted, largely a story of Star Wars meets Pern set in Middle-Earth. This, of course, is the first classic pitfall of a young author. That being said, once you accept the paradigm, Paolini does a very good job of immersing you in this parroted world he has fashioned, and it's a fun world to be immersed in.Paolini makes some writing mistakes that just aren't acceptable, however. For example, in one rather drawn-out and pooly written scene, Eragon chastizes his friend Murtagh for slaying an enemy in lieu of showing mercy. Yet later in the book before a big battle, Paolini writes that Eragon was glad Murtagh was fighting beside him PRECISELY BECAUSE Murtagh is a merciless fighter! Either mercy is good, Chris, or it ain't; you have to pick one.In addition, he makes his main character both excessively powerful and at the same time excessively weak. Halfway through the book Eragon is declared to be the greatest swordfighter Brom (the Obi-wan character) has ever met. This sentiment is confirmed by later characters, including Murtagh, who apparently has been sword-training all his life. That's right; Eragon goes from being a farmboy to a blademaster in a mere 250 pages. Who woulda thunk it'd be so easy? At the same time, Eragon gets captured TWICE, and can't seem to take on a single opponent without fainting.Paolini's real weaknesses as a writer, however, emerge whenever he tries to achieve the so-called \\"lyrical beauty\\" he asserts to aspire. On his website Paolini states, \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" Tolkien was a professor at Oxford and Heaney won the Nobel prize. Home-schooled Christopher Paolini doesn't come close to reaching either, and he shouldn't even compare himself with them.For example, at one point he gives a description of the Sea, referring to it as as \\"emotion incarnate\\" and some such. This might have been a good passage, except it doesn't feel genuine. The passage doesn't read like Paolini truly BELIEVES the Sea is emotion incarnate; it reads like he flipped through Tolkien, read his descriptions of the Sea, and tried to imitate them. Ultimately, it makes for unconvincing writing.This problem similarly emerges whenever Paolini attempts to show Eragon's doubts. There are several passages throughout the book where Eragon wonders \\"what kind of god could allow such horrible things to happen,\\" etc. Theoretically, these scenes would help develop Eragon as a character and elevate his adventure from being merely a good story to a good book.However, these scenes involve only one or two sentences before Eragon gets on with his life in the next paragraph. For the reader to genuinely feel Eragon's confusion and frustration, more exploration and depth into that confusion is required. As it currently stands, the passages are too shallow to be believable. Paolini currently lacks the emotional depth as a writer, and perhaps even as a person (the pitfall of many young writers, who stereotypically \\"have nothing to say\\"), to really carry these scenes.All that being said, Eragon is a good read, and definitely worth the buy. Just go in expecting to be disappointed with Paolini as a writer at several points."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Really, I wanted to like it. That's why I kept reading. But ultimately, an editor needed to sit him down and tell him to take it down a notch. Or two. It was soooo overwritten and totally unoriginal.

By his own confession, Paolini was not trying to write a bestseller when he wrote Eragon. He was writing a story that he would enjoy reading. His main character, a teenage boy named Eragon, was meant to be an archetype character, your typical hero. Don't look too far into this story. Don't scrutinize it to the point of not even seeing what's before you. If you like a good story, with action, love, friendship, dragons, etc., then pick up a copy of Eragon, settle down in a comfy chair, and enjoy the adventure described in mature, vivid tones of color and life.I won't bore you with the details of the plot. You can read that in any basic description of the book.Another word of advice: if you saw the film, also titled Eragon, and were dissappointed, give the book a chance. I love the book, but was dissappointed with the film, which picks out those themes that so many have said are found in LOTR and Star Wars. So much of the story and characterization was lost in the film, as well as some of the action and intrigue. Take some time to get acquainted with the true characters of Paolini's book.

I was very happy not to have had to wait to jump right into Book Two to find out what was going to happen next. I wish I knew when Book Three was coming out because now I'm left hanging until it's published!This trilogy was written for youth, and is appropriate for that audience. Adults who choose to read the books need to do so with an open mind to that fact, and appreciate that these books were written by a teenager. I found both of the first two books in the trilogy to be a delightful deviation from my usual reading, and highly recommend them both.I do caution parents from letting children under the age of 12 read them, however because of the violence contained in them.

My main problems with this book are as follows:1) as everyone else has mentioned, the storyline was totally copied off of books that are waayy better than this.2) as everyone else has mentioned, the names were all copied off of names that came from books waayy better than this.3) the author's avoidance of the word \`said'. I can't recall reading the word \`said' in this whole book.4) the author's overuse of adverbs describing exactly how the people asked/said. For instance, \\"Why\\" inquired Eragon, quite curious. I was quite shocked to see, \\"\`Sorry,' apologized Brom\\" in the text.5) the ancient language was very hard to read. It was mostly several consonants jumbled together. For example, the word for fire was: brsingr. The Urgal language was scattered with language from Tolkien's Orkish language.6) the Orcs-I meant Urgals, are supposed to be these dangerous creatures. But we are only ever TOLD that. We are never SHOWN that. Very unlike Tolkien's perfectly sinister orcs.7) as one reviewer has mentioned, Eragon looks a bit like Paolini.

I think NOT!!8) Paolini learned all his battle tactics from watching the Lord of the Rings movies. \\"Oh, good.\\" You think. \\"The battle scene should be really great then.\\" But, no. It is just as awful as the rest of his book. It is all told from Eragon's point of view. And, in the midst of fighting these horribly dangerous Urgals, he has time to look around and see what all the main characters in the book are doing. But only after that does he turn around and kill a group of unsuspecting Urgals.9) Paolini describes a sword as being a 5 foot long one-handed sword that is quit heavy. It would be impossible for even the strongest guy to be able to wield a one-handed 5 foot long sword. Most swords aren't that long or that heavy. Even the great Claymores were only 4 feet long and weighed little more than 3 or 4 pounds.10) I hated the part in which Eragon has his fortune told. I tells way to much of what's going to happen in the next books. Namely, Eragon's brother is going to turn on him, Brom is going to die soon, Eragon is going to leave Alagaesia, there is going to be an \\"epic romance\\" in his future, etc, etc, etc. As soon as I heard it and read 3 or 4 more chapters, I figured there was going to be some love triangle.11) the way Brom talks about Eragon's mother makes me think that he himself is Eragon's father. It would be much more hilarious though, for Galbatorix/Darth Vader/Evil Emperor/Sauron to be his father. I can't wait to read \\"No, I am your father,\\" stated Galbatorix. \\"NOOOO!\\" yelled Eragon angrily. Enraged that Brom had never told him this.12) Eragon is always angry or sad or feeling sorry for himself for no apparent reason. It gets quite irritating.13) the authors over the top descriptions describing everything and everyone in the book except Eragon himself. He wasted a whole 2 pages describing a map of Middle Earth-oops, Alagaesia, that the readers could have seen by flipping back a few pages.This book wouldn't have gotten published if it hadn't been for the following reasons:1) his parent's were publishers. Obviously, they thought their son was a genius. They would of published anything he came up with.2) he met the Random House publisher on one of his book tours. She had read the book and loved it. They became friends and she promised to publish his book if he so wished.My point: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this book!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One day, I was innocently winding my way through the racks of books in Barnes & Noble when a certain book - rather, the book's jacket - caught my eye. I blinked and went forward, certain that it had to be joke. The words 'Eragon' were scrawled across the hefty blue book, and I motioned my friend over to look. We glanced at each other and cracked up laughing. What sort of poor imitation was this?Well, a few weeks later, at the very beginning of my Christmas vacation, I once more found myself at Barnes & Noble with a cappuchino and a bored expression. And, once more, my eyes found that book - Eragon. I blinked and picked it up. Certainly, although it had ripped off Lord of the Rings terribly, (I could tell that from merely looking at the map and the cover) it couldn't be that bad.Whoa. I was /wrong/.As I started reading, the book didn't capture my attention at all - not like His Dark Materials and the Daughter of the Forest had. I forced myself through the first hundred or so pages, telling myself that it had to get better. I find no reason to point out the way Paolini has stolen from Tolkien, McCaffrey, Eddings, and numerous others, mainly because they're pointed out in many reviews before mine. Read those reviews, and you'll see.I could guess perfectly what was going to happen before it did; and that's exactly what I did. The character's were unoriginal, cliche, and poorly drawn, and lacked depth. The storyline was stale and overused: almost everything rang of something McCaffery,Eddings, or Tolkien had created. The Spine, the dwarven city, the dragons... I was appalled. Certainly he could have attempted to put some originalty into his work!All he had to do to make Eragon decent was to put some twists on the much-used storyline; but he didn't even manage to do that. I am so amazed by the fact that something so unoriginal and mundane could even reach the bookshelves. Even the writing was poor; he tried far too hard to be elegant and grand, and it came off poorly. I ended up skipping to the back of the book after a while, growing too bored.The 'Elven beauty' in this book disgusted me. Is it too hard to ask for a heroine who isn't captured, tortured, and then saved by her prince charming? Of course, she couldn't /die/. Oh, no. That would mean Eragon's quest would be completely pointless! Or, god forbid, she couldn't escape herself, or not be *enchanted* by our benevolent fifteen year old hero. That's simply too much to ask.I could rant on, and on, and on. But I'm wasting time, and my very own breath. Take my advice - don't pick up Eragon. It's purely and utterly hype."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I understand that in all fantasy you will find similarities and ideas that have been used before - it's unavoidable, considering there are only a limited number of concepts available. Yet I was under the impression that to write an original, creative story, one must take these concepts and use them in a way that is original and creative.Apparently no one has, as yet, pointed this out to Christopher Paolini.Eragon is a cut and paste of many original, creative and for that matter, better written stories that I have read. Many other reviwers have pointed out the sources - Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Anne McCaffery's Pern, David Edding's Belgariad. I don't need to cite examples - there are too many anyway. Paolini seems to have played cut-and-stick and glued together bits and pieces of these stories together. He even stole the map from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series...any WoT fans out there? There are even islands in the same place where Windbiter's Finger is, and a string of mountains called 'The Spine'.I believe the word for this is plagarism.And yet this wouldn't be nearly so bad if the plot had been interesting, the characters had been engaging, and there'd been some kind of... point. The writing shows potential, but is stiff and awkward, and in dire need of revision (I'm not sure where the editor's were at this stage... perhaps off planning an over-hyped publicity campaign?). In a few years, with some growth, some development, a few writing courses, and the appearance of some voice, Paolini will write a book to which the word 'good; can be applied. Hopefully editors will step in and point out his mistakes. Hopefully by the time he is twenty-five and the novelty of a teen writer has worn off, he will be forced to actually revise.Until then, you're better off spending your money elsewhere.

After reading the majority of \\"Eragon\\" and several reviews, I learned how a young teenager could become a successful author. I will not add anything to the already long list of complaints regarding C. Paolini's work. Others, who have come before me, have said it all.I will say this: I do agree that J. R. R. Tolkien and others have laid some of the foundations for works of fantasy, and that it would be impossible to write anything fantasy-related without paying homage to them. However, when names from the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", recognizably altered, appear as the names of places, rivers, lakes, or anywhere else on a map in a book of the same genre... When I read about a young impatient hero and an old wise mentor... When that old mentor turns out to be a member of an ancient order of warriors... When the similarities between your work (C. Paolini) and others number more than ten and can be listed by a school teacher, then you should know you crossed the line!Writing a book between the ages of 15 and 19 after graduating from high school by means of home schooling, does not necessarily make you (C. Paolini) a great, or even a good, author. \\"Eragon\\" could have been a great fantasy book if you (C. Paolini) had only taken a little extra time to note the similarities between your work and the famous works of others. Doing so would have guaranteed you (C. Paolini) at least a more respectable book. You (C. Paolini) were a novice then, and you are a novice now. Read the works of the past and use them to enhance your own writing, your own ideas, your own story. Use them as inspiration. Use them as a starting point. Do not use them as filler in your (C. Paolini) book!People can be forgiving. I am not! Write well C. Paolini. Make the last book in your \\"Inheritance trilogy\\" truly something to behold. For I will take your story and make it my own!

Dragon Quill is one of these reviewers. Unlike what Dragon Quill said earlier, Eragon WAS meant to be a literary classic. After all, Paolini compares his book to actual literary classics on his website. To use DQ's car metaphor, Eragon was meant to tear up the road but barely made it out of the garage."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"All I can see in this book is a rip off of several fantasies that I can name off the top of my head. It's very predictable and that made it rather unenjoyable. If he maybe put a few more years into it, he could have written it better. Well, by the end of the book we don't have any clue what the main character's hair color is, yet we know the ground is glistening white with snow. Right? It has no sense of location or time and is very poorly woven."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This review is for all of those \\"five-stars\\" who believe The Inheritance Trilogy to be the next coming of Tolkien and for anyone who is considering purchasing \\"Eragon.\\" The young author, Christopher Paolini, makes the three most common and devastating mistakes of a young author (aside from pirating his plotline from popular films and books), which are:1. Creating an uninteresting protagonist2. Missing opportunities to build suspense3. Telling instead of showingI found myself well into the depths of \\"Eragon\\" still wondering why I should care about its protagonist. He is not especially ambitious, skillful, or possessed of any other trait that would cause me to take an interest in him. And he whines! Paolini, it seems, spent more time devising his plot than his main character, resulting in a flat persona that I wouldn't spend five minutes with in real life. What's more, Paolini's lack of interest in Eragon results in a lack of interest in WHAT HAPPENS to Eragon. If I don't care about the character, I certainly don't care what happens to him, thus alienating me from the plot.Where Paolini could have remedied this problem he truly misses the boat. In the first few chapters, Eragon gets himself into seemingly deep trouble but then is almost instantly saved from any inconvenience or discomfort. I want to see him struggle a bit. I want SUSPENSE, a reason to continue reading. When Eragon is confronted by the butcher, instead of having to deal with the obstacle, a friendly villager intervenes. When a baby dragon threatens to make itself known through various squeaks and bumps from within Eragon's room, there is no seeming risk that the dragon will be discovered. And when Eragon's closest relative, his cousin, must confess he is leaving the family to seek his fortune, it is received with a kind blessing rather than a suspenseful argument. All in all, such lack of suspense and tension results in a horribly boring read.In the first several chapters alone I counted three instances when Eragon exclaims \\"I wish...{something}.\\" Rather than show us through action what Eragon truly desires, Paolini takes the easy road out and writes a single, thoroughly unconvincing line of dialogue in which the character tells us what he wants. Again Paolini misses the opportunity to create an semblance of action or suspense in his work, again revealing just how little experience he has as an author.While these are devastating mistakes any author can make, there is usually a kind of \\"cushion\\" awaiting him in the form of a cunning editor. Yet Paolini seems to have missed this safeguard in spades, for \\"Eragon\\" contains countless opportunities for editorial improvement that even the most inexperienced beginner would recognize. I wonder if the publisher had anyone at all review the work before it went to print.It is true that Paolini is not the first author to make the mistakes listed above, and he will certainly not be the last. What is sad, however, is that such a bald-faced representation of other popular works can make it into a publisher's shop and ultimately on the bestseller list. \\"Eragon\\" smacks of Star Wars, the Anne McCaffrey books, and a bit of J.R.R. Tolkien at almost every turn, painting a mental picture of the young author sitting in front of his television every night, making notes on what he likes most about George Lucas' and Peter Jackson's films before heading to his laptop to \\"write.\\" It took J.R.R. Tolkien decades of study, intellectual conversation with his peers, and careful craftsmanship to produce the one book (ultimately broken into a trilogy, nearly against his will, by the publisher) that was the Lord of the Rings. Yet Paolini felt he could accomplish something similar in a couple of years. What he has accomplished is exactly what that level of effort deserves: a blatant example of the pitfalls of inexperienced authors."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is the best fantasy book I have ever read.

I was FALLING ASLEEP FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!That's really all I have to say about that.Your critic, HECK NO! I'M NOT A FAN!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first heard that the author of Eragon had begun the book when he was only fifteen years old, I was a trifle leery of the content. Would it be corny? Would it be juvenile? As it turned out, it was nothing of the kind.Eragon tells the story of a young man named--you guessed it, Eragon. He lives in a remote valley in the country of Alagaesia, and he knows little about what goes on in the world outside his village and the mountains on which he hunts for food to feed his family. When, however, a blue stone is transported to him by magic and he keeps it, intending to sell it, his life is changed forever.First, the blue stone turns out to be a dragon egg, and the dragon within it hatches. Eragon, concerned what the villagers might think of a dragon in their midst, hides it in the woods and feeds it. He cannot speak to it with his voice, but he can contact its mind with his own, and it turns out to be a very effective means of communication, since it works over fairly long distances.Then every thing starts going wrong when two terrible creatures called the Ra'zac come into the town, asking about the blue stone and its whereabouts. Eventually these creatures kill Eragon's uncle, who had adopted Eragon when his parents had died some time before. Bent on revenge, Eragon and his dragon set out, along with a mysterious storyteller named Brom, to avenge his uncle's death.On the way, however, Eragon learns some very interesting things about himself and the Empire under which he has lived.Paolini's plot line does, admittedly, mooch many ideas from fantasy writers who have created works before him, but it was very interesting, and certainly a page-turner. I liked it a lot, and I can't wait until the next book in the trilogy comes out.There are, however, some points about the book that I did not like. Paolini seems to insert descriptions of people and creatures at exactly the wrong moment to be artistically correct. For example, right at the beginning of the book, a creature called a Shade, which we have never heard about before, has been given orders to ambush a party of elves--and tacked onto the end of a paragraph is the fact that this Shade would have looked human except for his maroon hair and red eyes. And that's it. Paolini should have put this in a separate paragraph in a place that made sense, describing in some detail how this Shade appeared. He's a young writer, though, and this is his first book. Doubtless he will improve with time.Also, Paolini introduces some questions in this book--which are very good questions to ask and should be faced--but there is one problem. As far as I could tell, they aren't really answered. For example, when Eragon sees a group of people in a town who have been killed by the forces of evil, he wonders to himself why it is worth living if life can so easily be taken away. Well, there's a very good answer to that question: God gave us our lives, and we live them and view them as a gift from Him. I'm not even sure what Paolini's view on this question is, because he simply didn't seem to touch on it afterward. Maybe I'm making a judgement too early and it will be discussed in the other two books, but I'm just saying that so far it hasn't really been touched on very much.Over all, however, Paolini has made a very good show of himself, especially for a first novel written at such an early age. My advice to him: keep up the good work, and believe in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm a professor of literature and language. From all that I have read, even on the dust jacket of this first book in Paolini's series, nobody, including the author or the publsher, makes a secret of the fact that he was heavily influenced by Tolkien, Lucas, McCaffrey, and most likely other readers.In fact, good writers are always influenced to some degree by those whom they have read. That's usually how they end up becoming GOOD WRITERS.Now, take a look at this very sentence in the prologue. This is the first introduction we have to the writing style of Paolini:\\"Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world.\\"That is powerful. That has nothing to do with Tolkien or Lewis or anyone. That has to do with individual writing voice, and an extremely good one, at that.When you read this book, or re-read it - look at it with an eye of examining how the words are put together. It's masterful. I've seen numerous examples, published and unpublished, of authors old and young(er) who were quite obviously influenced by any number of writers. Unfortunately, those writers, and I use the term as a point of reference only, did not choose to, OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO, string together words in such a way that was masterful. Or, for that matter, in any way approaching logic or sense or really, just sort of thrown in together in a way that made me quickly get to my used bookstore to trade in the item as fast as I could get rid of it. I'm talking about published writers who couldn't string together simple sentences and throw in an adjective or two along the way, without getting twisted up and falling over their own ink. And I've seen experienced writers do that, too.Anybody can use their love of certain written works to come up with similar plot lines.Plagiarism, as I saw a couple of reviews in here glibly toss out (and I am certain that means that you, of course, never plagiarized any of your reports in high school or college, yes? of course it does :) - is when someone steals another's words and claims them as their own.Paolini doesn't do that. The dust jacket, all press that I've read about him and his book, the publishers, his parents - everything I've read that promotes his book acknowledges in a broad metaphorical flag-waving right up front, Hey, Paolini was influenced BY - and gives a short list. That's not plagiarism.Also, ideas are not copyrighted. Words are. Ideas are not. Gilgamesh had an epic journey of good and evil. It's been going on for thousands of years in the written world. If we are going to start pointing fingers at who copied whom, or who had the original idea, I'm afraid you're going to have to point a finger at Tolkien and Lewis and McCaffrey. No writer for centuries has been able to avoid being influenced, to some degree, by those who have gone before.It's why writing is considered to be immortal, in a sense. Your words live on.And the words - oh my, Paolini's words. Look at how they are put together. Look at the rich description. That's not plagiarized. That IS original. Look at how he puts together ideas and plots and describes emotions, characters, colors, scents, the change of seasons, the change of terrain - that is all original. The WAY in which he put together his words, is original to him. It's his personal writing voice. Everybody has a writing voice. Some voices ought to be quiet, frankly, because they are that bad. Some voices should be trumpeted.Paolini's should be trumpeted.Gosh, you picked up a book that clearly, upfronts notes that Paolini was influenced by Tolkien, then you sit there and smugly type \\"Hey, ooobbbbbviously he was influenced by Tolkien\\" - well, gosh. You're like, Einstein. Of course, that would mean you got the idea of being Einstein, from Einstein. :)Look at the words. Look at how they are put together. Look at how Paolini crafts - yes, he crafts, he's an artist in the most precise sense - the words.Can you do that?Because I'm not seeing it in the evidence of some of your reviews. Or perhaps it was an off-day.Look - really look - at how the words are put together. It is art. It is truly art."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an amazing book.

It doesn't have as much of a fan base as the Harry Potter serise and is still kind of in the background because Harry Potter is still front and center, but I thought this book, writing wise, was a really good find for everybody. You'll find Eragon just as interesting as most of the Harry Potter books.The story begins with an kid called Eragon who lives with his cusion Roran and uncle Garrow, because is mother died at child birth without reveiling who his father was. His life is a humble one. He can't read of write much, doesn't really know whats going on outside his little town, and does nothing much else but hunt and farm for his family.One day his hunt is disturbed by a spontaninous explosion that leaves behind a beauiful blue egg. When the egg hatches, Eragon gets more than he bargined for when egg hatches and he finds himself mentally linked to a feircely intllegent baby dragon. Eragon has heard stories of dragons from Brom the storyteller, it is said that they where all killed by their tyrant of a king with the exception of three eggs and the king's own dragon. Brom discovers Eragon's situation and informs Eragon that because of his dragon the destiny of the entire world is about to change...Sounds simple enough right?

But what I do not understand how people can say, \\"The book Eragon should not elves in it, Lord of the Rings had elves in it.\\" I have read plenty of books with elves in it, similar to the way both Paolini and Tolkein described them. Here's another one: \\"No! Paolini should not have made the boy Eragon be able to telepathically talk to his dragon, it has already been done!\\" Honestly, it would have been quite cheesy if Saphira had actually talked. How about this: \\"Eragons teacher shouldn't have died, that already happened in Star Wars!\\" Well, you know what? It sounds really stupid when people say, \\"That specific character can't die, he has a slight similarity with a character in a different book!\\" I have finally concluded after reading many reviews on this website about Eragon, that these people are somehow jealous. I don't know why, but I think it is true. If not jealously, they are trying to defend their favorite title.

I like the character development, Saphira the dragon is wonderfully enigmatic. The growing relationship between Eragon and Saphira is well done. There is alot of foreshadowing of what is to come in the next books, and it is done in a way that will allow young readers to wonder what is coming, know that something is coming, but not be too sure about what it will be.My sons (age 8 and 10) and I have listened to the book on tape three times so far on car trips, and we are now fighting over who's turn it is to read the book itself. The tape is well done, I really like the voice of the reader.I have read some of the other reviews that criticize the book for being trite or a bad copy of someone else's ideas. This may be true for adults reading this book, but it is a book written for young people, and as such is a good introduction to fantasy literature. Perhaps it is true that Tolkien \\"purists\\" will be disappointed in this book (it wasn't written for them), but as someone who read Tolkien and loved it in high school, I see this book as a stepping stone for my boys, who aren't really ready for LOTR yet, but after reading this will be closer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read all the reviews about how this 15 year old wrote this \\"masterful\\" treatment, and how it was reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, etc. Now that I've read it, I'm sorely disappointed in others.

But, though coming late to the party, I would like to throw in my two cents and say that I enjoyed \\"Eragon\\", and even found it an astonishing accomplishment of fantasy fiction where the author's age is concerned. That does not mean I have no reservations about it, however. Beyond doubt, the story arc and characters involved are derivative, and Paolini takes few brave steps out of the Hero's Journey archetypes his book is infused with. When the Inheritance Cycle has concluded, I would love to see him return to Alagaesia, but with characters and a plot of his own creation, with more room for his own original twists.That being said, the novel itself is rather well-built. The characters are developed adequately for the reader to sympathize with them, and Paolini's settings are often captivating. His description of the dwarf kingdom, inside the crater of an immense volcano, is truly a wonder to read, and you find yourself blissfully wishing the place existed.There is also a fascinating bit of originality in Eragon and his mentor Brom deciding to track the monsters who killed Eragon's uncle with shipping records. If Paolini was the hack writer many people (sadly) accuse him of being, he would most likely have settled for the standard way of following bad guys: \\"Follow the footprints, and the bodies they leave in their wake.\\" But Paolini, at least in this regard, makes his work and characters much more intelligent than that.It is certainly not without its flaws, but as time went on, and I kept reading the Inheritance Cycle, I found Paolini's world and characters growing on me. It's a shame \\"Eldest\\" and \\"Brisingr\\" made more bad decisions than good, but I still look forward to the final installment, because \\"Eragon\\" at least got me to care. If you still haven't made a decision on this book, go ahead and pick up a copy. Maybe it will grow on you, too."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Personally, I wasn't very impressed. It is a decent adventure story, but it's very predictable and pretty cliche throughout. I will wait and see how the story develops- because it did keep me entertained. I mean, it's not the most original story, but it's a decent eight-hour ride book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Novice readers of fantasy love this book. To anyone who has read a lot of fantasy, including young adult fantasy, it is instantly forgetable.Young people should be directed to role models like Christopher Paolini or S. E. Hinton of authors who were published when they were still teenagers, but if you are looking for a better young fantasy writer, introduce them to Amelia Atwater-Rhodes instead. She signed her first publishing contract when she was just 13, I think.Dragon lovers love dragons no matter what and any young fantasy reader who is not already deeply steeped in Tolkien, Feist or McCaffrey will probably love this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini obviously had no idea what he was doing when he wrote this book. All of his characters were simply copied from real masterpieces. Like The Lord of the Rings. I know not everyone can be as great as Tolkein, but if you're going to duplicate his work please try to at least put some of your own passion into the story. Real artists have their own way of thinking. Rowling,lewis,and Tolkein were the first authors of their kind and we should praise them not amatuers like Paolini. Thank You MaryAnn from Texas."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm still reading this book and am almost done, but I will be direct about it: it seems as though nothing is truly bad about the story. I like the way things are rolling along with the plot. Saphira is an interesting dragon (not as cool as some dragons) with a very charming personality. I also like the use of a certain language they use in this book. It adds creativity if anything to the world Paolini was going for. Each character is interesting enough not to lose face with the reader, including Brom and Orik.However, there is one character who I'm greatly disliking: Eragon. He is slowly becoming more and more annoying with each page. He has the ability to use magic and wields weapons well, but I feel this is blowing his character out of proportion. Making the protagonist this powerful makes him unattractive in the following pages: VERY. Believe it or not, Eragon is actually becoming arrogant and going on an ego trip because of his abilities and it's started to get on my nerves. His questions to others are impolite and inconsiderate at all (doesn't respect the fact people may not want to talk). All I can ask Paolini is what were you thinking when you thought up this punk for the story's hero. I liked him better when he was just a naive farm boy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is good for a fifteen year old. Really. It's pretty amazing that a kid who's only fifteen can write such a long book and publish it.My emphasis being on LONG.Eragon has a major case of HPLS. Harry Potter Length Syndrome. Much like the fifth Harry Potter book that drags on forever, Eragon does too. Except in Eragon, the length isn't even advancing the plot, it's basically just proving that Christopher Paolini can write a long book.The problem is, he can't write a GOOD book. There is the occaisonal chapter in Eragon that is well written, but most are full of cliches and \\"big\\" words.I have nothing against big words, and I'm not one of those people who hates anyone smart, but Paolini doesn't even seem to KNOW what his big words mean. Often he just seems to throw them in, like \\"this long and complicated word will make my book look more 'adult', so I'll put it in for the heck of it\\".If you are thinking \\"cliches\\" just means something a little over-used, let me correct you. Eragon is filled with the kind of cliches that make you cringe. For example, a salutation in the book is \\"May your swords stay sharp\\". I was reading along, thinking Eragon could make a pretty decent movie, but when I read that line, I changed my mind. MAY YOUR SWORDS STAY SHARP??? *Cringe*Now to the plot. The plot is all right, except it reads like every other fantasy I have ever read. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, but Eragon certainly isn't \\"fresh\\" or \\"new\\". Basically the book has a plot for a first grader, and words that only an English proffessor would know.Still, it IS true that publishing a book at all at the age of fifteen (even if your parents help out) is pretty impressive. The book Eragon is no worse than cheap drugstore fantasy novels. But I think the annoying part is, Paolini got extremely rich on something that reads a bit like a good drugstore novel, when it's supposed to be \\"excellent fiction\\". Eragon is NOT excellent fiction. Between the cliches, the \\"impressive\\" (or annoying) vocabulary, and the weak plot, Eragon is a so-so book.This is the kind of book that a fifth-grader might enjoy if they don't mind using a dictionary every few seconds. There really is no \\"ideal\\" age group for this book, because (as I've said many times) it's not a great book.Maybe Eldest will be better. Maybe not. But either way, I suggest not buying it. Give Paolini a few years, then see if he's worth reading. Right now he's not really, unless you are an immature reader with a huge vocabulary that likes cliches. If you are, read on, for Eragon is the book for you!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First of all, I work with kids. (I'm a librarian.) And kids can be very picky. If they like a book, then they like the book, and if they don't like it, they REALLY don't like it. There is not often a gray area with them.I've had discussions with kids who love \\"Eragon\\" and I've talked to kids who didn't like it. More often than not, the ones who hated it, could tell me clearly why they didn't like it, while the ones who did like it, couldn't say much more than, \\"It was so cool!\\" Or \\"I really liked the adventure!\\" I'm not sure why this is, but there you go.Personally, I hated the book. But I tend to keep my opinions to myself when it comes to talking to the kids-- unless of course they ask me. I thought the book was poorly written and derivative. I don't need to say why, because if you look at the \\"1-star\\" reviews, you can find many who have given fine and detailed examples.But what makes me angrier than the fact that this book was published, is hearing the old excuse, \\"but it's a kid's book.\\" To quote the wonderful author Jennifer Donnelly, who wrote on her website in April 2005, \\"The idea that books for and about children can only be of interest to children is absurd. And not only is it absurd, it's offensive. It's like telling a reader not to bother reading \\"Beloved\\" unless she's black or \\"Dubliners\\" unless he's Irish. Books are not gated communities, they are open cities where we can all come and go at will, freely sampling other lives and times, other cultures and realities.\\" (I sincerely apologize for any copyright infringement I may have breached by posting that. She just said it so much better than I could.)So to Robert Gagnon: how dare you relegate this book to the children's section and so imply that it's awfulness is ok! In doing that, you tell kids that their literature doesn't need to be well-written and original,and that it's ok for writers to plagiarize and push poorly-written books on them. A book is a book no matter who it's intended audience is. And no book should be judged by the age of the author or the area of the bookstore it happens to be in. If it's a bad book, it's a bad book, period. NEVER tell kids that they shouldn't expect good books. They should demand and expect them, same as adults.And two big FYIs: children still like \\"Star Wars.\\" In fact, I've had many, many kids request \\"Star Wars\\" books in the past couple months, mostly due to the recent release of \\"Revenge of the Sith.\\" But \\"Star Wars\\" has been popular for over 20 years and will continue to be so, long after this last movie comes out on DVD. Also, the comparisons were warranted and truthful, even if they didn't matter to you. Secondly, \\"Eragon\\" does not \\"seem\\" to borrow from other sources: it does, period. Whether or not that bothers you is up to you. As for me, I like my literature to at least attempt to be original. We can have \\"borrowing\\" as long as the borrower does something original and adds something new to the world. Paolini did not do that.I hope your kids seek other, better Fantasy books. They deserve them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Being a reader of both Tolkien and Rowling, I had the misfortune of receiving this book twice from well-intentioned friends, who thought I would enjoy it since it seemed to fit the same genre. And in a sense, they were right: after all, Paolini liberally steals from a host of fantasy novels to fashion this painful-to-read slapdash construction.Knowing nothing of the history of the book, I dived into my first copy and hit the bottom within the first chapter. Dumbstruck, I put the book down, wondering why anyone would have agreed to publish this dreck, which seemed to be the transcription of a rather boring gaming session with a lackluster dungeonmaster.Since my friends had recommended Eragon so highly, I figured that maybe I was out-of-tune, so I sallied into the following chapter, only to discover that it didn't improve. Then on a whim, I jumped ahead hoping to catch some spark from the end of the story to make me want to read all the exposition in-between.However, rather than hitting the end of the story, I stumbled into the glossary section. \\"Derivative\\" is too kind a word to describe Paolini's languages; instead, the word that best befits his made-up tongues (and for that matter, the rest of his writing) is \\"plagiarized\\". When Tolkien constructed his artificial languages for the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion, etc., he constructed full languages with rules of syntax, phonology, assonance, and so forth. Paolini knows nothing of these - and so his crude imitation is a desecration of the original: ugly, misshapen, and offensive.In the end, I could bear no more. I placed both copies for sale on Amazon, sending one to a child in Alaska and the other to a reader in Portland. As for the child in Alaska, I suspect this will have been a welcome gift. To the reader in Portland, I am sorry.In retrospect, Eragon is nothing more than the work of a zealously overpromoted teenager and not a budding literary genius. The strength of this gimmick and the average American's poor familiarity with real literature are what continue to sustain this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Before I begin...to all those reviewers who are snapping at others for giving this five stars, everyone's entitled to their opinion, and if they think it merits five stars, that's up to them.I don't think \\"Eragon\\" merits five stars. In fact I don't think it merits ONE star. For the following reasons...1) The entire book is a blatant rip-off. The plot is ripped from the first Star Wars film and set in a Middle Earth style realm. Many names have also clearly been stolen from the Lord of the Rings books. Before reading this book I had thought that \\"Shadowmancer\\" was the biggest rip-off I had ever read. But at least that book had some original ideas, and the author did try to hide anything he'd ripped off. Christopher Paolini hasn't put a single idea into this book, and hasn't made so much as a token attempt to hide the bits he's stolen.2) Paolini is clearly one of those grade school students whose English teachers have convinced him that the use of the word \\"said\\" is a criminal offence in the world of writing. In this book there isn't a single use of the word \\"said\\"...Paolini uses every alternate word he can come up with, and when he can't come up with one he says \\"stated.\\" In some places this isn't too bad, but in others it's plain unnecessary (such as in the infamous line \\"'I'm sorry,' apologised Brom\\").3) A lot of the words Paolini uses are out of place. It gives the impression that he had a thesaurus next to him while he was writing this book and he used the fanciest words he could without bothering to check their proper meaning.4) The description is very here and there. Paolini doesn't even bother to describe Eragon's appearance to us, but he gives us so much unnecessary description that it makes the book slow and plodding. He also tacks unnecessary adverbs at the end of nearly every line a character speaks.5) Eragon has got to be one of the most unlikeable heroes in literary history. He seems to be incapable of doing anything wrong, and can master any ability in a few months (making me wonder if Paolini based Eragon on the person he thinks he himself is). He's also grumpy, arrogant and stuck-up, and is totally ungrateful for the help of his friends.6) Half the chapters end with Eragon getting knocked unconscious or falling asleep.7) Paolini clearly doesn't know a thing about sword-fighting. You can't become an expert at it in a few months, and as another reviewer pointed out, you can't combine different sword moves.8) The characters are bland and one-dimensional. You don't care what happens to the heroes, and you don't feel angry towards the villains.9) The ending is awful.I've read a synopsis for this book's sequel, \\"Eldest,\\" and it looks set to be a clear rip-off of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (and there are various hints in this book that Galbatorix will turn out to be Eragon's father).As I said in my review for \\"Shadowmancer,\\" you can tell if a book is going to be bad when the author becomes proud and pompous about it. On Paolini's website he calls his book \\"a lyrical beauty\\" on the same level as Tolkien. I should have steered clear of this book when I read that, but I gave it a chance anyway, and it let me down. It still hasn't displaced \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\" as the worst book I've ever read, though.One final note...to all those who are saying it's remarkable that Paolini got this published at such a young age, the reason for that is because his parents own a publishing house, and as they think anything he writes is flawless they would publish this without a question. If only they hadn't...Also, just because Paolini is fifteen doesn't make this a good book by any means."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Please. Have any of these reviewers who gave this book 5 stars ever heard of Michael Moorcock? How about Ursula K. LeGuin? This guy named J.R.R. Tolkien? Hmmm? I believe someone did some movies out of his books a short while back....WAKE UP FOLKS!!! This book is basically a rehash of Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, etc., etc. There is not a drop of originality between these pages (WHAT!! He's a DRAGONRIDER!!! That's ASTONISHING!!! I've never heard of such a thing...oh...wait...except for those \\"Pern\\" books...) Get a clue. There is much better fantasy literature out there. You just have to go out and find it. Kudos to this kid for getting published at such an early age. This book is no worse than most of the schlock that passes as fantasy these days, and it's better than some, but you live a pretty sheltered life if you think this is a 5 star fantasy novel. Try to widen your horizons a bit folks. Not every good fantasy novel starts with a poor farm boy who is an unknowing wizard/savior/prince/warrior-king/(supply your own cookie-cutter stereotype here), who's parents die/go missing/are murdered and leaves to discover his \\"true self\\" (and save the world along the way) in the company of some old monk/wizard/seer/eccentric old teacher.

Tolkien's plot without Tolkien's wisdom is kind of sad. McCaffrey's dragons without originality is sad, too. Jordan's mountains and creatures without Jordan's great writing is really sad.

It can't be as bad as it seems.\\" I even went back and re-read the several chapters, thinking I'd somehow missed some spark of brilliance.Fat chance. It's not there.There isn't an original idea, a novel concept, a well-conceived plot line, or a nicely drawn character in the entire book. Lots of other reviewers have cited the author's various sources. I encourage you to read something from one of the authors Paolini ripped off and skip this miserable piece of fan fiction."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Oh, how disappointed I was of this book. Curious because of - yes - the author's age, I bought this book on a whim (should have gotten the Pullman instead!) and found precisely what I would expect a self-important adolescent to write. How else can I describe this book than a conglomerate of other (and more competent) authors' ideas? Any Tolkein, Jordan, McCaffery, or Weis and Hickman, anyone? Paolini's boring, stuffy elves even came to his brain-child of a continent from across the sea on a ship. From an unknown land. Imagine that.Paolini's narrative lacks depth, not to mention any kind of originality. Within the first 100 pages the plot stalls out and goes... where? An over-reliance on deus ex machina renders the story entirely unbelievable, as well as establishes a lack of credibility for the author. The characters are nothing more than regurgitations of the same old tired cliches. Eragon is utterly deplorable; nothing more than a fool. That he is also an obvious personal fantasy of the author is embarassing. And we are actually expected to care about his oh-so-honorable quest of revenge? Even the dragon disappoints (hmmmm, a female creature that always listens to her, um, man and does whatever he says even when it is idiotic? Made me want to puke.) That our children are being led to think this author represents quality fantasy makes we want to run screaming to the local school district for a lesson on bad writing, and the sheer delight of Rebecca Rupp.The interesting thing is that, were this story written 10 years ago before the Harry Potter and LOTR pop-culture crazes (and I wonder how many LOTR fans have actually read the series,) Paolini's manuscript would never have earned the attention of a competent editor. The manuscript would have been returned to Paolini with well-needed advice to take a few basic writing courses. As well as to learn a little more about real life before trying to replicate it. Of course, it helps to have parents in the publishing business, able to print their son's genius without regard to word count. When I feel a need to read a book with a red pen in hand, in the garbage it goes. And to think of all the truly young talents that never have the opportunity to publish on account of a simple lack of connections makes me want to weep.Shame on the American public for having such poor taste in (fantasy) literature. Shame on Paolini's parents for failing to exercise self-restraint and good judgment and curb their son's ambitions (not to mention their own) before they went too far. And shame on Paolini for letting his ego overtake all else. This book is nothing more than modern hack writing at its worst."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There aren't enough words to express how miserable Christopher Paolini's novel is. There aren't enough synonyms for \\"bad\\" to more easily translate to you, visitors of Amazon, the awful writing, plotting, characterization, prose, thematic and stylistic concerns of this book. In fact, there aren't enough enough ways to show the overall immaturity of the book's fans who cannot stand to have their Bible marked as anything less than incredible and awe-inspiring literature.I won't even try.I urge you, turn somewhere else for a decent read. You won't find it here."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book starts off with a fantastic prologue. It was a joy to read it. Then, it goes on to Chapter 1. And then Chapter 2, and 3, and 4, and a thought comes to your mind... \\"Haven't I read this 100 times before?\\" And you have.Eragon is riddled with unoriginality, with a hint of incompetence here and there. Stolen from such popular series as Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings, and so much more, the plot and characters are nothing new. But one thing is however, the boring, sloppy style of writing.It is painful to read this thing. It took me five different attempts to get past Chapter 6. And when I finally did, I was sorry.Of course, the Book attempts to get even more popularity by explaining that it was written by a 15 year old. Actually, that's not too hard to figure out. The only reason it was published is because his parents have a publishing company. Anybody else would've used the manuscripts for firewood, or something useful like that.So in conclusion, Eragon is a waste of time, money, and page turning. Your fingers could be doing so much more.

It's not bad as such, it just keeps reminding you how much better it's been done elsewhere. The story is totally derivative. I accept that it's difficult not to be these days, but sadly there's not an ounce of originality and far too much direct copying. Even then, if the story was a page-turner, you might be OK but it drags most of the time. Goodness only knows how the author is going to keep it going for two more books.

I knew going into it the basic story and that it was written by a teenager. Therefore, I expected many of the things those giving it low ratings criticized.Yes, it was similar to other fantasy stories. However, a large number of fantasy stories borrow from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" in describing different races such as elves and dwarves. I was not surprised that Paolini made the choice to use these established traits for his characters.The plot was formulaic: a boy who never knew his parents is living in a small village with his uncle. He finds a dragon egg, a rarity in his time ever since a dragon rider crowned himself king and destroyed or hid all of the remaining eggs. Eragon, the boy, is chosen by the dragon in the egg to be its rider. Alternately pursuing and pursued by the king's soldiers, Eragon is able to train with a mysterious man from town who seems to know far more about dragon riders than he claims.It was occasionally exasperating when the plot took a particularly predictable turn, as when a fortune teller predicted a death (did anyone except Eragon really not know who was going to die?). However, the book was entertaining overall and will probably translate well into an exciting movie."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have to agree with many other reviewers that this book lacks a certain maturity of composition. It is well written and tells a great (if cliche) story, but through the, at times gaping, seams one can see the light of other works like Dragonlance, Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and other excellent fantasy novels. At times, the similarities are so thinly veiled that I physically winced and felt slightly embarrassed for having seen through.All in all, this book is an interesting read because it does bring a few new concepts to the fantasy table and Mr. Paolini manages to rework a few old ones in his young style. Those are the bits that kept me reading through to the end and keep me hopeful that this talented young writer's style and voice will mature and he will hire a FAR BETTER editor.It is worth purchasing for a light read, but no new ground is broken in a meaningful way."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love this book!

This novel was a well-crafted, well-planned, and well-written story. It was an adventure just to read it. While reading, because of Paolini's vivid imagery, I felt like I was there. When I sat down with this book, I was on a dragon's back sword fighting with monsters and wielding magic, I was on horseback riding across a desert in company of friends, I was the one living the adventure. Paolini's vivid description of characters added to this illusion. Murtagh and I would sword fight around a campfire at night until we were so tired we collapsed laughing. Brom was teaching me the secrets of magic and showing me how to control my dragon in flight. I was the one who was communicating with Saphira and growing to love her. This huge weight that had been put on Eragon's shoulders and all of the things that came with it didn't belong to him. When I was reading, they belonged to me. That is why I love reading so much.

I also think Paolini crammed too many events into one book, so, since I'm an extremly fast reader, the conflicts sort of just jumped out at me and sank back into the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What makes a good book? Well, for one thing, most avid readers will say that they want well-developed characters, a key ingredient to a literary masterpiece. Paolini achieves this through weaving a tapestry of personalities, including the courageous Eragon, the talkative Saphira, and a mysterious ally I won't mention the name of (no spoilers here, folks). Another factor towards a good book is action. People would not like to sit down with a 900 page book and fall asleep during the first 50 pages. Eragon keeps you glued to your seat. Even if a chapter is a relaxing vacation from the usually gripping violence and drama, there is enough satisfying dialogue to keep you interested. Now, people may say that Christopher Paolini has borrowed ideas from celebrated authors, but you must accredit him for achieving an enriching story with original characters, a diverse language, and remarkable and eloquent speech. You might be wondering why I have hardly touched down on the wondrous plot, but the purpose of a book review is to look at the overall standpoint of the book. Kudos to Mr. Paolini."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini put together a story of magic, dragons and battles.

I read this book in less than a week, and am anxiously awaiting the next one in the series. ... this is a great book. Well written, and fast!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is fantasy all the way! \\"Eragon\\" is an amazing book! Every chapter got more and more exciting. It never let go of my attention. I felt like I was there, watching the whole thing through my eyes. This book is truly magical. I got so attached to all of the interesting characters. When I put the book down I felt like I missed, like they were real. I love everything about this book. My cousin recommended \\"Eragon\\" to me and I recommend it to you!A boy named Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest. He desides to bring the stone back home, he thinks it will buy meat for the family. Little does he know that the blue stone is really a dragon egg! Eragon now understands he isn't an ordinary farm boy anymore. Just over night his once simple life evolves into a magical journey with magic. Eragon only has the advice of a storyteller, and now a dragon hatchling, and now they must find their way in a magical world of surprises, magic, and new enemies. Will Eragon be able to make it through this strange world of magic with his new companion? The strange road that lies ahead will be his destiny.I would recommend this book to grades seven and up. Because in the beginning the book goes slow, and it is a little confusing. But once you work your way into the book you'll love it. And if you like fantasy this whole book revolves around fantasy. I like fantasy, and this is one of my favorite books. A great book by Christopher Paolini.Can't wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My friend let me borrow the book \\"Eragon\\" not too long ago, and I finally started reading it. I must say, if you like fantasy, you will definately like this book. And the first thing you will notice is that it has every aspect you can think of, or at least recognize, from other fantasy and sci-fi novels - common ones in fact. This leaves the story dry at times, as Paolini tries to rush into things, especially at the beginning. It seems when you read the first few chapters, you've already read half the book. But his writing is wonderful for someone so young to be published, I must give him credit on that.But things that caught my eye is the way he practically excerpts other fantasy books, most of which you may have read already. Reading about trolls, dwarves, and elves and the \\"Ancient Language\\" was practically cut from Lord of the Rings, and even by just watching the movie, everything that relates is clearly evident. Also, I am a huge Anne McCaffrey fan of her Dragonriders novels, and I felt a bit strange to see it \\"ripped off\\" so to speak...He speaks of \\"Dragon Riders\\", as of course the main character (Eragon), goes through the similar process of obtaining a dragon as \\"Dragonriders of Pern\\" novels write, and McCaffrey's books are practically a legacy. Simply, Eragon finds a \\"rock\\" (it's really a dragon egg) that hatches into a dragon and connects \\"mentally\\" with his mind, ect. Brom even explains the dragon chooses the person, and all of that seems directly taken from the Pern novels. A bit different, all in the end.As good as a writer he is at his age, there are still things that he needs to work on. I'm not a genuis writer myself, but you will find yourself baffling at times when a random comment/explanation comes up in the middle of an unrelated conversation, which leads to more and more unrelated ideas. It seems Paolini put more \\"information\\" into his characters rather than personality, which leaves it bluntly, DRY. You will quickly get over his \\"saids\\" and \\"dids\\" at first, and become used to the over-under descriptiveness, or the more/less detail needed for a certain situation. But the book is great, and will keep you reading for a while (as thick as it is).Final conclusion - not for hardcore fantasy readers. I'm not even a hardcore fantasy reader, and I still feel like I'm reading 10 books at once, all ideas taken from other books (Tolkien, McCaffrey, ect). It's not necessarily a \\"fresh\\" new fantasy world with beliefs, ect, but certainly enjoyable to most."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I must admit, when I first heard about Eragon and its plot, I was a bit skeptical. However, once several acquaintances had urged me to read it, I consented to give it a try. And I was pleasantly surprised. I simply could not put it down.As I have read in several reviews on various Internet websites, whether they are casual or more official, this novel does reflect in many aspects the work of other authors such as Tolkien, McCaffrey, and many more famous names throughout the fantasy realm. However, I find this book to have a different flavor, both complimenting and contrasting the more prestigious writers. Perhaps it is because this plot was conceived and written through the mind of a young adult, but I find that the characters and movements in the storyline are seen in a completely different light than in the vision of more accomplished writers.The style of writing may, at some times, seem common and unsophisticated, almost unworthy, but who among the myriads of amateur writers has no such work? I must confess to being among the many who falter in their practice in the creation of conceivable storylines and characters. I believe that this style, just now emerging, is that of the new generation of writers to come. In reflection, it may be seen as a comparison to the world around us. Although not perfect, as it may seem in comparison to other items, I find Eragon to be an enrapturing tale of the trials and conquests of an unwilling hero trying to fit in."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is a fresh perspective on fantasy. A teen-aged boy finds a dragon, Saphira, and sets out to avenge the death of his uncle, battling the forces of darkness along the way. The best part -- this book was written by a boy who is about the same age as the hero, Eragon. The result is authentic storytelling.Eragon, the main character, grows from a naive hunter to a budding Dragon Rider with the powers of magic. Knowing that Paolini started the book at the age of 15 gives credence to his view of the loss of a relative, young love and crushes, oppression of well-meaning teachers, and the looming dark forces of evil kings and wicked sorcerers. The result is striking. This book gives readers a peek at how teenagers feel about the world around them, which older and more powerful people control, not unlike the perspective of most teenagers.Other reviews that pooh-pooh Eragon should cool their heels, get over their jealousy and realize that this book is fresh and entertaining. Some have said that Paolini has 'ripped off' other fantasy writers. They have somehow forgotten that the genre of fantasy -- the world of elves, dwarves, dragons, and wizards -- has been well developed by previous writers, most notably Tolkien. Those who pick up the torch of fantasy story-telling need not recreate that world, which makes it the perfect playground for young writers such as Paolini because they need not remake what has already been mapped out. The same is true of writing about the mafia in New York City, for example. The skyscrapers, taxicabs, and gun-wielding thugs in dark coats need not be recreated. Paolini chose a perfect subject to launch his writing career on because he can legitimately rely on those masters who have already created the fantasy realm.Finally, the critics of Paolini betray their jealousy too easily. Anyone who has written a novel or short story and has tried to sell it knows that there is a sea of self-involved souls who view other writers as competition and take every opportunity to tear down others on the way to success. They cloak themselves in the skin of creative criticism but they possessed by the spirit of If-I-Can't-Publish-Neither-Can-You. Do not listen to those that attack Paolini because of his age. They are merely frustrated after years of trying to publish their own boring works, and now are enraged that someone so young could find success so early. Well, more power to Paolini. He has given us an entertaining read and a new look at fantasy from a fresh perspective."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you call this epic, think again. All \\"Eragon\\"(Lord of the Rings imitation of Aragorn)and \\"Brom\\" do is travel through trees and mountains. Epic journey? Nope. Just because the author is 19 or whatever, it's not the best book. My friends hated it, they claim it's an imitation of Lord of the Rings, examples;Elves, Dwarves, wizards, and dragons! THIS IS NOT A CONSCIEDENCE. Elves are spelled exactly the same, as are Dwarves, and their culture is the same too! Dwarves are great miners and craftsmen,they carry axes and chain mail, they're short, stocky, and strong, Elves are beautiful and good at forging swords, and they even have a horse lord, like Shadowfax!! The elf, Arya, is like Arwen, with long dark hair, and yet, Murtagh is like Boromir, with a silver bound horn!!!!!!!! This book is NOT epic, I'm telling you! It's a copycat!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have 3 reasons to hate this book. The author's age is not one of them. Age has nothing to do with quality of work- for good stories by young authors, at least the first two Valdemar anthologies (Sword of Ice, Sun in Glory, ed. Mercedes Lackey) have good stories by a girl who is twelve or so. She is a better writer than Paolini- not stellar, but not as bad as Eragon and Eldest.1. His writing style is stilted, jerky, and has no flow. There is a flowing, musical, poetic feeling to the work of really good writers- Tolkein, Le Guin, McKillip have this. Other writers, like Lackey, create a less-poetic but real, beleivable world. Not Paolini. I am really sorry to give such a negative review of a first book, but htis needed more work.2. From Murtagh's story to Eragon and the prophesy (Prophesies are an excuse for laziness- they tell the characters what is going to happen. They are also truly annoying unless handled REALLY well. I figured out that Murtagh was the one who was going to betray Eragon, and I nearly got rid of the book then. (At least I had the sense to get it from the library.)3. Eragon makes way to big a deal about that scar. He is NOT crippled, and he is an irritating character. He acts like it is the end of the world.If you want to read this book, do it, but get it from the library. If you end up thinking that my review is trash, and you like the story, then you can get hte book after all. It's not like it's in short supply in either bookstores or libraries."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, how should I say this? It reads like a book written by a 16 year old. There was much hype when this was published and I only read this book very recently. I completely agree with the previous reviewer. Nothing original, no character development, not much of a story. It is mind boggling how this book became #1 Bestseller. Good marketing, I guess. It is basically Star Wars during the time of the Lord of the Rings. Magic instead of the Force and Brom for Obi-Wan. Throw in the dragon-rider mindlink by McCaffery, you have Eragorn."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To write a book can be very hard. Publishing one can be even harder. Getting it to sell is no easier....So kudos to Chris Paolini for managing to do that. He must have put a great deal of work toward getting this thing to sell. However, no kudos at all to him for actually writing it. Writing a book isn't as hard as some people would have you believe. All it really requires is a grasp of the English language (or whatever language you're writing in), imagination and a great deal of patience. Because the first thing you write will never, ever be the best thing you write.This book, if not the first thing the author wrote, is at least one of the first things he wrote, and it definitely reads like it. Amateur works tend to show similar flaws to each other, and this one does exactly that. It's copied, in both style and ideas; beginning writers almost always copy in some way. Many start off writing fanfiction, or at least some sort of knockoffs of books they enjoyed reading. All the 'borrowed' elements in this book are an example of how beginning authors - usually unconciously - amalgamate ideas from elsewhere which they liked. It's disorganised - beginners generally don't have much idea where they're going or what they're doing, so they often make it up as they go. It's shallow - just getting the story down is usually a beginner's first concern; depth can come later. It's overwrought - beginners tend to try too hard. And, finally, it's silly. But beginners tend not to be very capable of looking objectively at their own works and seeing their mistakes.From these signs, it is easy to see that Eragon is a textbook example of a beginner's work. There's nothing wrong with writing this sort of thing; it's good practise for later on. However, there IS something wrong with selling your 'practise' book and calling it both good and original. This book is neither good nor original. It is rather the first, stumbling attempt of a first-timer, who lacks the ability to write originally and with elegance. The entire thing is immature and badly organised, and the experienced reader can spot the signs well enough. Even inexperienced readers, including children, are more than capable of noticing the jarring, halting prose and the awkward descriptions.This is why so many are outraged over this book's success; they recognise that it does not deserve it and is not of professional or publishable standard. Nor is it entertaining to read. The best way to describe the storyline is with the word 'annoying'. Such a book should not be making its author wealthy and famous. It is a collossal injustice and a show of contempt toward other, far more talented but less successful writers. Just about every writer longs for recognition, and they are right to be incensed that the recognition is going to someone who has barely mastered the basics of creating a novel.But, a note to any such writers who read this; if this series continues to be as poor as the first book, it is hardly likely to last. The way to get back at this upstart is to publish bigger and better books, and show his readers that there are superior works out there for them to read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"MC has criticized those of us who are hoping for some degree of quality and originality in the books we buy. He claims that \\"everything's been done before\\" and that nothing in fantasy can be original. But, as a previous reviewer stated, this isn't a reason, it's an excuse. I cannot believe that every single possibility for fantasy has been explored and dried up. We have to continue to demand originality or else the fantasy genre will recieve no fresh material and stagnate.Next, MC claims that the critics of Eragon would probably also criticize a book for being too original hence not giving off the proper \\"vibe\\". This is a baseless assumption that MC pulled out of his (censored).Finally, MC and most other Eragon fans praise not the book itself but Paolini's ability to publish the book (which only happened because his parents owned a publishing company). It just shows us the low standards of people who praise individual attempts at self-promotion rather than a truly worthwhile accomplishment.Reviewers, don't fall into the same trap as MC has. Continue to demand quality so that authors can once again bring new and wondrous worlds into the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was obviously written by an inexperienced author, without much grasp of anything beyond the obvious conventions of the fantasy genre. There is soooooooo much better out there, books with depth, thought, realistic characters I actually care about. Eragon is a sad, shallow entry into the market."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My first proposal is that Eragon should not be read by Tolkien fans (such as myself.) His horned orgles could be called enlarged orcs (or perhaps Uruk-hai) his elves - who come from the sea! - are an especial rupture of the very basis of J.R.R.T.'s mythology. The dwarves are mere Nordic folk living in a larger-than-life mountain. The names Hrothgar (in Beowulf) and Balin (the Poetic Edda and The Hobbit) both appear in Eragon. Virtually every name on the map is either direct C.S. Lewis or Tolkien references, or at least similar. I do not find anything paradoxical in Eragon. However Christopher Paoloni, gives little demarcation betwixt plagerism and creativity. For Rowling fans the \\"sorcery\\" in Eragon is nothing like the \\"school-boy magic\\" of Harry Potter. I give him credit for his dragon-riders. In some ways, however, Sephira just seems illogical. For instance, what is the purpose of, you might say, \\"noise with sound\\" if she speaks mentally? If it is to scare away other animals, it seems as though she was already imposing enough in demeanor. I will not draw myself or you into biological enquiries of fictional creatures, however. Instead I will close with this conclusion:Firstly, I give every merit to Paoloni for endeavoring to write a fictional novel despite my dislike of what seems to me almost escapism: continually draws from other authors and not his own intellect. Lastly, if anyone is not as absurdly obsessed with literature, philology and critism as I am, then they may possibly like this book better than myself. Due to this fact, I remain adamant of my own opinion, but open to others."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is one of the best things I have ever read.

I was watching MSNBC news when I saw Paolini being interviewed and just out of curiosity, I bought Eragon and Eldest at the same time. I felt as if I wasn't alone in writing novels and I was comforted. The first few chapters were OK but I was angry and disappointed when Brom died. As I read further I noted that there were some passages from LOTR and SW and Anne McCaffrey's, DragonRiders of Pern in the book and I became angry.It is insignificent that a fifteen year old wrote a novel. It doesn't matter the age of the person...what matters is the book and the words that filled the pages. I do not recommend this book to anybody.

Please do not let the bold print above affect the way you read this review.I have heard people ranting about the nineteen year old genius who began this book at age fifteen. I read and enjoyed it, but please don't blow it out of proportion just because of Paolini's age.I found that the story was rushed in places, reflecting, of course, on his age and the impatience that we all feel at that age. It was written with fairly basic English. Compare it to John Ronald Reuel (J. R. R.) Tolkien's works, which really began fantasy writing as we know it. Lazy and impatient readers complain that Tolkien's books drag on, but I'm here to say that Paolini's first book is rather bare when it comes to details, particularly when looked at next to the art that Tolkien created with words. I can never picture the scenery or characters clearly in Eragon. I do not wish to insult Paolini, I'm impressed by his creativity. However, his is not the kind of book I would buy and read over and over and over and then lament that I allowed a month to pass by since I had last read it.If you want something that moves very quickly and is easy to read, choose this book, but I do advise you to borrow it from a friend instead of purchasing it. If you want true, beautiful fantasy, keep J. R. R. Tolkien in mind. If you love Tolkien's works but tire of his poetic speaking, try R. A. Salvatore, perhaps the greatest fantasy author alive today."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Any fantasy reader understands that the genre isn't known for breaking new ground. Most works are Tolkein clones in some form or another, dealing with the standard hero's quest through a world populated with assorted dwarves and elves. By now all fantasy writers have agreed that elves are tall and beautiful while dwarves are short and live underground-these are simply the tools with which the artist works. When one picks up a fantasy novel, a certain degree of generic rehashing is accepted and embraced.However, I was disturbed by the stale regurgitation present in Eragon. This is the story of a young orphan who lives with his uncle in a land governed by a ruling body known as \\"The Empire.\\" All is well until the orphan finds something of value to the Empire; this quickly leads to the murder of the uncle and a bit of arson. Luckily the orphan is taken in by a mysterious old coot who teaches him the truth. The truth is, of course, that the lonely orphan actually belongs to a lost league of prestigious warriors that has dwindled into extinction throughout the years. He learns of his amazing gifts and his role in the war raging against the Empire. If it all sounds a bit too familiar, you might be expecting George Lucas to file suit.The entire story reads like some bizarre cut-and-paste job. A little Skywalker here, some Frodo there, a bit of Perth, and presto...Eragon. As a matter of fact, I'm somewhat convinced that anyone with a copy of Star Wars, Fellowship of the Ring, a random Anne McCaffrey novel, and a food processor could produce this novel.Imitating and borrowing are by no means unforgivable sins in this genre. Many authors are able to present a strong voice or narrative style to pay penance for their borrowing, but fantasy novels that lack these fresh elements feel like mediocre photocopies of superior originals. This is one of those novels. Here our old familiar ideas are not accompanied by any fresh innovative twists; instead they are partnered with a rather bland and meandering plot line. Half the book is spent chasing someone we never catch, and the other half is spent running from them.Perhaps I am being too harsh. After all, this book was written for children by children. It has found great commercial success with fans of all ages, and I know that hordes children are vivaciously devouring each and every page as you read this review. In addition, I understand that any book children WANT to read is an indisputable success.

The only character that really comes off is Saphira, all the others seem like stereotypes.

Perhaps these facts will lend my opinions some weight.Many reviews focus on Eragon's derivative qualities. I will not.

Shakespeare derived many of his plot devices and dramatical elements from earlier dramas or histories. I will focus on the prose itself.It smacks of immaturity. Adverbial qualifiers abound, particularly for the dialogue. Such adverbial excesses the vast majority of professional writers consider leprous: each additional affliction mars the text further. Many of Paolini's similes seem perfunctory; many are unnecessary. The vocabulary is uneven (witness the clumsiness of Eragon's speech). The pacing is overly rushed towards the end. Saphira is too much a wise mentor, devoid of flaws. The novel itself is rife with scenes that force an adult perspective--piles of corpses being only one, and therefore make targeting it towards youth a mistaken exercise.(...)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What we have here is a kid writing an epic scale book for other kids to read.For all those who gave this book a not-so-great review, perhaps you are reading under your age group.Since this book is professionally reviewed for readers age 10 - 14, I read it to see if it would be over the head of my 8 year old grandson. He's read all the Harry Potter books, so it should be just about right for him.My grandson will not notice the influence of other stories on this young author, Paolini. My grandson will read this book for hours of sheer delight. Just as I read Tolkein and McCaffery in high school before I became an adult and realized how heavily THEY borrowed from the many others who came before.Forget Tolkein's Aragorn!!! Did anyone even notice that replacing the \\"E\\" in Eragon with a \\"D\\" changes the name/word to Dragon? Big-Ups for Paolini's sense of humor.I would be happy to see more reviews from readers within a book's intended age group. It's rather usless for adults to do a pick-apart review of a book created for young readers... All we get is griping about the lack of literary sophistication. As if my 8 year old grandson would know or care.Perhaps the neigh-sayers should read works a bit more elevated on the Literary Ladder.... might better suit their adult tastes. Leave the kids books to the kids.Again, this is a wonderful reading adventure for the pre-high school set. Everyone else's time would be better spent re-reading The Silmarillion.... even if Tolkein did rip off scores of local myths and legends from around the globe."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about this book. Characters are poorly drawn, action is predictable, language is overdone-ie what you would expect from an inexperienced author. Mr. Paolini should have put this one away on a shelf for a few years, then reexamined it. I'm sure he will agree in five or ten years that this was a good first effort, but not publishable material."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Just read the whole book and wished that I had not. What a waste of my time. I kept thinking it would get better but it sadly never did. There are so much better fantasy books than this to pick up (I suggest the LOTR or Harry Potter, perhaps Narnia) that this is just the stockest fantasy story I have ever read. Every scene and dialogue is a cliche! BARF!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Writing Quality: 3/10.I've got to give Paolini props for this story . . . having written it as a 17-year old. It's not particularly better than what other 17-year-old fantasy junkies might write, with the exception that he actually reached the end of a story, which even more capable writers have a hard time doing. Having said that, I would hope that any future aspiring writer would model his work after someone with a little more maturity and ability. I hope that Paolini learns to control his info dumps as he practices his craft. I hope he learns what portions of a story to cut, even when they talk about things he thinks are \\"cool.\\" I have faith in him, since he was so precocious in writing the novel. He writes better than Terry Goodkind does, but that's not saying much for either one of them.Depth of Concept: 2/10.A lot of people criticize Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan for simply recycling elements from The Lord of the Rings, and for that reason I score both of those writers low in this category. Paolini brings it to another level, recycling the recyclers. Note, for instance, the \\"Urgals\\" in the passage quoted above. They are modeled on the big, brutish, half-man, half-beast horned \\"Trollocs\\" in Robert Jordan's stories, which are themselves modeled on the Orcs from Lord of the Rings. And once again, we've got a young person who discovers a special ability who has an older mentor who escapes with him on a journey to fight a great evil. Now, there's nothing wrong with a hero's journey, but if you don't bring something new or insightful to the journey, all it is is a recycled rip-off. I've mentioned this before, but Paolini seems to be writing the story not because he's trying to explore anything particularly meaningful about growing up, but because he's a fantasy fanboy.Rounded Characters: 3/10.As happens with other sub-par fantasy writers, Paolini's characters are on the edge of an extreme emotion all of the time. There is lots of rage and anguish and even scenes where Eragon shouts \\"Nooooo!\\" Such melodrama makes characters hard to distinguish from each other . . . and it makes them less real. But the pendulum swings the other way too. When we might expect Eragon to be in a state of panic about suddenly discovering a dragon (thought to be extinct, and dangerous), he matter-of-factly begins raising it. I'd suggest Jane Yolen's Pit Dragon trilogy for Paolini to dissect and model. And consider this bit of character description: \\"Merlock seemed to flourish and grow every time his wares were complimented. He wore a goatee, held himself with ease, and seemed to regard the rest of the world with slight contempt.\\" We don't learn anything about Merlock from his behaviors, and three defining characteristics are lumped together in a single sentence. Many characterizations follow this pattern, even if bigger characters warrant a full paragraph of description.Well-Developed World: 3/10.Paolini seems to have spent more time on his map than Terry Goodkind did in The Sword of Truth series . . . but in the sense that the \\"world\\" is derivative (with elves, dwarves, and dragons all ripped from the novels of others) of folks whose tales themselves were often derivative, this is not a strong point of the novel. Paolini's world is generic. And on a side note, as I'm looking at the map in Paolini's book, I'm realizing that maps in most fantasy book I'm aware of have a coast on the west, with characters traveling into a harsh, wilderness-type east. And always, always, elves come out of the west, usually from beyond the sea (all of these are tropes established at the start by Tolkien).Page Turner: 4/10.Chapter after chapter, nothing in particular happens. This is mainly because Paolini seems to be in love with his own world so much that he doesn't want us to miss any of it in favor of helping the story get anywhere meaningful. He spends a lot of time with the protagonist mooning about in and around his village, taking even longer for Eragon to get going on his journey than Robert Jordan takes in The Eye of the World. And that's saying something. Everything that he can think of that is cool about fantasy, he wants to tell us about . . . whether it's chapters about learning to sword fight, or learning to do magic, or learning how to ride a dragon. Really what we've got is a bit of wish-fulfillment on the part of Paolini as he wallows in all the things he'd like to be able to do. But these kinds of halts in the narrative are amateurish and boring. Even if you like any of these elements, they could be better incorporated into the story to get it moving along with a better pace.Kept Me Thinking: 2/10.Nope.___________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 3/10.Perhaps this should score higher just for anyone interested in seeing what a 17-year old is capable of producing . . . but it's not a very fun or original read, and there is much better fare out there in the genre and for the audience. It was a phenomenon when it first came out, but mostly because the great mass of fantasy readers just want more material to churn through, no matter how good or bad it is . . . and Paolini's age gave this a lot of buzz.See my profile web site for an expanded review."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I liked it, even though everyone says its a star wars clone.

A tragedy breaks loose after Eragon's uncle dies. Eragon goes after the Ra'zac {the creatures that killed his uncle} to kill them for revenge.Brom the storyteller tells Eragon about his enemy Galbatorix. He also tells him that he has found one of the three eggs that are left. Brom and Eragon go off on a deadly quest to recover the eggs. Will they recover the eggs before Galbatorix does? It's your choice to find out.Friendship, courage, loyalty, and tragedy make Eragon an awesome novel.I love this novel because of the great themes. The themes just make up the perfect book for me. I know for sure that if you read it you'll like it too. This books themes I'm telling you are awesome. It's real cool how Christopher Paolini puts in the themes to make it sound like your there with Eragon.This book is mostly an outside setting. Eragon, Brom, and Saphira travel all over to get information the need to find out how to defeat Galbatorix and how to retrieve the remaining dragon eggs. If you're a person who love dragons and the outdoors then outdoors is the place to be right? Eragon travels to places you'll never think of in the outdoors setting. Sometimes the setting is indoors, like on their way to find the Ra'zac Brom stops at places to get odd items and information about their quest. If you read it I hope you enjoy like I did.Eragon is the best book to read if you're a dragon, action, and outdoors lover.The themes fit so perfectly together to make this novel great.

Will Eragon ever escape Gallabatorix? Will his dragon always protect him?That is where Aragon begins, Eragon is an action packed story, with awesome characters, and mischevious villains. Christopher Paolini uses dark, descriptive text that will catch your eye. Paolini puts so many action scenes in Eragon you wont want to close the book. I belive this is the best book written in a while.Eragon comes across many obstacles throughout the story, and also matures along the way. Christopher Paolini does a very good job of providing all the detail he can in his 497 page book. In this book Eragon learns what it means to have true friends through his companionship with Brom and Saphira. As the story progresses eragon gets stronger and stronger, but will Eragon become strong enough to beat Gallabatorix?

The plot was copied almost exactly from Star Wars. Think about it for a second. It starts with a Rebel convoy being destroyed by an Imperial interception, but the Princess ejects the item that the Imperial taskforce was seeking. Now, if this wasn't in a review of a fantasy book, wouldn't this have sounded exactly like the beginning of Star Wars. Then, a young boy from a farming town finds the item in a field, and eventually his home is destroyed by Imperial forces, and his parents killed. Again, exactly like Star Wars. Then, a mysterious hermit agrees to teach him the ancient arts of a dead order of protectors. Jedi, anybody? Eventually, he dies in the process of saving the Princess. Killed by Darth Vader, no doubt. Then Luke, I mean Eragon, is joined by a Han Solo figure. It just goes on like this for the entire book; a clear and obvious parody of Star Wars. In the end, the evil mage is killed, and we recieve some insight into how he was once a good little boy, but possessed by evil spirits. Exactly like Vader! This is just stupid, and disgusting. Even some of the names of places in this books are from Tolkien. Eragon, sounds a lot like Aragorn, doesn't it? Then, the lake Isenstar. IsenGARD becomes a lake after it's destroyed in Lord of the Rings. Then, the super-orc things sent by the evil emporer sound a lot like the Uruk-hai from Tolkien. Once again, practically copied from Tolkien. And then, there is the corny humor and names, like \\"Saphira\\". Ugggh. I give it a 2 only because it's kind of impressive that a 17 year old published this long of a book, even if the entire thing is a blatant copy of prominent works in science-fiction and fantasy.

I know that many people absolutely love this book, and indeed I can see why. I would like to encourage Paloani to keep on writing, and to develope his style and better himself through experience, as that is virtually all he is missing at the moment."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I should say up front that I gave this book 5 stars in part in reaction to the 1 star reviews which are simply overstating their cases. I can't say this is the best fantasy book I've read, but it was great fun. I can't go with the idea that there's nothing new. If a fantasy book doesn't have dragons, elves, and dwarves, I'm probably not going to be interested. Paolini's approach to the genre is a patient development of the characters while maintaining the pace and fun. If you have to criticize this book because perceived picky editorial snafus--well you're probably hopelessly mundane and thus you're probably not going to have fun with this book. However, if you like battles and swordfights and all that fun stuff--this book delivers the goods.

While reading Eragon I noticed similaities between his book and the hit saga of Star Wars. The pieces came together when I read that Eragon lived under an Empire that fought against a Rebellion (the Varden.) It was a real pity. I thought Christopher had it made but upon discovering that his book was really no more that a \\"fantasy version of Star Wars\\" is was disappionted. As I continued to read more and more clues pointed to my conclusion.-- Eragons uncle (like Luke's) was murdered in the beginning of the book. He was even killed for the same reason and in the same way. Uncle Owen was killed in search of Droids and Uncle Garrow was killed in search of Saphirra. Both died by fire.-- Eragon goes to Brom (a mysteries old man who turns out to be a dragonrider.) Luke goes to Obi-Wan who turns out to be a Jedi. After which both Luke and Eragon leave on a quest of revenge guided by their mentors (Brom and Obi-Wan)--Along the way we learn that the dragonriders once maintained order in the land. The jedi did the same thing. The fall of both the dragonrders and the jedi occured in the same fashion, by the betrayl of a jedi, or a dragonrider.-- They rescue a princess from jail. Lea and Arya were both delievering something when they were captured. (Christopher's substitute for droids is Saphirra)--Brom dies along the way just as Obi-Wan did. And, he died to save Eragon, just as Obi-Wan did. Then after that Eragon meets up with the rebellion just as Luke did. Then they had a battle.-- My guess is that the cripple spoken of in the end of Eragon is going to play the same role as Yoda. He may even be a dragonrider!-- Also I assume that Eragon and Murtagh are brothers. Eragon's father will be Morzan in the same tradition of Star Wars. \\"Eragon, I am your father!\\"Aside from copying Star Wars it has flat characters.

Almost every kind of dinosaur is mentioned. And my favorite dragons are the red cave lava dragon, and the black smoke dragon. This raises my star review by 1.5 to four stars.The main dragons, Bashra the Scottish Silver, and the red Asian dragon, at one part in the story go off together and Wonka Wonka Wonka to produce a dragon egg, but yet again, there is no romance between the two. The author is just trying to get to the next battle scene.Both the young adult version and adult edition are the same book. The only difference being that in the adult edition the citizens and townsfolk aren't so obedient in the beginning; a main character dies; and that leads to a slightly alternate, and extended, ending.My only hope is that the sequel will feature older characters. Over all though, it is a fun read. I guarantee all your favorites are here as dragons and dinosurs battle from the desert, to the swamp, to the wide open grass lands.

Eragon is an enjoyable book of fantasy and coming of age. If you have a child of 10 or older they will like this book. Or if you are older and want something fun to read you will like it too. The book is heavily influenced by Tolkien and Ann McCaffrey, but the author does take the ideas and change them sufficiently to make them his own. The author has displayed the story in such a way that is does capture your imagination. If you are looking for completely original works with twists and turns you would never expect then why are you looking in the Young Adult section? Because that is what this book is for, young adults. And they, or the young at heart, will have fun with this story. If you are a parent with conservative views I do not believe that you will find the book objectionable. The main character is brave, good hearted, and honest. The author is talented and has a long career ahead. I look forward to reading his other books to see how his talent develops.

I have indeed read Lord of the Rings, and although this book seemed kind of similar to the other trilogy, I have read many, many books that are along the same plotlines as Lord of the Rings, which we can probably all agree is the best young adult fantasy ever.I read almost every day, not just for school but because i like it. A lot of my friends have read this book and enjoy it, including my friend Molly who adores Lord of the Rings and thinks that Eragon, while having a similar plot, is an independent story.My lab partner who told me to read it is reading it over for the fourth time.And for those people who insist that they have read better fanfiction, I have too :). Still, those people who are wondering if they should read Eragon due to the bad reviews, I urge you, read it.Especially Ivy---Just Ivy. Unessisary description??????

Shades, evil and powerful wizards, Raz'ak, deathly birds, and many other fiends challenge him, and his many companions in the book. It is full of tragety, and cheers of victory, and surprises at every turn!

After reading a few pages while I was on break at work, I simply had to buy a copy and read it.Taking insperation (and borrowing heavly from Anne McCaffrey), enter the newest teen-age author Christopher Paolini's massive (yes, a hefty 500+ pgs.) debut novel. The plot is about a young 16 year old boy named Eragon who discovers a shiny blue stone while out on a hunting trip. Hoping to sell it for food, he takes it home and discovers that it is actually a dragon egg. The dragon hatches and Eragon's simple, farm-boy life is changed forever. After nearly lossing everything dear to him, Eragon is forced to leave by Brom, the village story-teller (who has a few secrets of his own), who accompanies him on his journey into the detailed world of Alagaesia, a Tolkin-like land full of evil creatures, dwarves, elves, and many more who will become Eragon's allies and enemies.And that's just Book I! Currently, Paolini is hard at work writting Eldest, Book II. While readers eagerly await that novel, Eragon is, by far, the best in what a teen author can produce. While Amelia Atwater-Rhodes may have started the trend, she still has a lot to learn about exceptional grammer and just writting a novel all together. Paolini goes to great lenghts to give his readers a detailed and impressive story that is an udder joy to read. It's hard to imagine that he started this novel when he was only 15!Eragon is seemingly flawless. You get a colorful cast of characters, gorgous landscapes, a plot that doesn't try to hard to be impressvie and flashy, and doesn't live you a rotten cliff-hanger. All in all, I cannot find anything that is wrong with novel.However, my only real complant is that Eragon is a little too \\"meaty\\". The novel doesn't need to be 500+ pages (a standerd 300-350+ is an average for most novels, especially for the start of a Triology such as this) and I found myself wondering on several occassions. But, neverless, I forged on, greatly apperciating on Paolini's masterful skills with the pen.I would recommend anyone who enjoies book like Harry Potter, or just an avid reader of Sci-Fi/Fantasy!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"WOW! If Christopher Paolini keeps writing books like Eragon it will only be a matter of time until his name will be mentioned with the best fantasy writers out there.The story of Eragon is captivating, the characters very real and fascinating and I just adore his writing style. It is very rare nowadays that a 15 year old (now 18) has such an extensive vocabulary.This is a book every fan of fantasy writing must read.

Eragon transported me to a different world, and I hated to leave it. This is one of those books you hate to finish!If you are hesitant to spend 23 bucks on a paperback, all I can say is you won't regret it. Eragon is well worth it.

Galbatorix. We do not feel any real hatred of him or his government, thus we cease to care about anything else in Eragon.One example is the slaughtered village with the speared baby. Galbatorix apparently has no reason for this massacre other than \\"Because he is evil.\\" This is the sort of inane randomness one would expect on Mad TV. Like the Urgals, we are TOLD that Galbatorix is evil but not SHOWN it.Another example is the slave trade. Maybe we could learn to hate the Alagaesian slave trade if we could figure out WHY THE HELL IT MATTERS! The slave trade is tacked onto the plot and could be removed without changing the story in any way. It doesn't matter to the plot, thus it doesn't matter to the reader.Galbatorix is like every other character in Eragon. You couldn't care less about his existance"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wow,I read this book and my first thought was, \\"Wow, is this guy serious?\\" Ninety-five percent of this book(minimum) is a cheap knockoff off LoTR, Dune, Star Wars,and the Belgariad. I've read some peoples arguements that the plot is just the typical epic fantasy plot, and yes, that is correct. It is very similair to how Joseph Campbell explains it, and I have no problems with epic fantasies having a rather repetitive plot line. What I absolutely disagree with is the blatant plagarism of names, specifics, and dialogues. The one that I remember the most, is the exchange at a river, where upon crossing the river, Bron had stolen the money back from the guard character. Now if a person had read \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\" by David Eddings they might think, \\"well, golly gee, that sounds really familiar.\\" And that would be because the exact same exchange goes on, almost to the word. And oh, by the way, Pawn of Prophecy(1982) was written before CP was a twinkle in his fathers eye.Now even if one can look past the \\"ahem\\" similairities between this book and others, the authors writing style leaves much to be desired. It is obviously written at the average fifteen year olds writing level, I half expected poorly drawn crayon dragons in the margin. CP avoids the use of \\"said\\" like the plague, and ends every chapter like a 90's dungeons and dragons game-Eragon falls asleep/gets knocked out/passes out ad nauseum.I'm hoping at this point(if one makes it this far) that a person might ask, \\"well, golly, if CP is such a terrible author, where did all these here five star ratings come from?\\" While I do not know for sure, I would hypothesize that these ratings came from younger readers who have not yet read the full scope of fantasy/epic fantasy out there. I sure hope this one doesn't scare them away.In conclusion I found this book to be dry, severely irritating(due to the \\"similarities\\"), and all an all a waste of space on a bookshelf. So do everyone a favor and don't support this author, read some Eddings, Jordan, Martin, Herbert(sci fi), Hobb, Weiss and Hickman, or any of the other truely original, fantasy authors."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Its like curling up on a winters day with a nice warm blanket, some popcorn, and your favorite movie.

I don't read many books with dragons and elves, but I must admit that this one was worth reading. Mr. Paolini does a good job of develolping the character's personalities, though at times he spends too much effort trying to make some of his characters' backgound more mysterious than it ought to be. I was also disappointed in the level of action in the book, but if you like Lord or the Rings, where a 10 minute scene takes up 40 minutes of film, you will not be bothered. The storyline, however, is good and you can actually see the scenes he describes. I like a book where I can see and feel the surroundings. You will suspect long before the end that this is just the first book in a series, but the finish is good, tying up the storyline well. All-in-all this author's first book is good, but I doubt I would buy another one; unless he writes about something else.

It even inspired me to write a book of my own,(still under construction) though. Anyways read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When Eragon, a poor farm boy, comes across a large blue egg while out hunting, the last thing he expects is that he's taking home a dragon. But soon one hatches, bringing with her an upsurge of danger and adventure. At the death of his uncle, Eragon is forced out into the world beyond his humble home to face terrible foes and realize his destiny as the first of a new generation of dragon riders.Christopher Paolini is an intelligent kid who has clearly read a lot of fantasy, so, having followed the example set by those novels, his own work is fairly fleshed-out -- meaning it's not the worst I've read. The popularity of the Inheritance Cycle (of which Eragon is book the first) is undeniable, but I firmly believe it got kicked off for the wrong reasons, namely the author's age when he started writing the series. If one ignores the hype, as I have tried to do, and examines the quality of the work objectively, there is in actuality quite a bit to criticize and not much to praise.First things first, the writing itself. As I said, Paolini's got a brain in his head, but he isn't a natural writer, not by a long shot. His sentence structure suffers, with regard to tenses in particular. His descriptions wander into purple prose territory, too much so even for the imagery-friendly fantasy genre. Where the largest problem lies, however, is in his blatant overuse of the thesaurus, a common problem which leads to words used incorrectly, phrases that contradict each other or just don't make sense, and a forced narrative that makes it seem as though Paolini wants to impress us with his vocabulary.As for the plot, it is Star Wars wearing a Tolkien cloak, with a little Anne McCaffrey thrown in for good measure. The story follows George Lucas' epic beat for beat (with the exception of the huge dragging section in the middle of Eragon where nothing happens); the elves, dwarves, and overall setting bring Lord of the Rings whooshing back; and poor McCaffrey's lost her dragons and her entire magic system. There's a difference between drawing inspiration from other works, even using similar plot devices or settings, and plagiarism; the lack of originality in Eragon tips it toward the latter. I can't call to mind a single characteristic from the book that is peculiar to Paolini's work.In short, Christopher Paolini's writing has reached a point where it is in effect beyond reproach -- people will buy it and enjoy it no matter what is said by critics such as myself. But as a supporter of the integrity of the book industry, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"OK, so we all get it that Christopher Paolini (CP) incorporated a lot of other works of fiction into his.

The book is NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE!!(NOTE: I honestly don't know HOW the movie producers are going to bring the second book [Eldest] to life on the screen since it doesn't follow ANY of the plot points of the first book.)The book weaves a rich history into a thoughtful story. Yes, there are similarities to other stories (and, yes I HAVE read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings), however, I feel that CP did a really good job on tailoring this tale to the direction he wanted to maneuver us toward.I say it's better than watching prime time TV at this point.

The characters were likeable and I sincerely found it tragic when certain events happened to Brom, Carvahall's Storyteller. It took we two and a half weeks to read, it was worth it, though, and difficult to set down.It starts in the Spine, where young Eragon is hunting deer for his family. Failing, he heads off to leave, but finds himself standing in front of a blue stone. Intrigued he picks it up, and takes it home to Carvahall. He tries to trade it for food, but is rejected by Sloan. So, he dissapointedly goes home.Sounds awaken him from sleep. He rises uneasily and looks around. The stone is shaking. Well, that is because it is not a stone, but an egg, and from it has just hatched a dragon. Eragon's dragon.This dragon, who he names Saphira, sends him off on a remarkable journey, he is now a rider. From this journey comes despair, heartache, friendship, and great gifts and opportunities.I enjoyed this story so much.

On a grander scale, the book is about the battles raging between the oppressive King Galbatorix, and the rebelling Varden, a war which hinges on control of the Riders, of which Eragon is one of only two alive - and the other is King Galbatorix himself.Along the way, Eragon travels with Brom the Storyteller, a secretive but wise old man, and encounters all sorts of vile things, from orc-like Urgals to the evil Ra'zac to the cold-hearted Shade. All the while, his powers grow, as does his dragon, and, as he quickly realizes his effect on the world, he grapples with being forced to take sides in a vast power struggle at the young age of 16.While this is definitely a first-book-in-the-series kind of book, clearly setting up a larger, longer plot, it's a fantastic and quick read, and it will leave you wanting more. If nothing else, it's a perfect book to fill the void while you wait for the next Harry Potter to come out ;) The next book in the Inheritance series should be coming out soon, and I can't wait - if this is how he writes at 15, I can't wait to see his writing matures!(And while yes, this book is targeted at high school-age teens, it's perfectly enjoyable for adults - of course, I think the Harry Potter books are enjoyable for adults as well, so think of that what you will.)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is so awesome... once you pick it up, u cannot put it down.... action and adventure... great book... highly recommended"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"BORING!! I found reading Harry Potter was MUCH more enjoyable then this piece of trash!I found that comparing this book to Harry Potter series is like comparing apples and oranges. The story line is a little slow and at times drags a little. The story could have picked up the pace and quit with all the endless little reminders about how the dragon riders was betrayed and how the king came into power! It seems every time Eragon encounters a new person or a elf or a dwarf, you are reminded about the fate of the dragon riders and/or how the king came into power. And some Eargon's traveling companions and people he meets. It would have been nice if they are suppose to be teaching young Eragon how to use magic and about the history of the dragon riders/elves/drawfs/etc instead of just gives out drips and drabs of it, and giving you, the reader a sense of frustration. Plus do you really need a detail explanation on how to make a dragon saddle??Change the settings to outer space, the dragon to a A.I spaceship and you can compare this with many sci-fi books like the Star Wars series.This author shows promise (NOT!), he just need to pick up the pace a little and make the main charaters a little more interesting."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I purchased and read this book just after it first came out to rave reviews and a New York Times Bestseller ranking. I was extremely dissappointed. There is a reason that there are not many well renowned 18 year old authors out there. The writing is poor at best - definitely the work of someone who is just learning the art. The story is entertaining at times, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, it is entirely unoriginal. This book is fine for the younger child but is not in the class of Paul Park's Princess of Roumania, The Golden Compass trilogy or Harry Potter as books that transcend the line between children's and adult literature. I did not read the second book and have no intention of doing so."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This story was a worthy effort for a 19-year old writer, but he should have worked for another year on the piece before its self-publication. The author utilizes many adjectives, a good tool for describing objects and scenery in a story, but when too many are inserted, especially dull adjectives like \\"big, large, round, etc.\\" a style suffers. Since Christopher is still a very young man and seems to be at a stage in life where writers use their initial success as learning blocks to mature as novelists, I feel we have yet to see the true capabilities of this promising author. Being only 22 years old and a self-published writer myself, I congratulate Christopher for his success in aquiring a book deal with a high paying publishing house. A dream like this comes only to those who persist for achievement in their dreams. Keep on writing, Christopher!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"C'mon people!! this book is terrible!!

And i'm sick of people saying he copied the story line from Star Wars and LOTR. Seriously, do you think those authors came up with those plots themselves? NO. This is a very commonly used plot, and it's hard to find a fantasy book without it. Its fine if you dont like the book, just pick a legitmate reason.And the people complaining about bad grammer, do you seriously think you can blame that on the author? You people are idiots! Thats clearly the publisher's fault.(Btw, I read LOTR and Star Wars before I read Eragon, and I found no problem)Obviously, the people complaing havnt read that many books. They cleary have not relised that most fantasy books follow this theme.1) Harry Potter; Harry discovers he is someone of value, and sets on a mission to serve his purpose.2) LOTR; Frodo discovers he has something of value, and he sets off to destroy it.3)Star Wars: Luke discovers he is someone of value, and sets off on a mission to serve his purpose.4)Percy Jackson: Percy discovers he is someone of value, and sets off on a misson to serve his purpose.5)Alice In Wonderland: Alice discover something of use, and eventually sets off on a jurouny to serve her purpose.6)Narnia: The children discover something of use, and they go on a jurouny to fullfill their purpose.7)Inkheart: Meggie discovers her father has valuable gift, so they set off on a journey to fix the wrongdoing of that valuable gift.8) The Alchemyst(The Secrets Of The Immortal Nicholas Flamel):The twins discover they are people of value, and set off on a journey to fullfill the prophecy.9)Cinderella: She discovers she is someone of value10) The Hunger Games: The characters discover they are people of value.Eragon:He discovers he is someone of value, and sets off on a mission to serve his purpose.I just easily gave you ten famous stories that follow the same story line.Now if you people whould stop be stupid and stubborn, thye would relise this."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, I may not be qualified to write a review, since I could not read this thing past the first chapter. And so, of course, I really don't know about the plagiarism, but I can tell you it was bad writing. Odd grammar, awkward flow (or rather, no flow), glaring holes in logic, some pretense at being descriptive, childish narration (not the good kind as told through a child's eyes, but something like 'The orange and brown cat drank some white milk and then went to happily to sleep'), and the list goes on. I don't see how anyone could've withstood this to the end.There are times when I don't like a book; I'll put the book down and never touch it again. And for these books, I'll even admit they have some merits and I can see how others could like them.

(Along with Eldest) I am one of those weirdo parents who feels I should know what my kids are reading. So, due to my book addiction, I grabbed if off the kid and tore in.First, amazing a kid wrote it. I am not stunned but impressed. I have read some real crap from far more \\"accomplished\\" writers. I found the story well told, the characters brought to life and the balance of detail giving and that left to your imagination good. (Not a fan of seventeen pages of explaining something.)I would recommend this book to most everyone. If you are into the magic thing, this one is for you. If you are looking for a book to share with a young reader, this is for you. If you are all stuck up about books and expecting each thing you read to be a masterpiece, well, read it anyway. Just don't gripe. :)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is so well written that you just cant but help and love it! The story line is awesome and it is well executed. And anyone that is a fan of J.K Rowling should surely check out this book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"That was the sound of my evil laugh when I finally got around to reviewing this book. Although I somewhat enjoyed it when I was reading it, I blanched at some of the plagiearisms. In retrorespect it was not worth my time. The first warning sign came in the prologue when Paolini used \\"unadorned\\" and \\"undiminished\\" in the same sentence. As I recall, it sounded something like ... \\"her clothing was unadorned but her beauty was undiminished.\\" I admit I am something of a nitpicker but this sentence anoyed me beyond belief.I also didn't appreciate the simplicity of the story line. I like to \\"look at the big picture\\" or whatever and find some things I can learn or at least aply to my regular life. The characters in this story though were so perfect that they couldn't possibly be human. I couldn't relate to any of them because they had no flaws. Sure, Eragon makes a couple of mistakes but there's always someone standing behind him to save him or give him advice or fix his mistakes. Like when he gets locked up...Murtagh comes right on cue and the two escape happily into the blue and no harm is done. Yeah RIGHT!The third thing that bothered me was how distant the bad guys seem. Galbatorix isn't seen at all in this book OR in the next. It seems like he shoul dbe more important since he's the father of all evil. Also, Urgals aren't very interesting...a pack of blood thirsty monsters that spear babies's bodies and kill villages. They have no organization, no plan, and whoever is leading them is invincible (of course then we find out its the Shade and when Eragon is about to die Saphira magically appears and Eragon kills him...but that's another story). The battle scene was monotonous, though it should have been interesting, or at the very least exciting. It was basiically just \\"Eragon chopped up an Urgal. Then Saphira was attacked so he killed the Urgals attacking her. They flew up in the air and killed more Urgals...\\" I don't think that Eragon gets seriously wounded at all during the battle, except for maybe a knock on the head...Anyway, I think this book was a waste of time. It was OK to read, like a cheap thrill, but it wasn't very memorable, and overall very annoying. I say save your money for a better series like \\"Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Earthsea\\", or even \\"Gregor the Overlander\\"."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon thinks that the beautiful blue stone he has found is a jewel, but he is not quite right. It is a dragon egg, and when it hatches, the baby inside becomes the best thing that ever happened to him and his truest friend when evil men destroy his home and kill his family. Determined to avenge his kin, Eragon and Sapphira, the baby dragon, join forces with old Brom, a wandering bard who knows much more than his aspect would imply. It is quickly apparent that the king's men were out to kill Eragon, for the boy is a dragon rider, a being thought to be gone forever. With Brom's help, Eragon begins to learn what he needs to know to first, survive, and second, right a hundred year old wrong. But, the road ahead of him and the dragon is a long one, filled with pain and suffering.This is a story simple enough for an older child, but complex enough to hold the attention of an adult. Fans of Terry Brooks or David Eddings will find this a welcome addition to their shelves, no matter what their chronological age.Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Do you like history or middle age fantasy? Than Eragon is the book for you.In this book there is a boy named [you said it]Eragon.He finds a mysterious stone that happens to be a dragon egg.In the story they have lots of adventure and fight to destroy the evil empire Galbatorix.This is a good book for children from 10 to adults.Note that it is pretty long but is loaded with action and magical fun.I love this book and so will you.This story continues in book 2 Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have always loved books that keep you up all night reading when you should be sleeping.Eragon is definitely one of those books, I enjoyed every page. The story is of a 15 year old boy named Eragon who finds an amazing, big, blue stone one day in the forest while hunting. He brings the stone home hoping to sell it to the traders in the fall for food. One night Eragon is awakened by noise comming from the stone, next thing you know a dragon is hatched. Eragon secretly cares for the dragon till one day these magical creatures named Ra'zac show up. One night while Eragon is out the Ra'zac come to his home and kill his family while burning down his farm, and thats when the excitment begins. Eragon and his dragon go through a series of adventures that keep you on your toes dying to see what will happen next. Therefore I recomend this book to anyone looking for a good fictional novel to read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When one considers that this book was written by a young man of 17, one should stand up and clap. But after the applause, Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, should be passed along to the 12-year-olds in your house. The storyline borrows a bit from Harry Potter, another bit from Tolkien, and throws in a lot of video game fantasy for the balance. This will appeal to the younger reader, but it does not have the depth to keep an experienced reader involved. The writing is somewhat plodding and lacks rhythm, and the various devices a young writer learns while studying his craft are obvious. That's not to say this isn't an impressive debut. But when the book is rated for Young Adults, believe the rating. Unlike the Harry Potter books, this story does not travel well with age. For you grownups out there who like a good fantasy read, try the classic Wizard of Earthsea series by Ursula LeGuin, or The Subtle Knife series by Philip Pullman, which features a young girl as the heroine."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Are people really so starved for fantasy that they think this book is good or well written? I can only assume that the positive reviews are from the extremely sheltered. Otherwise they would recognize the cliched and painfully predictable plot from page one. They would see that the characters are the mediocre type casting of someone with little imagination. That the \\"surprizes\\" in the plot are anything but surprizing.But even though reviewer after reviewer points out the obvious people continue to say that this is a highly original work. That they think it's the best fantasy they've ever read. That everyone should read this book.I will spell it out for you. This-book-is-not-good. If you are starved for entertainment, as I was, then check it out from your local library. No need to waste your money on the hardcover or paperback.Why is it bad? It is poorly written because I failed to find a single original thing in the book.First: take the characters from Star Wars. Brom is Obi Wan. Eragon is Luke. Murtagh makes a good Han Solo. Not to mention Arya as Princess Leia. Then you add dragon riding instead of Jedi training. The dragonriding is a faint shadow of The Dragonriders of Pern series. Once again, nothing new here. Add a mockery of the magic system devised by Ursula LeGuinn. Then add the monsters from Robert Jordan's the Wheel of Time series. Urgals instead of Trollocs, and a Shade instead of a Fade. The differences are enough to almost seem original. Then sprinkle heavily with elves and dwarves straight out of Tolkien. (Or is that Dungeons and Dragons?)Even all that could be forgiven if the story itself had been original in the least. But no, we are treated with a plot as bland and prepackaged as a McDonald's hamburger. No plot twist is surprizing. No character entrance or death is not expected. Reading this book was like watching a made-for-cable movie. The idea sounds good, but it just falls short in the execution."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read Eragon long after the hype about how young the author was, how he self-published it through his parents' company before snagging a big contract, etc. The cover art caught my eye first, and I thought I'd give it a go while waiting for the next Harry Potter book. Disappointing -- the main character, Eragon, while very likeable, seems to be stuck in a book-long chase scene without a real plot structure. I know, he has a goal and you can see the formulaic footprints a mile away, but all in all the writing suffers. The climactic scene confused me; I can't figure out, short of wanting a spectacular setting detail shattered beyond repair, the meaning for it beyond the 'same old, same old' escape theme. Will I read the next book? The preview doesn't leave much hope. Was it memorable enough to read the next book? I'd say I'm curious to find out who Eragon's parents were but I can predict pretty well. Maybe I'll riffle through the book at the local shop instead of plunking down my money. Sorry, but I just can't see the point when there are so many GOOD, well-plotted and complex fantasy novels out there. Maybe there's hope for the series as a whole, but it won't ever be ranked as a classic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book seems to be a love / hate book. most people love it or hate it.
