For those who don't know the back story, Christopher Paolini was fifteen years old when he wrote the book. His mother edited it, and his family self published the novel before an editor at Knopf read it and bought it. Now nineteen and at work on the second of what he says will be three stories total, the book is about a young boy named Eragon whose life becomes linked to a dragon, and his destiny promises greatness.As I was reading the book I kept thinking, \\"Wow! A fifteen year old penned this, that's pretty terrific.\\" However I guess that's more a statement of the story teller than the story itself. Paolini is a gifted writer. Clearly there's a wonderful imagination at work and I'm sure he'll have a long career ahead of him. Admittedly he says he grew up reading lots of fantasy books, and they all seem to be here in some form. For a younger reader who is looking for something beyond Hogwarts this will be great. He creates a detailed and textured world that you can lose yourself in including a pronounciation guide and a language dictionary of words used in the book. For readers very familiar with the fantasy terrain this will all seem like rehashed-well Tolkien to begin with. As well as Robert Jordan and Anne McCaffrey. Yet even with the obvious comparisons, I found the book entertaining and well written. I actually thought he managed to move through the story with much less excess than any of Robert Jordans recent books. So if you're not concerned with something not being 100 percent original, you might enjoy this book. I did."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I had the pleasure of listening to this book in mp3 format.This book has all sorts of aspects of other stories.

Nasgul, Lonely mountain, the rohan and a myriad other familiar references riddle this story. The names could be a bit more original.. gets confusing when he is writing about Barad-Dur, I mean \\"Farthen Dur\\"...But this is a fun story.

I can hardly wait for the rest of the series to be released."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One of the presents I received for Christmas this year was Eragon -- complete with personalized autographed signature from the author! My sister was very proud of her gift for me and assured me it was wonderful and would be a collector's item one day.I wasn't so sure - the book is self-published, and the author so young. I'm a voracious reader, but I'd like to think that my taste is discerning, whether I'm reading fantasy or other genres. Tolkien introduced me to the wonders of reading 20+ years ago, when I was in the second grade and I credit him with the fact that I actually have been consistently disappointed with many fantasy novels, because so many simply don't have believable characters, cultures, and/or environments. Other than a few select authors, I actually have come to avoid the genre (for the curious -- Tolkien is a god; I enjoy C.S. Lewis; Anne McCaffrey and her collaborations; Robert Jordan; Elizabeth Kerner; Patricia McKillip ... Ursula K. LeGuin, The Wrinkle in Time books, etc., and do enjoy J.K. Rowling).So I began Eragon fully expecting to be disappointed, and to have to pretend to have liked the book when my sister asked me about it.I would put Paolini's work up with Elizabeth Kerner's, or with J.K. Rowling -- his dragon is well-written, his characters believable (and make mistakes) -- there is a richness in the world he writes which makes me want to know more. I too am anxiously awaiting Eldest. This is just his first foray -- who knows where the world he's created will grow? I think many of us forget that the depth we so love among some of the 'established' authors, was merely hinted at in their first works.I don't know Christopher Paolini from Adam -- I doubt I'll ever meet him. There's no reason for me to want to review this book, other than the fact that I was impressed by his work. One thing of which I am certain -- I am definitely the proud owner of a book which will one day be a collector's item."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The students in my class brought Eragon to my attention. I teach upper-level undergraduate literature classes. It is rare that I hear about books other than the ones in the syllabus. The students are busy with their class assignments and required reading. It is gratifying that they desire to read outside of class.One young woman in my class, Anne, acquired Eragon from her sister in Seattle. Anne read Eragon non-stop two months ago and was effusive in her praise for the plot, characters, and the dragon eye on the book's cover.Anne recommended Eragon to three students in my class who belong to the Society for Creative Anachronism. They are unusual characters. I need say no more. When these three completed Eragon, they talked it up to the rest of my class, which is comprised of 68 students.The syllabus for my classes are set at the beginning of the semester. I cannot change what the requirements for the class are.I saw something in my students that I have not seen in years, namely, strong emotion related to books, so I decided to offer, for those who were interested, a study group on Eragon led by me, not my teaching assistant, outside of class hours.I needed to read Eragon first. I do not read much popular fiction. I was pleasantly surprised, entertained, and enjoyed Eragon. It is a diamond amongst the formulaic novels that bookstores love to sell.The study group was offered on a voluntary basis; no extra credit was to be earned by attending. I was astonished to find 31 of my 68 students at the study group. We have met three times to discuss Eragon's plot structure, characters, character development, themes, archetypes, and continuity. We also compare and contrast Eragon with other similar books.I can heap nothing but praise for the young author of Eragon, Christopher Paolini. He has made my job easier by stimulating the minds and emotions of my students. I hope that they continue through the rest of their lives to find books like Eragon, books that fire the imagination.You have my thanks. Never in my twenty- two years in the university milieu, have I ever had students want to do anything outside of class, least of all, a non-credit study group for a non-required book, one that does not count toward their class grade. I will work Eragon into my required reading list next fall and make it part of my curriculum.Thank you, Christopher Paolini. You have made my job as a professor fun again.Karen Anderson"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just finished reading this fine book- staying up late each night long after I should have gone to bed in order to read &quot;just a bit more&quot;. Each time I tried to guess ahead to the outcome of a situation, I was outdone by the author, who created an excellent world, populated by very believable characters.Structurally, the book is so well written, that at times it leaves the realm of prose and reads more like fine poetry, not with meter and rhyme, but with the beauty and rhythm of words and images flowing together. To say much about the book would be to take away some of the surprise, but suffice it to say that it is a book very well worth reading, and then passing on to a friend. I'll purchase a copy to give to a talented teenager, just so that they can see how far one can go at that young age. While the book stands very solidly on it's own two feet- I find it very inspiring that it was written by one so young. This author is likely to have a well known name before he sprouts a beard!

Paolini paints a vivid picture in a richly developed story and set of characters. It captured my imagination. Eragon is breathtaking in its scope. It's rare for me to remember much of a book after I'm done reading it, yet Eragon's storyline and characters get under your skin, and everything is so real.This book ranks with Tad William's Otherland series, Tolkien's Middle Earth, Jordan's Wheel of Time, Brooks Shannara, Eddings's Belgariad and Malloreon, Feist's Krondor and Magician.Buy it, steal it, rent it, borrow it.

Christopher Paolini is not some evil unoriginal teenager who couldn't come up with his own ideas so he had to steal others.. he did what every other writer does namely let works they love inspire their own work!

And if you think that taking a word, reversing it, then using that new word to mean something in your own book is plagarism than you have more problems then you know!Oh, and don't even get me started on the \\"sentence structure\\" debate a few reviews down. In many cases simple sentence structure is the best. Oh no, you're right. Ernest Hemingway, Robert Wilder, the list goes on.. are horrible writers because they speak their thoughts clearly in short concise sentences. Which by the way, is also the writing style of J.R.R.

The main problems: dialogue- awful, make's the characters much worse than they already are, and that's pretty hard; character development- ever hear the term cardboard character? if you want a definition read this book; copy cat!- Eragon is a poor imitation of many books, mainly The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.

Star Wars. All that with with LOTR names and terrain style. I have nothing against this new author who has a promising future(or rather set now), but needs work just like any new writer.

Paolini was 15 when he started writing this epic tale, and 17 when it was first published. That alone is extremely impressive. But I would have loved it just as much if an adult wrote it.Originally, I wasn't going to read the book, even though I had heard of it. But then, I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie. I was intrigued. Boy, was I glad I did.This is a wonderful coming-of-age story. Eragon is a young teenage boy who was raised by his uncle in a poor village. He happens upon a mysterious rock that ends up changing his life. As Eragon matures and goes off in search of two killers, he is trained by a strange old man named Brom.I was immediately swept up in the book within the first chapter. This epic tale of fantasy and lore is not only beautifully written, but exciting as well. There are quite a few surprises along the way. And all of the characters have depth and unique personalities.This is the first in a trilogy, Eldest being the second book that was just recently released. I plan on going out and getting it soon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off I will ask you to pardon my bad grammer, it's never been one of my strong suits, but i'll try anyways.What are alot of Fantasy books made of these days? why sword fights, massive battles,magicians and cruel empires of course. While \\"Eragon\\" has all those traits, it offers a little more depth in the way of a story. Eragon starts off in the little town of Carvahall(i think i spelled that right) with the main character, whose name suprisingly enough is \\"Eragon\\". Eragon lives with his uncle and cousin Roran, who live on a poverty stricken farm. We first meet Eragon, hunting for food in a dangerous part of the mountians surrounding his hometown known as the spine. Eragon is unsucessful in hunting, but he does however stumble across a blue stone. Eragon pockets the stone, thinking it will fetch a fine price at the market. However, the stone doesnt sell, no one in the town will pay a good price for it, and the traders which come to Carvahall yearly dont know what it's worth, and therefore wont purchase it. Later, Eragon is sitting in his room testing the hardness of his rock, and subsequently, it hatches; ironically into a baby dragon. Eragon is given a burn or something from the dragon, that at first causes him ingcredible pain. The burn however leaves him a mark, which Eragon suprisingly enough has no idea what it's for. In the weeks that follow, Eragon cares for this dragon which he subsequently names Saphira, by sneaking it food, building it a shelter, etc etc. However there is a problem, this dragon is growing bigger and bigger, and is showing no signs of stopping. Eragon seaks the advice, of local nut, and town story teller, Brom. Eragon questions Brom about the Dragons, and their riders from the pasts, while being careful not to reveal that Eragon himself has a dragon. This secret doesnt stay hidden for long, within anothr week or so two cloaked figures arrive in Carvahall and begin asking the towns people if they knew anything about the stone Eragon found, weeks before hand. Eventually they discover Eragon has the stone, and travel to his uncles farm, but no Eragon isnt there, him and his trusty she-dragon Saphira are long gone, flying to who knows where until morning. Eragon eventually convinces her to return in the morning. However when the happy couple return they find the farm destroyed and Eragons uncle, badly wounded. Eragon takes him back into town and recieves care from the towns people both for hhis uncle and himself. Eragons uncle eventually succumbs to his wounds and Eragon is left in mourning. Within a day or so Eragon decides to take Saphira and dish out a little bit of revenge on the strangers who are then identified as the \\"Ra' zac\\"(or something like that). But not without the help of town nut, and story teller Brom. From then on out the unlikely Trio is forced into a world of conflict, and must fight to find out who is for them and who is against them.Pros: colorful characters for the most part, the story is kept in balance, the battles are done decently well, the whole idea of the dragon riders is very interestingm the 'Shade' you meet in the book is an excellent villianand the story, although nothing really new, is still done reletivly well.Cons: This is the authors first book; and it shows, while its far from awful, it's not exactly 'classic' material either. The story sadly is that of your average fantasy story, with a few extra coats of pain,\\"unlikely hero doing extrodinary things, with an epic romance involved\\" leaving 'Eragon' short of being a 'memorable' tale. Even though the movie based in the book that is currently in production looks decent enough (except for the Shade!!!, he looks like a red haired bum!\\"Final opinion: while this isnt exactly a ground-breaking story, it manages to keep the reader intertwined in the story long enough for he/she/it to get through the story without much trouble, so all in all, Eragon is worth the read, as long as you dont mind a few rough edges.Reviewers note: thanks for reading and i hope my bad grammar and punctuation wasnt to bad ;)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As said before, there is s slight resemblance to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

(and I am in my thirties, for those who say it's just for teens). I am also an avid Star Wars fan, and from the very first page of this book I began to notice direct and obvious parallels between the plot of \\"Eragon\\" and the plot of \\"A New Hope\\" (Star Wars Episode IV). I was hoping that these parallels would fade away as the book went on and it would take its own more original path, but instead they increased and became even more strong and more obvious. So this was a HUGE distraction for me while reading, and made it hard for me to lose myself in the story.I have even thought of writing Mr. Paolini to ask him if these parallels were intentional and conscious because they are so exact.Others have pointed out many elements in \\"Eragon\\" that are taken from other major fantasy authors (Tolkein, Le Guin, etc), but the fact that the plotline was truly almost exactly the same as that of \\"A New Hope\\" was what stood out the most to me. I did enjoy it nonetheless, but I am hoping that the plot of the sequel will not be a parallel of the Empire Strikes Back!I would give it 3 stars, but it gets an extra because this was the young author's first book and as such was a good offering."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It really sounds like he copied the works of many authors, mainly one in particular. Although I do not think he copied the works of Tolkein, for I found little similarities. It sounds as if he took many of his ideas from author David Eddings, mainly from his series the Belgariad. The names Paolini uses sound almost too similar, for instance the group called the Urguls.Eddings has a group called the Urgos. Coincidence? The names of the main characters also ryhme. Eragon rymes with the name Garion as it has many similar letters. He also took the idea of the gedwey ignasia or the silver palm. Garion is a young man who is destined to become king and is also a wizard.THe silver scar on his palm is the source of his power and it glows when he uses his magic. He has powers that work much like that of Eragon's. Early in the series a very old storyteller travels with him and teaches him how to control his powers. Most astonishingly, in Garion's quest the storyteller teaches him how to lift a boulder with his powers, levitate it, and set it back down. This scene is exactly the same as when Eragon is taught by Brom to lift the rock. Although there is no dragon in the Belgariad, the relationships of the characters and the names are almost too similar to be coincidence. Eragon was a great book, but its origin the Belgariad was far better and had more characters who were far more developed. Paolini needed to speed more time on character development, as when Brom died I did not feel for him as much as I did for the Storyteller named Belgarath when he was hurt badly in a duel with another magic user. As I read Eragon it was so similar I found myself wishing my favorite characters from The Belgariad would show up to save the day, but they never did as Paolini lacks characters. Maybe these stories were read to Paolini as a child and he subconsciously wrote it into a story of his own. Maybe he has never heard this story, but the work of Eddings is far too similar to his to be just a mere coincidence. One thing is for sure, if you were not fully satisfied by Eragon, more comedy, adventure, and character interaction awaits in the stories of The Belgariad by David Eddings."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"But it was poorly edited. The beginning of the story took a hard effort to get past. The middle was intriguing and for a good section of the book I cared about what happened to the characters. By the end, though, I had lost interest in the story, and I started to see the warping of the cliches. Not only did he take overused sterotypes or sets of characters, he twisted them and reapplied them in a way that just did not fit, to me, like an elf with a tatoo or a young man who spends a few weeks or months training with a sword and all of a sudden he is the best swordsman the seventy year old man had ever heard of. Also, he put a lot of effort into a large number of descriptions, only to not capitalize on the effort, like the intricate description of the wounded man going up stairs to see his critically wounded kin. He detailed that very well-only the young man got there, and left, because he could do nothing.All these flaws could be attributed to youth and he will make a good writer someday, but this story holds no interest for me-and five stars for how well he did so young"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As I was reading Eragon, I got really into it.

Then during the whole Star Wars mania, I ended up watching the original 3 Star Wars movies and there was my answer. Eragon is pretty much just a midieval retelling of Star Wars. Same plot, identical characters, just different names. The worst part is that Christopher Paolini doesn't even site that he used Star Wars' plot!

This book is essentially LOTR with the names changed! I made a list of comparisons and differences and the similarities far outnumber the differences. The family of Tolkien should look into this! Not to mention how slow going this book is! every other page the characters have to stop and rest and sleep and eat, then fight then do the same thing all over again! Oh yes, let's not forget the Star Wars references in there too! Read the LOTR if you want the original story!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm a 13 year old boy who likes fantasy and i can see how this sort of book is supposed to appeal to someone like me. i wrote a very long review but decided not to post it mostly because i felt it was, well, just too long. so i'll try to make it short and sweet.this book reminds me of the kind of fiction i used to do when i was in elementary school for creative writing. to me that sort of says that this was published because his parents owned a publishing company, not because it was exceptionally well done considering the author's age.the story, setting, development, characters, etc. are nearly all taken from some place or another, given new names or details or something, and shuffled around. i won't nitpick over this because a lot of other reviewers have but some of the elements of this book seemed to be ripped straight out of LotR, Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle, Anne McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern series, and Star Wars. (all of which i have seen or read) other reviewers have talked about numerous other books that the author has taken things from. its one thing to be influenced by other stories and show those influences in your writing. in fact, its a good thing, it makes your writing better. no book is totally original, and many classics are made because the authors took things that influenced them and that they liked and incorporated them. but is this different. nothing new is done with these ideas or characters, and it all feels rehashed and kind of boring.and the writing isnt so great either. yeah its his first book but that doesn't give him a blank check. the descriptive writing was pretty good but even that got kind of overdone.and this is sort of a stupid thing to say but the names in this book annoyed the hell out of me. Brom, Farthen Dur, Isenstar, Ayla, Eragon, Saphira or whatever her name was. Gahh.So in the end what I'm trying to say is this:Don't bother. This book has a lot of hype mainly because the author is so young. its not Totally awful or anything but there are a huge deal of things in it that come straight from other stories. the author will probably turn into a better writer i think, and maybe the other books will turn out to have some more quality to them. after all, this is only the first third of a series, things could improve a lot. but for now, just look for something else besides eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read, and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention.

I thought, hey, let's get a novel we could read together. My eyes fell on \\"Eragon\\"; and every kid within ear distance kept correcting me on the pronunciation of the book. I read the back cover about how a kid wrote it, best selling novel, blah, blah. So I thought it would be good read for all of us. I decided to screen it first and...Boy, it was very painful. The story itself was pretty good, but such a terrible execution. The dialogue was awkward, the story very choppy. The violence (ex. baby dead on top of a pile of bodies) was so forced and unnatural. Personal conflict with characters was unrealistic. The characters would be \\"irritated\\" or \\"snappy\\" about silly things. Clearly the author has little life experiences.I know, I know, a kid wrote it. But why so much hype on it? I can't believe they are making a movie out of it and everyone is so excited about a work that is equal to a high school writing contest contribution. Most of us probably couldn't write a better novel but clearly this book rode off the author's age than actual ability.The more I read, the more annoyed I got with the story. The dragon, which should have been the most interesting aspect of the book, lacked depth to her character. She was born, then crawled around, and then bam! She was a mature, wise dragon. Both Eragon and the dragon seem like strangers with no history or connected emotion. All the characters were hard to like. Just an all around badly written book. Paolini does write good imagery but it sounds like stolen passages from the many fantasy books he has read.I highly recommend this book for older children, there is way too much death and violence (even though it is weak) for anyone under the age of 12, but way too immature of anyone over the age of 16.

True, he started writing at age 15 and has managed to write three fantasy novels with a fourth one still to come. However, how much longer can his age account for a body of work that is mediocre at best?For starters, the book is packed with every cliche that could possibly be associated with the fantasy genre. I can find little to no original content here, but to be fair, original ideas are a bit hard to come by these days in any genre, fantasy or otherwise. Still, that's not much of an excuse. Believe me, Paolini and J.K. Rowling don't even compare! The author \\"Borrows from\\", or more appropriately, rips off ideas from classic books like The Lord of the Rings and the Star Wars movies. The plot is essentially Star Wars only forget the outer space setting and replace it with a middle ages fantasy world. The characters are paper thin and have no emotional depth. The writing is also terrible, forcing the reader to trudge through overly flowery dialogue and descriptions that are not necessary to understand the meat of the story (if any).Naturally, no matter what I say, there will be legions of fanboys who will be begging for more of the Inheritance series. I don't dislike fantasy, but Eragon is simply not my cup of tea. As an author who takes so much from other sources, how much will Paolini have of his own to give back in return?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is a good book to sit down and read as a family.

Really, about 450 pages is devoted from going one place to the next ala Dungeons and Dragons, sans anything exciting happening. The dialogue is poorly written. As script editor, I am always telling my writers to make their dialogue sound natural. After all, people tend to write more formally than they talk. This is a lesson that Christopher Paolini did not take the time to learn when he set out to write this.Both the narrative and the dialogue do get better when they finally reach the home of the Vardens, about 400 and some odd pages in. But it take a tremendous effort to get there, both on the part of the characters and the readers. Unfortunately, by this time, whenever he stops to describe something, you're too burned out by the reaaaaallllllyyyyyyy looooonnnnnggggg expositions that took place during the first 4/5th of the book and now you can't take any more.This book got a lot of good reviews. For the life of me, I can't understand why. On the other hand, it also got a lot of bad reviews. I'm in that camp.

Let me qualify that, let's consider the story,We start with a princess (representative of a rebellion against an evil empire) who is carrying their last hope (the egg). Her convey is attacked by the dark disciple (who has dark mystical powers) of the evil king (who also has dark powers) and is is taken the an terrible fortress and tortured about the location of the egg and the rebellion. It's worth noting that the evil King and dark disciple hunted down and killed all the other good guys, who were defenders of the peace before the days of the evil empire.Meanwhile a young farmboy finds a dragon egg: the last hope of the rebellion. The farmnboy is being raised by his \\"uncle\\" and being watched over by an old storyteller, who actually also has the same powers and the dark king and disciple ... Anyway, as one might expect, the uncle dies at the hand of the evil empire. This gets the old storyteller, now a mentor, to start training the farm boy in the old ways and powers (+ to ride his dragon).On their travels to the rebellion, they rescue the princess who is being held by the evil disciple and in the process, the old story teller gets killed. The princess and farmboy then go to the rebellion and with a new rougue-ish friend help defeat the empire in a big battle to save the home of the rebellion (well for a little while).This is all eeringly familar ...

I grabbed this book in it's original edition (when Paolini first published it himself) at a used bookstore. Why? Because I enjoy fantasy and am completely fascinated by different people's takes on dragons. And I don't regret for a minute picking this book up. There's a reason Paolini was picked up by a major publisher and they re-released this book - it's just plain good.Some might criticize his classic themes of good and evil, but I think those themes are classic just because they're so basic and foundational to mankind. And Paolini is just starting something in this book. The cliff-hanger at the end is one of the most abrupt I've encountered, and it really left me thirsting for more. I'd suggest at least getting your hands on the second before starting the first, that way you can just read them back to back without ever having to stop (like I did - it was two years before I got my hands on the second book!).So if you're in the least bit intrigued by or enjoy fantasy, pick this up. Paolini obviously has read and enjoyed Tolkien - and if there's an influence I'll never argue with, Tolkien is it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One of my brothers told me that I should read this book before I saw the movie, and so I did. I have to say that the story may not have been original in some aspects, but what story is? For every idea that is made up, it can be connected to something that has been previously done for any type of story.As far as originality, who cares. The story is well written, and the plot points are explained flawlessly. This story begins with a mere farm-boy who stumbles upon a dragon egg. This egg, when it hatches makes him the first dragon rider in over 100 years. As the story progresses, Eragon comes in contact with a trainer who teaches him how to fulfil his destiny as a rider.Although the story is predictible to an extent, it is very enjoyable to read, and I have to say that the plot twists to the story are incredible. I think that this book could be enjoyed by anyone who wants to take a break from reality and read something that deals with pure fantasy. I feel that this book could be enjoyed by people of all ages, but not all imaginations. If you do not have an imagination for the stuff of fantasy, then you may not like this."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First of all, I am going to try my best to keep this review neutral; neither fall-on-your-feet-and-worship or this-is-the-worst-book-I've-ever-read kind of review. Second, I will try not to mention Paolini's age.Now, to the book.The first three to five chapters of Eragon are not the best in the world and certainly not as good as the ones following; I think we can see Paolini improving as he gets more practice. They are rather short and choppy, and the action and discription not the best. But don't let that stop you, for the book improves rapidly after that.Eragon would, on a scale of one-to-ten, probably get a 3 or... a 5, maybe, for originality. There are the usual graceful and mysterious elves, stocky, gruff dwarves, mighty dragons... and so forth. You can also catch several elments from Tolkien's master work, ie, the elves came from over the sea on silver boats, they live in a huge forest ruled over by a great elven queen, and the \\"urgals\\" are very like the orcs from Lord of the Rings.But mind you, the story still has its own twists. For instance, the city-mountain of Tronjheim. That, in my opinion, is nicely written and thought-up. Also, Eragon and Murtagh's flight through the valley to the Varden. That nearly had me on the edge of my seat.I'm not going to go through the whole storyline, since I hope you will read the book for yourself, but I will say that anyone who has read Tolkien, please don't get you hopes up to high. Eragon is a good book, but nowhere near the level of Lord of the rings.I recommend Eragon to ages ten through fourteen, but anyone above that (younger than ten might have problems with the battles and other, maturer, things) age can read and enjoy this book too."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's not as good as Tolkien, and a different universe from Harry Potter, but a good read all the same.

WARNING!!!>A young boy named Eragon, raised by his Uncle Garrow and Aunt Marian in the land of Alagaesia, where the evil King Galbatorix lords over the land, finds a saphire colored egg and thinks it is some sort of valuable stone. He tries to sell it, but it ends out hatching, and revealing a small dragon inside.Eragon raises the dragon, and gleans information about them from Brom, the village's storyteller. He gives his female dragon the name 'Saphira', from a dragon name that Brom gives him.Soon, evil beings called the Ra'zac come to Eragon's village, and murder his uncle Garrow (his cousin Roran being somewhere else, and his aunt having died years before), leaving Eragon with a heavy thirst for revenge.Brom finds Eragon and Saphira, says he knows about dragons, and insists that he allow him to train Eragon, so he might live though his quest to kill the Ra'zac. Eragon agrees, and him and Brom and Saphira leave, for the Ra'zac are leaving, and the trio don't want to lose them.After dropping off at a massacered village, having Eragon's fortune told by Angela, and getting information from Jeod, a wealthy merchant and an old friend of Brom's, they try to find out the Ra'zac's hiding place, which leads to them fleeing for their lives from Hellegrid.While on the run from Ra'zac, they get attacked, and Brom is wounded. A young man named Murtagh rescues Eragon and Saphira, and offers to help them with their quest. They reach a hidden cave, where Brom wakes up and tells Eragon he was a Dragon Rider, and that his dragon, Saphira, was killed by the traitor Morzan. He then dies, leaving Eragon heartbroken.Shortly after they get captured, and Eragon meets Duraz, a evil Shade that is intent on learning Eragon's true name (learning the true name of a person will allow anyone control over a person). With a little bit of luck, Eragon and Murtagh escape to join Saphira, rescuing a elf woman in the process.When they reach safty, Eragon heals her, and finds out from her mind the way to the Varden, and that she must have medicine from them is she wants to be healed. They journey there, where and Saphira discover that Murtagh is Morzan's son, (Morzan being the traitor Dragon Rider that allied with Galbatorix, the evil king of Alagaesia, to kill the rest of the Dragon Riders and in doing so killed all the dragons that did not escape Alagaesia), and ally themselves to the Varden.A battle is waged, and Eragon and Saphira must fight against the Shade Duraz, or die in the process...&lt;SPOILERS END HERE>All together, a great book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book redefines derriviative.

There's not really that much happening on its 500 pages but Eragon traveling from his birth place to the Varden who are the opposition to Galbaroix. He meets several people on his way who help train him and he does fight some bad guys but that's about it.The dragon automatically grows into a wiser big sister type of figure and it bothers me that no experiences on her side are necessary to make her so. Eragon also appears to just be swept along by events and doesn't undergo much development.

Can't wait for the final one.

Listening to Eragon really helped the time move along more pleasantly. I enjoyed it. Do I think it is highly derivative? Absolutely. Borrows very heavily from Tolkien (in fantasy, it's hard to avoid), McCaffrey, Leguin and her EarthSea books, etc. for characters and environment. I would not be surprised to find the author has to pay royalties to the Star Wars franchise for the plot.In spite of that, I still enjoyed it. Perhaps it is like listening to a \\"tribute\\" band. Maybe it really isn't The Beatles or U2 playing the song, but the melody is still there, and you can tell the band really loves the music, even if it's not theirs. In Eragon, there is a feeling of reverence for the fantasy genre that shines through, even if the world he weaves is not as compelling as those from some of the giants of the field.Overall, it's a pleasant and at times engrossing story. Nice job.PS. The Eragon movie was absolutely horrible. The screenplay seems to have been written with a complete disregard, even disrespect, of the original story. Other than the names, it bears almost no resemblance to the original. Not only that, the production values were more suited for a made for tv movie. A BAD made for tv movie."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This isn't a bad story for something written by a 15-yr-old.

Don't waste your time reading this when there are far better fantasy books out there."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Being an avid lover of fantasy, I was hoping that this book would be one of the few fiction books that are genuinely original, (the ones that come to mind are the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and the Spiderwick Chronicles.)I confess myself slightly disappointed.The one thing that was the most bothersome to me was the Ancient Language. Being the language of the elves, I expected it to be less crude, and some of the words were just plain ridiculous. In my opinion, including a new language is too overwhelming for my liking. Another thing that this book seriously lacks is originality, which I find makes a big difference in the enjoyability of a book. The Urgals are much like the Orcs in LOTR, amd I see the similarities between Middle Earth and Alagaesia. There are other things that I could point out too, but I'd feel really bad criticizing a book more than I feel obliged too.However, this book is immensely entertaining, and I'm astonished that Chirstopher Paolini was only 15 years old when he began this endeavor. Something that I'm also happy with is that the character Arya (an elf) isn't another one of those helpless women whom men are left to rescue because they are incapable of rescuing themselves. Eragon only saved Arya because she was unconsious and had been cruely tortured in ways that would've killed a human. Though I have to admit, Arya's beauty and sheer pity also contributed to Eragon wanting to rescue her. Seeing through all the things this book lacked, you have an excellent story. I'm looking forward to reading Eldest, and I'm hoping that as Christopher continues with his aspiring career as an author, his work will gain a bit more originality and personal flair."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you like fantasy books Eragon is the perfect book for you.

Read the book if you want to find out!I like this book because Christopher Paolini used a great idea for a storyline. Also he uses extraordinarily vivid explanations so you can really visualize the situation. Here is an example; A vast expanse of dunes spread to the horizon like ripples on an ocean. Bursts of wind twirled the reddish gold sand into the air.I'm a fantasy book expert and of all the fantasy books I've read this is the most unique in that you even get attached to the characters. So if someone dies you actually feel very sad. Also no other books have a plot as good as this one.This is truly the greatest book you will ever find. So when you are done reading this book review, run over to the bookstore and BUY ERAGON!!!!!!!! If you thought this book was good then read the second book of the trilogy, Eldest. And if you have a minute of extra time before buying Eragon read the warning.WARNING: You will not be able to put this book down until you finish the last word of the last sentence of the last paragraph of the last page of the last chapter of the first book of the trilogy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! It has been my favorite book for a long time, and I read all the time. This book is about a poor boy who has a dragon hatch for him. He finds out that there is a person in his village that has a lot to do with dragons and sets off on a remarkable journey... if you haven't read this book, it is a MUST read!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read the reviews and then bought the book to see for myself what everyone was talking about. You know, people are so critical of fantasy novels, when each of them, Tolkien included, is something written based on something that existed long ago. No story is completely new; only retold in a new way. Have any of you ever read Irish mythology? It's quite a bit older than dear J.R.R. Tolkien, and I enjoyed Tolkien's work considerably when I was a youth.So, what's wrong with a fantasy that a young teenager can read for pleasure and enjoy, or perhaps even daydream about? What's so bad about a published book by a young many that may have been musings on a \\"Fantasy Fan's\\" notebook or journal? What's so bad about a book that has no sexual allusions, just a story that teachers can read without worrying about parents disapproving, granparents and parents can buy without hesitation that undertones may not be appropriate for their young.If we start to critique and destroy young, creative minds by not allowing them a place in fantasy genre that is age appropriate, what will be written in the next generation?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hmmm...This book is listed as JUVENILE FICTION for YOUNG READERS, yet all these reviews seem to be from over-analytical adults! This book was written by a young person, for young people, so no wonder it doesnt appeal to you serious intellectuals (*cough*). For the author's age and considering the audience it is intended for, I think its a decent enough book. Does it borrow inspiration from other works? Of course. In fact, name one author or work of art that HASNT been inspired by something else - the trick is taking that inspiration and making it your own, which I think the author did well enough considering his age. At the very least, its getting kids away from the TV and into books, which is hardly a bad thing. I'm not a kid, but I've seen lots of kids reading this book lately which even inspired me to pick it up. So take it for what it is, a solid work of JUVENILE FICTION and stop trying to compare it on the levels of Tolstoy, Hemmingway, or even \\"Bored of the Rings.\\" At least Christopher Paolini is writing something worthwhile instead of being a bitter Amazon reviewer and writing spiteful reviews."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Great book.

This is one of my favorite fantasy books though I wouldnt re-read it because it I already know whats coming and I just don't like re-reading books.This book is really good book because it's sort of different then other fantasy books. It was filled with plenty of action which I like about it. My favorite part was when he killed Durga because it was during the fight for the rebel base that was hidden in the mountains. Also because he was the one who pretty much caused Eragon to meet Sapphira even though that reason isn't a good one. Although the action parts are cool the non action parts are somewhat dull and boring even if they might be important and an informative part of the story. Even so the action parts make up for all the dull moments. Overall this book was a pretty good book.Another good action part is when Eragon is in an abandonded town and gets ambushed while still learning how to use his newly obtained magic. During the fight he unleashes great amount of magical fury upon the orcs that ambushed him. He used a spell called Brisingr to give his sword a sort of \\"power boost\\" by setting it on fire. He also does the same thing to kill Durga AFTER he almost gets killed. Of course this action ends the fight for the rebel base and saves the base at the same time.I would recomend this book to any one who likes action fantasies and has enough patience to make it through the boring parts.S.Brock"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you have a boy that is into dragons be sure to buy the first and second book of the series. I struggle with buying it this year because it will leave you hanging because the third book is not yet in print and it is a bit awkward to go back and pick it up a year later. If you are trained to wait for Harry Potter then start buying the set right away. Be aware.This is a well done story and you will find it gripping because of the connection to the boy and his Dragon. It is the classic American tale- orphan finds trauma or struggle and is forced to look at how he was raised versus the bad blood he has come from. Star Wars lovers will see a very similar theme in the bad guy of this series and it is the Star Wars saga with Dragons. Get it in hardcover because you will want to keep it and many schools are putting it on the recommended reading list for age 11-16. This is not a book for little-little kids. There is violence and gore- perfect for an older boy and great for parents who still read with older children.RICH CHICKS specializes in media that is purchased by women.

It all started when he makes a last desperate hunt for game before the harsh, cold, and deadly winter comes. Instead of catching game, he finds a pretty blue stone. He comes back home to find that the whole town thinks that the stone is nothing but a ball of evil magic. After taking to a trader, Eragon finds that he cannot sell the stone, cannot trade the stone, and he just can't let the darn thing go. Later in the month Eragon wakes up to find the stone breaking in front of his very eyes! After it has completely shattered on the the ground, Eragon is shocked to find a dragon staring at him. The dragon has blue scales that are hardly visible because of the membrane. The next day Eragon makes the decision to hide the dragon in the woods and come to it every day after his chores. Eragon gains a extremely cool skill; he can talk to the dragon with his mind and nobody can hear them. The dragon names itself Saphira. After the king finds this out, he orders his servants to kill him and take the dragon. This king is one of the great dragon riders who used to fight evil and save the towns. One rider betrays them and kills them all and their dragons. A day or two before the murderers arrive Roran (Eragon's brother) leaves to go work for a farmer, Eragon finds his uncle Garrow killed and his house destroyed. Soon he decides that he will set off to assassin the people who did this. Before he goes, Brom finds him and goes with him. This book was very much like Lord of the Rings and I liked it a lot.

The biggest problem is deciding which version to try - FIRST.The greatest treasure of all (probably because I use it EVERY Sunday) is the basic waffle recipe.

It should not be viewed as a scholarly work of biblical exegesis, but a kind of sermon or homily on the meaning of Job. I have always found the story of Job problematic and troubling, and McKibben's piece is one of the few I've read that puts the story in a context that makes sense, while avoiding the conclusion that God is simply unjust and capricious. It is a story about being humble in the face of Creation.Many fundamentalist Christians have the mistaken impression that there is some fundamental conflict between the Bible and care for the environment. The Old Testament talks more unabashedly about nature and stewardship than the New Testament, which is more human-centric, but in neither one will one find any equation of care for the environment with paganism. It is simply a matter of keeping straight whether you are worshiping the Creator through his creation (Nature) as opposed to worshiping nature itself. It is also a matter of retaining humility in the face of things that are beyond our understanding. The Universe is a very big place indeed, and we only have a small glimpse behind the curtain. McKibben's take on Job brings out this latter aspect beautifully."},{"Title":"The Comforting Whirlwind: God, Job, and the Scale of Creation","review":"This book is a remarkably fresh and insightful take on the lessons that can be drawn from the Bible about man's relation to nature.

After Robert is imprisoned by the Germans, Margaret must cope with life in Occupied France, care for their infant daughter, and work to obtain Robert's release. Before America enters the war, Margaret is officially \\"neutral\\" and relatively well-treated by the Germans. After America declares war on Germany, Margaret is desperate to escape France to avoid being interned by the Germans. How she escapes with her daughter is the crux of the story.This book is a must-read for WWII buffs and those interested in womens' history. Margaret wrote her story after she and her daughter reached New York and safety, escaping Europe under the noses of the Germans with the unexpected help of many people, including hiking out in the snow over the Pyrenees with a 3-year-old in tow.

At the end, it becomes too dangerous for her, an American, to contain living in France with her young daughter, and they must escape over the Pyrenees, helped by Basque freedom fighters, to reach the Spanish border. This book captured my imagination first when I was about twelve years old and, ever since that time, I have wondered: Did Robert, Vail's husband, return from Germany?

The Beauville brothers are left with a list by their sadistic father. From it they must choose wives and stay married to them for three years or lose a mega million dollar inheritance. The list and the selection process alone is enough plot for an entire story but is just the beginning of a long-ago and modern-day saga of a very disturbed family and the people who find themselves close enough to be touched by the tragedy.Twists and turns, plots and subplots tell the story of the people joined by this list, their motivations and eventually each of their salvation. Murder, mystery and history make this a story hard to put down. Ms. Flinn skillfully leads the reader to the point where the pieces seem to fall into place only to be drawn deeper into another layer of intrigue. She does a wonderful job of laying the groundwork of the family's cursed beginnings through the historical reality of black slave owners and the world of blacks who pass for white. The added element of magic made the story even more appealing.

After Pierre's death his sons expected to inherit his fortune, and they would but it would not be easy.There are four Beauville sons:Francois, Gerard, Rene and Leonard. Their father's will had very specific stipulations. These stipulations were: all of the sons had to be married by the time the youngest son, Leonard turned 21. They had to marry a woman who was on the list that was created when they were children. And the weddings had to be in the family wedding chapel and there could be no guests. The women's parents were paid a lump sum of money so that their daughters would marry Beauville men. Each son would inherit over 20 million dollars as long as they remained married for 3 years.The women chosen from the list are: Yvette Collins, a smart headstrong attorney, she will marry Gerard. Shell Davis a shy, timid young woman with a secret, she will marry Rene. Tammy Duyden the towns school teacher will marry Francois. Each of these women have their own reasons for marrying one of the Beauville sons.

Ely is responsible for the deaths of his owner's sons and escapes the plantation and lives as a white man. Ely then returns to the plantation after making a fortune and buys the plantation from the owner who is unaware of whom he is and Ely frees the slaves of the plantation, making them free townspeople. The Beauville curse is started when Ely marries the former owner's daughter who is his half sister.The List, debut novel from Patti Flinn is laced with suspense, intrigue and small town rife. Beginning with the prologue, the reader is kept spellbound by the events that occur. She first introduces us to the scene at the Beauville Estate. This scene is the official engagement party for the Beauville men. Three of the participants are outside and they are very angry. The argument leads one of the participants to lose their cool and a terrible accident occurs. This scene is the beginning of the best suspense novel I have ever read. Pierre Beauville, deceased patriarch of the Beauville family was everything that is evil.Pierre had four sons whom he hated with a passion. He abused his sons mentally, physically and emotionally and controlled every aspect of their lives. He ruled his family with an iron fist. Remember, Pierre is a descendent of Ely Beauville. Pierre found a way to continue his control over his sons' lives from the grave. His last will and testament contained a list that specified the names of women who he chose for his sons to marry. His sons would inherit one hundred million dollars, but their only choice was the women whose names appeared on The List. The will also stipulated that the sons must marry before the youngest son turned twenty-one and remain married for three years. The Beauville family has been plagued with one curse after another but they have continued to prosper. So they really believe that an arranged marriage will work. The Beauvilles are suddenly slapped with another curse and their world comes tumbling down.The main characters in this novel are the four Beauville men and the women they marry. The characters have their own problems and history. There comes the time for healing and each one somehow finds their way to a different life. One person holds the truth and this is what sets them free. Flinn has created a novel of intense suspense. The storyline is not clear in the beginning but slowly moves into one of the most suspenseful novels you may ever read. Her description of each character is awesome and makes you believe that these are people you know. The plot is awesome and the ending is unbelievable. I have never read a novel with so much suspense! The storyline is like no other that I have read. If you want to read a good suspense novel read The List.Reviewed by Dot"},{"Title":"The List","review":"Imagine opening the pages of a book and being instantly transported to the small southern town of Sugartree. A town steeped in the traditions of yesteryear. A town whose pacing, ideals, and mindsets have not changed over the last one hundred years. Untouched by progress, Sugartree is no stranger to the invisible caste system that separates the arrogance of the wealthy from its hapless victims who are forced to do their bidding.Enter the Beauvilles, four sons of an eccentric millionaire whose controlling nature reaches beyond the grave to direct a future that he cannot attend. The terms of Pierre Beauville's will can be construed as the machinations of a sick, twisted, demented mind, depending on your point of view, but it is also ironclad and legally binding.In order to secure their thirty million dollar inheritance each son must marry a woman whose name is on the list one month after the youngest son's twenty first birthday. In addition the marriage must last a minimum of three years to fulfill Pierre's bizarre contractual stipulations.The promise of such a bounty is not the only reason for acquiescing to Pierre's indomitable will. For Shell Davis, it is her ticket to legitimacy as an unwed soon-to-be-mother. Backwoods Tammy Duyden will earn the respectability that her teaching profession cannot give her. Another casualty of being born on the wrong side of Sugartree, Yvette Collins will earn the status of becoming a much feared and respected Beauville. While Dominique Poussant, the only legitimate contender to the throne will be getting what has always been expected of someone of her own means and stature within the community.All that glitters is not gold. When all of the &quot;contracts&quot; have been signed and the pre-ordained ceremonies take place, secrets from the past rise up to threaten not only their new lives together as husbands and wives, but their previously taken for granted sanity is also at risk of being extinguished.Small town gossip, fear and loathing, curses on the estate and its inhabitants are just a few of the calamities that befall those who are willing to profane the sanctity of marriage for the price of a king's ransom. The only question left to be answered in the end is, will it be worth it?Patti Flinn's debut novel sets her firmly on the path to literary greatness. Filled with suspense, murder, and mayhem, &quot;The List&quot; boldly announces Patti Flinn as a writer for the new millennium.Rosalind Stormer, author of &quot;Healing The Breach&quot;Flavah Reviewers"},{"Title":"The List","review":"This book had my attention from begining to end!

Probably a lot of your favorites came out after this book was published. However the movies in the book are worth scrutinizing as a part of \\"The New German Cinema\\"From the back cover:In this, the first book to examine the New German Cinema as a whole, John Sandford provides a film-by film study of these seven directors [Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, Hans-Jurgen Syberberg, Jean-Marie Straub, Alexander Kluge, and Volker Schlondorff], locating their achievements within a frame of developments in television, drama, documentaries, and the political history of contemporary Germany itself.What drew my attention to this book was the picture of Klaus Kinski from \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" (1972)and there is a great section on this film in the book.Aguirre, the Wrath of God"},{"Title":"Insights to Performance Excellence 2005: An Inside Look at the 2005 Baldrige Award Criteria","review":"In almost all cases, \\"quality managers\\" tend to be lousy managers themselves. If they had the innate qualities to be effective managers, they would quickly recognize \\"quality management\\" schemes as gimmicks that get in the way of serious management.In his foreword to Dr. Mark Blazey's Insights to Performance Excellence 2005, retired Xerox Vice President of Quality, John Lawrence acknowledges Blazey's assistance stating, \\"Dr. Mark Blazey...provided extremely valuable insight...to help us at Xerox develop world-class management systems that led to Xerox Business Services being recognized as a 1997 recipient of the Baldrige award.\\"One would expect, of course, to find a corresponding trend in Xerox's financial performance. Using Xerox's stock performance as a measure of financial success, one finds that Xerox stock rose from approximately $20 in 1996 to approximately $60 by 1998. This tripling of stock value would seem to validate Xerox's Baldrige effort. However, if one traces the trend backward one finds that the trend began in 1991 and moved upward with remarkable continuity to the middle of 1999. Assuming that Xerox's Baldrige efforts began in early 1995, and that the \\"process improvements\\" derived from Baldrige were fully implemented by the end of 1997, one would expect to see a steeper rise in stock performance somewhere after 1996. There is, in fact, nothing in the stock value trend that validates Xerox's commitment to Baldrige. In fact, from mid 1999 to the end of 2000, Xerox stock tumbled from over $60 to roughly $5 a share. Noting that the copy/printer industry kept zooming along during that period, whatever the cause of Xerox's downturn, it is obvious that the magic of Baldrige didn't work for Xerox. The fact is that Xerox's Leadership made bad business decisions and failed to recognize where the market was going. The precise point is that management \\"systems\\" like Baldrige are not magical formulas for producing good fundamental \\"strategic\\" business decisions.Equally surprising, considering Baldrige's emphasis on \\"governance\\", is that Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) gave Xerox a low rating in 1999, predicting that Xerox was headed for disaster. ISS is one of several organizations that rate the performance of corporate boards and CEOs. That Xerox's \\"governance\\" problems were that evident a little over a year after Xerox won the Baldrige award ought to be astounding to Baldrige believers. Moreover, that, in 2005, Baldrige guru Mark Blazey uses Xerox to market his Baldrige book tells us that Blazey, after all, wants to sell us something.Another apparently significant example cited in Lawrence's foreword, in the category of customer service, describes a scenario at Ritz-Carlton where the child of a hotel guest left a teddy bear on the floor by the bed. Lawrence relates that, \\"Upon return, the child found the teddy bear sitting at a small table with the Ritz Lion having tea.\\" It's a nice story. It just isn't relevant to 99% of the hotel industry. In fact, it really isn't much more than one would expect in an exclusive and very expensive hotel, and it is, after all, the sort of thing that happens within a very narrow range of employee discretion. Nor is there anything in Baldrige that would have generated such a cute customer service idea. So how does the example validate Baldrige? It doesn't. It's just a cute story woven into a sales pitch for Blazey's book.There's nothing wrong with the basic principles of Baldrige. In fact, if you're an effective manager, you probably apply them intuitively. The problem with the Baldrige \\"system\\", aside from its ineffectiveness, is that it is essentially incomprehensible and expensive to deploy. As an indication of its bewildering complexity, Blazey phone-book-sized tomb provides an 11 page glossary and an additional 2 pages \\"Clarifying Confusing Terms\\". The \\"quality champions\\" like Blazey who push Baldrige (and similar systems) will inevitably tell you, \\"It's a great system, if you can get people to understand it and apply it.\\" It is, in the final analysis, the comprehensibility of Baldrige that makes it seem so magical and keeps wizards like Blazey in business."},{"Title":"The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks","review":"Samuel Marchbanks is a grouchy old newspaperman who struggles with his coal furnace, garden, and neighbours in an attempt to live life as he feels is proper. He is witty, open-minded, well-read, and likes to shock his acquaintances.The Diary is a record of his day-to-day life over a year, with several amusing plot-lines running through it. The Table Talk is just that--a collection of Marchbanks' favourite prandial conversations (or monologues as the case may be). The Miscellanea are letters and various papers, as well as an interview of Marchbanks by Davies.This is an extremely funny collection of fiction. Although knowledge of early twentieth-century Canadian life helps, it's not necessary."},{"Title":"The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks","review":"Humor has moved to tv/movies. There are very few really funny writers around. Robertson Davies is a gem, all the rarer for being in such sparse company. This book has at least two or three laughs per page. It is a compendium of miscelleanous writing by one Samuel Marchbanks (Davies' alter ego) who keeps diaries and writes columns. I find myself giggling on my way to work on the subway as I race through these short aphoristic pieces. Highly recommend for any scrooges who refer to babies in terms appropriate for judging a ham and can stand dogs only in newspaper reports about their valorous deeds."},{"Title":"The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks","review":"It started innocently: a friend recommended Davies so I began with his first trilogy. Now I'm an addict, first gobbling up his fiction and then moving on to his non-fiction. The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks is Davies second or third publication of a collection of very short -- mostly one paragraph -- musings of his alter ego, the eccentric, out-spoken, crypto-curmudgeion, Samuel Marchbanks. These were first published individually as regular additions to the paper Davies edited in the '40s and '50s. This edition contains additional notes by Davies that explain references to people or events that may be unknown to younger generations. Davies' notes are often sly.Marchbanks is definitely not for everyone. If you haven't read enough Davies before you attempt this collection, you might very well stop reading in disgust at some of the silly items, or perhaps misunderstand the intent of the items. For example, some of them suggest that Davies has been annoyed by some human stupidity and chooses an oblique way of showing his disgust by having Marchbanks exaggerate a similar situation. Only a complete faith in Davies kept me reading beyond the first few pages. (So very glad I did!)Throughout the book character-types are introduced as letter-writers to Marchbanks; these characters reappear at intervals, building a continuing story of their foibles. Marchbanks, too, writes letters, mostly to his lawyers or government officials. E.g., Davies resentment of Canadian taxes is illustrated through Marchbanks' letters to \\"Haubergeon Hydra\\", Davies representative civil servant.Throughout the collection you'll find sarcasm, whimsey, cynicism, thinly-disguised anger and pure nonsense (viz., Chief Thunderbelly, the indigent Caucasian who passes himself off as a native American). Perhaps one has to be a bit of a cynic to enjoy Marchbanks; it certainly isn't a good introductory book to Davies. As for me, I've been wallowing in the book."},{"Title":"The watchers of the plains: A tale of the western prairies,","review":"This is a very well written book and is easy to read and follow the story line.

The story is well read with varied voices for each character. The narrator can go a tad slow at points, but it's much faster than a \\"popcorn read,\\" and it saves your voice if you have multiple sections (I have 4 of Freshman English) to read to.Why is this better on audio CD?1. Compatibility Issues: I bought \\"The Hobbit\\" on iTunes after my iPad refused to play certain chapters over my iTunes Match from my computer. I find this rather suspicious considering that my MacBook Pro had no problem playing the burned copy of my CD before.2. Mp4 Recording: It's split into \\"two books\\" meaning that each book is somewhere between five and 6 hours long. No 3-5 minute snippets like the CD's have which make it super easy to start and stop for classroom readings.3. iTunes Player stinks: You cannot easily start and stop from a specific second of the recording. Instead it jumps about a minute and a half at a time. Good luck starting at a specific paragraph if you accidentally bump a key. It won't happen.If you have the audio CD, you can play this from a CD player, or burn it to a computer and choose a variety of digital players to use. iTunes works just fine so long as you're dealing with the 5 minute long clips as opposed to their 5 hour long clips.If you're brave, you can also loan this out to other students or perhaps a new teacher."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read this book years ago, but never bought a copy for myself.

Then, a thunderstorm came upon them and they found a dry cave and slept there for the night. Bilbo was awakened by a scraping sound, then he saw the stone wall open.

Then Thorin stepped forward and explained to him that they did not mean to trespass. Gandolf appeared at the door and freed the group from the goblins.

I never heard the thing without skipping first parts of the chapters that weren't as important. Last year, in fourth grade, I read the book for a report and loved it even more than before. I am on chapter seven again. The book is about a hobbit who is asked by a wizard and thirteen dwarves to go on an adventure with them to reclaim a lost treasure stolen by the evil dragon Smaug. It takes a lot of courage and adventure to go on the journey to get to the mountain that Smaug lives in and the crew of thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and a wizard have to brave. They eventually get there, though. You should definetly read this wonderful, exiting book if your are a person who loves adventure, excitment, and just plain great writing.

Tolkien has the imagination of a 3rd grader, and puts his skills to the paper in one of the best books ever written. Although written decades ago, the fantasy novel still intrigues readers of all kinds. The Hobbit could very well be read by the average middle school student, but also enjoyed by the grown-up that whishes to be once again like a middle school student. Tolkien takes you through the world of Middle-Earth on a journey where no hobbit would normally venture. It is a trek that you will not forget. And like many others, they have taken the trek over and over and over again(you will probably end up reading The Hobbit again and again)."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" when I was in 7th grade, it was required reading. The difference between it and other required readings for school was that I couldn't wait to finish this book. I constantly read ahead. Now after seeing \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" I decided that I would read \\"The Hobbit\\" again. It proved to be twice as good the second time around. There were many parts of the book which I had forgotten about, and there were also many parts of the book which helped explain the movie. It is a quick read (I finished in about 3 days), very exciting, and an action packed book. I would recommend that anyone interested in reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" start with this book first.

If you do not like it then you should probably not waste your time with the rest of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Hobbits are little creatures, only about half your height. They have no need for shoes, because lots of hair grow on their little feet and leathery soles, and they can creep around very quietly without a noise. One particular hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is an ordinary hobbit that lives in a large hobbit-hole in The Hill, and never thought he would have an adventure or wanted one until one beautifully sunny day in April. On this day, while sitting outside, there stood the great wizard, Gandalf! They planned tea for the next day, and before poor Bilbo knew it, there were thirteen dwarfs (not including Gandalf and Bilbo)! Bilbo was so surprised and busy (preparing more tea and food for the dwarfs) that he did not remember that it was his fiftieth birthday the next day. On the day of his birthday, Gandalf and the dwarfs, Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bomber, and Thorin, took him on a quest to retrieve the treasure that the evil dragon, Smaug had stolen. It was a very hard trip there, with little and sometimes no food, lots of horrible situations and enemies including some giant spiders, goblins, wolves, and trolls. In one occurrence, Bilbo finds a golden rings and figures out that it can make him invisible and he uses it to try to escape from many bad situations.This magical fantasy masterpiece is sure to capture your heart and live in your imagination forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a delightful story with much adventure and drama.

It tells of their adventures against the giant spiders, evil wolves, orcs and much, much more. Even though he first wishes that he was home by his warm fire and on his soft bed, this adventure changes his life and the lives of his companions.

This story is a masterpiece in itself. Second best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Like many people, I list \\"The Hobbit\\" as one of my childhood classics. Now those favorites from my younger days are curious things. As a child, they never seemed to grow old or stale. I read this book and several others until my copies were ready to fall apart. But upon rereading them as an adult, some of them have proven to be disappointing. Which isn't to say that books like The Chronicles of Narnia or \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" are bad, but they don't carry as much emotional punch as they could and seem a little tedious in retrospect.Not so with \\"The Hobbit\\". Having recently read it for the first time in more than ten years, I can say that this book is every bit as exciting and imaginative from an adult perspective as from a child's. It is amazing. It approaches perfection in so many areas that it daunts the imagination. For instance, consider how much Tolkien is able to accomplish in just the first chapters. He introduces all the important characters and gives them distinctive personalities, builds sympathy for the hero, provides all the necessary backstory, injects a little humor, and prepares you for the epic adventure ahead.And what an adventure it is! I marveled at Tolkien's amazing skill in so many areas. His action sequences are fast, short, and easy to visualize. His songs and poetry add a wonderfully quaint touch to the story. His simple descriptive writing paints perfect portraits of landscapes in just a few sentences. There is literally nothing done wrong in this story. The current crop of fantasy authors would do well to pause from their latest eight-hundred page extravaganza and remind themselves that Tolkien never repeated himself or included anything unnecessary. His goal was to write small and speedy, to always be providing something new for the reader.A note about the illustrations: some of the editions that they're hawking now include copies of the pen and ink drawings that Tolkien did for the first edition. Like many people, I was raised with the 1966 paperback that didn't include the illustrations. It's an unfortunate fact that Tolkien's skill as an artist didn't come close to matching his skill as a writer. Some of the drawings are decent, but others are almost laughably bad. I would recommend trying to find a copy without the illustrations."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Bilbo Baggins is the name of the Hobbit living in the Shire when one day a wizard appears and changes his life. He is invited to share with them a journey as a burglar. At first Bilbo turns him down but soon 13 dwarves are in his house and convince him to reconsider. He decides to go with them and hurries to meet up with them. The party's goal is to journey to the Lonely Mountains to retain a treasure stolen from their ancestor from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they are attacked by various fairy tale creatures and meet a creature named Gollum. Scared by Gollum's odd ways and trickery, Bilbo uses the ring that he has stumbled upon in the tunnels. Gollum goes crazy and tries to get him but Bilbo narrowly escapes. The journey goes on and things change for Bilbo and he returns to his hobbit-hole a totally different person.

Only Bilbo, Gandalf, and Gollum shine. This, however, is still workable. With Thorin as a distinct personality among the Dwarves, the others function all right as a group with whom Bilbo doesn't really interact on a personal level.A much more serious problem exists in the Hobbit - the mid-book action is too good! \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" makes such a memorable literary impression that following adventures, even if good, would pale. Worse, after Mirkwood, the book just peters out. The interview with Smaug stands out in an island of otherwise mediocre action. The Battle of Five Armies is almost skipped, definitely lacking the emotion of meeting the Goblins in the Misty Mountains. Bilbo's stealthy dealing with the Arkenstone adds some interest, but the end of this otherwise marvelous book just falls down.But don't mistake criticism for dislike. Even recognizing this, the Hobbit stands as an adventure akin to Treasure Island or the Wind in the Willows. The stay-at-home off to a grand quest makes for a wonderful beginning, the Trolls are fine, the eagles soar, Beorn is intriguing, and Mirkwood is haunting. The child who misses the experience of the Hobbit must face the only remedy - he or she must read it as an adult!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are truly fans of fantasy books. Tolkein does a very well at describing the adventure of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books.

They bring the hobbit on a long journey to defeat Smaug, a dragon that sleeps on gold and jewels. this book is action packed right from the thrid or so chapter.

This book will keep you reading all the way through, the ending is awesome by the way, and Gandalf plays almost no part in the book but does in the other books from the series.

Gandalf had come to Bilbo's door with all the dwarves because he had an adventure, or rather a quest for little bilbo baggins. One of the dwarves was related to a king that ruled a moutain. He had many riches and he treasured them so much that he filled the tunnels in the mountain with the treasure. One day a huge dragon invaded the mountain and horded all the gold and had been guarding it to the present day that Gandalf went to Bag End to Bilbo's little hobbit home.

Tolkien's 1937 novel, \\"The Hobbit: or There and Back Again\\" is the starting point for what became \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is a whimsical adventure, introducing us to hobbits, dwarves, elves, dragons, and a host of other fantastic creatures. However, this is not just a tale of quest-adventure, or a simple morality play. Tolkien's own introduction to the first edition notes the \\"glimpses into the history and politics\\" of Bilbo's world that the novel provides. Indeed, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a journey from innocence to experience, but the lessons learned are fraught with contradictions and complicated political messages.\\"The Hobbit\\" begins abruptly, as Bilbo Baggins, a 50 year old hobbit, living a comfortable, sedate life, is intruded upon by the wizard Gandalf and a company of 13 dwarves. Against his better judgement, Bilbo is swept into accompanying this band in a quest to recover the treasure and birthright of Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarf leader. For countless years, the Lonely Mountain, ancestral home of Thorin's people, has been inhabited by the powerful usurping dragon, Smaug. At Gandalf's insistence, the dwarves, believing Bilbo to be an accomplished burglar, recruit the hobbit to assist their quest. The quest, which takes the adventurers halfway across their world, is beset by trials and tribulations, as they must face dangerous goblins, spiders, the dragon, and the commercial civilization of Men. These are trials of mental and physical strength, and they test the dwarves, but more importantly, Bilbo. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum and the adventure of the Ring is the centerpiece of the novel. Bilbo's characterization as a burglar by Gandalf and the dwarves at the novel's beginning casts a shadow over the ethical decisions Bilbo is faced with throughout the rest of the tale.There are many points of interest in a novel like this, which could be seen as a fairly straightforward Marxist fable. Tolkien's distrust of money as a locus of desire is most apparent in the development of Thorin's character, but also in his anxiety over the Master of Lake-Town, and in the fat and complacent Smaug, whose flesh has become embedded with jewels from ages of sitting atop his treasure hoard. Contrasting this with Bilbo, whose primary interest is in food and good cheer, is problematic. His experiences with Gollum and the Ring and his later relationship with Thorin call into serious question Bilbo's own priorities. In fact, one of the things that is so amazing about \\"The Hobbit\\" is that there seems to be no one character that represents the center of morality in a novel so concerned with honorable action and fair dealing.The action of \\"The Hobbit\\" is fast-paced, and Tolkien for the most part is content to sacrifice character development to plot. That said, the most interesting characters in the novel for me were Gandalf, Bilbo, the \\"skin-changer\\" Beorn, and Thorin. They provide a complicated variety of perspectives on inter-cultural relations and politics, value systems, and justice. Tolkien's achievement in \\"The Hobbit\\" is the way that he disguises what is problematic in the society he presents in what appears to be, and is at heart, a fun and enjoyable adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The hobbit is about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A hobbit is a little person that lives in the land of Shire. It all starts with Bilbo Baggins, not found of adventures at all! He just likes to live in the comfort of his little hobbit hole. Then along comes thirteen dwarfs accompanied by a wizard named Gandalf. They come to him with a quest. A quest to get their town and treasure back from a dragon named Smaug. They just need one more person for their journey. That person is to be a burglar, and you guessed it, that burglar is Bilbo Baggins! The hobbit goes through many fasinating adventures in this book that are mind-popping and so enjoyable to read. Read the hobbit to find out about the adventures of Bilbo Baggins!Boy, I sure loved this prelude to the Lord of the Rings! It is so fascinating to read about the adventures Bilbo gets into as the book gets nearer and nearer to the end! If you read this and love it like I do, then I suggest you start reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But, read The Hobbit first! In this book, Bilbo finds a ring that somehow makes him invisible. But that's not all the ring does or creates! there is an evil master to that ring and put the two together, well Houston we got a problem! Frodo, Bilbo's cousin by blood, but now his adopted son because Frodo's parents died in a boating accident has a quest to distroy that awful ring in the fires of Mordor.Read the Lord of the Rings trilogy for more fantasy adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I recently read the &quot;Hobbit&quot; so that I could then move onto &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and then go see &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movies.I have never read Fantasy books before so this was my first one, and I have to say that Fantasy takes some getting used to.While I enjoyed &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, I did find some parts of it slow and uninteresting.

The story is as rich in detail and plot as the LOTR pseudo-trilogy, if not more so, with the added bonus of actual characterization for many of the characters.

Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself. I thank you for taking the time to read my request and I hope you consider the opportunities available for success."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I am so glad I finally got around to reading this.

The dwarves are starting a quest to reclaim their lost home and gold from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo loves his home and his simple life, but he finds his Tookish side forcing him in.I was extremely happy with The Hobbit. I thought it was masterfully told, and I enjoyed Tolkien's style. I particular like how he is very straightforward, and doesn't force the reader to feel emotion. Instead, he presents the plot and allows the readers to feel on their own. I was often surprised by how casually a death or important, emotional event was told.My only criticism of the book would be that there are too many characters. The 13 dwarves are named Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Ori, and Thorin. Although the names are rather amusing, it is often hard to remember who is who. Having all of the names (except Thorin) very similar to at least one other name can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is very amusing, and it can help you remember their relationships, such as Fili and Kili being brothers. It can also make you feel like you know all of them when you really don't. On the other hand, it can be confusing at times and it can distort your perception of how many people are in the party.In conclusion, I was extremely happy with The Hobbit, and would highly recommend it. I loved the story, how it was told, and the themes present in it. Although I thought there were some issues with the characters, it was a very impressive read.

One morning after a hearty breakfast, the wizard Gandalf arrives, and that's when the trouble begins. Gandalf ends up inviting a flummoxing total of twelve dwarves over for tea the next day. The dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the glory and riches once held by their forefathers, but they need a \\"burglar\\" to help, and hobbits are small, stealthy creatures.Bilbo joins their party on a whim after being teased by the dwarves and praised by Gandalf for his yet-unknown abilities. He soon regrets his decision when the rolling fields past his home turn into a dark, foreign country, and he doubts that he has what it takes to carry out an adventure of this magnitude.As Bilbo meets (and is captured by) trolls, goblins, wolves, spiders, and wood-elves, he begins to use his practicality to his advantage; when engaged in riddles with Gollum under the mountain, for instance, his wit saves him from a very unfortunate end. And he puts his riddling skill to use with Smaug the Dragon as well, using their conversation as a chance to scope out the dragon's weakness.Happy scenes are interspersed throughout the tale to keep Bilbo from despairing entirely; they rest at the Last Homely House as the guest of a friendly elf, the noble eagles of the mountain come to their rescue more than once; they find a faithful friend in Beorn, who is usually gruff and wary of visitors; and the men of Lake-town herald their arrival to oust Smaug the Dragon from the dwarves' ancestral mountain.But more often than not--and certainly more than he would like!--it is small, hearth-loving Bilbo who ends up saving the day, when he and his friends are faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Bilbo grows from a homebody to a hero with \\"a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck.\\"AnalysisThe Hobbit is one of the best books I've read all year.I know. I know!

Where I got this idea, I don't know--possibly from my brothers' fantastical explanations of Tolkien's books, which sounded far too removed from me to be interesting.As it turns out, The Hobbit is so widely regarded by readers of all stripes because of its humanity, its down-to-earth humor, and its realism. Who would've thought? (Everyone but me, I suppose.)As Michael D.C. Drout explains in The Modern Scholar: Rings, Swords, and Monsters: Exploring Fantasy Literature, applying Marxist theory to the story helps to understand its appeal: Bilbo represents the bourgeoisie, the trolls are members of the Cockney-accented working class, and Smaug the Dragon is the ruling class, literally rolling in riches. Tolkien himself was certainly no stranger to literature and theory, with a history of Anglo-Saxon epic poem translation under his belt. He incorporates themes common to Middle Age conquests while also sprinkling the book with a healthy dose of modern-day humor.Bilbo is an unexpected hero, the everyman who saves the day more than once. Though often he seems primarily occupied with eating breakfast, maintaining a tidy appearance, and yearning for his soft bed far from these dangerous adventures, he keeps a cool head when he and the dwarves seemed faced with certain doom. In fact, Bilbo's practical considerations are often what save them; while the dwarves stubbornly refuse to tell the Elf-King the purpose of their quest, which leads to their imprisonment, Bilbo cleverly rescues them, though his unorthodox methods produce more than a few grumbles among the dwarves.Bilbo is an incredibly likeable character with whom I can closely identify; who doesn't love a second breakfast? On a deeper level, Bilbo's moral ambiguity makes him a realistic hero; when he is bargaining with the men and the elves that are preparing to battle against the dwarves, who have become offensively greedy, he begins by complaining that the entire matter has made him uncomfortable and cranky, and he offers goods stolen from the dwarves to appease the other side.The Hobbit originated as a story Tolkien told his children, and the excellent narrative style and the thrilling twists and turns took me back to the days when my parents would read me bedtime stories. I felt like running from the hulking, humped figures of the goblins, and I shivered at the enormous hairy spiders of Milkwood Forest.Because of its intensely imaginative plot and Tolkien's masterful literary execution, The Hobbit is one of those few books that are equally attractive to kids and adults alike. But you probably already knew that!For more reviews like this one, please visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My son(9) received this as a gift from my best friend when he starred as Bilbo (the hobbit) in a dramatic version of this book. All the cast signed it. It is a beautifully bound copy of \\"The Hobbit\\" - a real keepsake. My son proceeded to read the book over the summer. He really enjoyed it. I recommend this book to \\"kids\\" of all ages, especially boys. I recommend this edition to anyone wanting a special copy of this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I hadn't read the Hobbit since sometime in the mid 80's. After watching the Peter Jackson LOTR films, and reading news about Guilermo Del Toro filming the Hobbit I felt the need to re connect with Mr Baggins. I picked up THIS version of a beloved classic. I should mention, that to re read the Hobbit I bought THIS version, leaving my old paperback on the shelf in the closet. This book is simply a treasure, and easily is the perfect adventure story. This is the reason why I wanted to read this anniversary edition of the story, I thought it deserved special attention.The story is great adventure, with Tolkiens ideas layed out in fantastic detail. There are parts of this book, that made me laugh out loud (such as when the Dwarfs yell out at giants playing 'ball' by throwing rocks back and forth during a thunderstorm) and tender moments such as (when Bilbo takes a final look at the lonely mountain to say farewell to the final resting place of three of the dwarfs ) this also marks the end of Bilbo's adventure.Other fantasy characters seemed influenced by Tolkiens writings. Beorn who is a shape shifting wood dweller, more than reminds me of Hagrid from Harry Potter. Hagrid size and nature of how he lives is very similar to Beorn. I cant go on about alot of things in The Hobbit, this review could be as long as the book.Anyway I give the highest recommendation to The Hobbit. A great story by a great writer. Sit down and enjoy the writing of a brilliant author, and illustrator."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've read quite a few reviews here that seem to assume that you (the reader), are well versed in the Lord of the Rings series.Simply put, this book, when compaired to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, almost seem like they were written by two entirely different authors. Perhaps that's why this book is one of my favorites.The Hobbit is a children/young adult novel telling the tale of a small, unlikely hero named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo, known as a \\"Hobbit\\", is elected to play the role of burgler and help a hand full of bearded dwarves reclaim there stolen treasure from the dreaded dragon, Smaug.There are a few things to keep in mind. For one, this book was written well over half a centry ago. The english language has changed a bit over the ages it seems, and perhaps the age range it had been intended for then, will have a little trouble getting through it in our day and age.The second, as mentioned above, is that this book is not wholy in the theme of the Lord of the Rings trilogies. The narration is much more light hearted, even humerous at times. Personally, I argue that this is where the Lord of the Rings failed, with its dry, history text like narration. With the Hobbit, we get the feel of sitting around an old arm chair, while Old man Tolkien gets into his adventure, playing out the roles of the characters, and making the sound effects himself. Simply put... it \\"READS\\" a lot more fun.The Hobbit is also a little different from the Lord of the Rings as it takes the world around it at face value. A few things are explained in great detail, while most of the world at large is only breifly explained. Some people would prefer a greater detail into the world that Tolkien has created. Not all people, however, want a 4 page description on ever characters lineage, or every cities history. For those people, good new, tolkien has a near unlimited amount of text on his invention. For every one else, this book flows a little smoother than some of his other works.I will say that a lot of new readers are turned off by the first chapter. There is a lot of exposition, and it containt a lot of information that won't really make sense to new tolkien readers. My advice, is to push through. The book really picks up, and is one of the most magical, wonderful reads you'll ever get through."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In case this review gets listed for other editions (which sometimes happens) the aisn of the book I am reviewing is 0395177111.This book has a sturdy dark green slipcase with a stylized illustration on the front that looks like one of Tolkien's own drawings of a mountain in the background of a forest. The book cover is slightly fancier than the slipcase and has red and gold letters/language symbols surrounding the illustration repeated from the slipcase. The spine also has beautiful lettering. The book is very substantial and large (1.5 x 7 x 9.5). The text is not too small. The edges of the pages are a mottled green and white color. The book include maps in both front and back, front is a journey/adventure map, back is a geographic map. This is a lovely addition to my Tolkien collection and I am thrilled to have it. The red collectible The Lord of the Rings book is a nice companion to this."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is not a literary review, this is about the edition/printing only.This is a great paperback. I bought it because it was economical, but ended up enjoying it because it is of exceptional quality. This is NOT a mass-market, stiff as a board, tiny font, drug-store printing. This is a book with sturdy binding and thick matte paper with pleasantly large font type. While it doesn't lay flat on a table when open, it is very easy to hold open in one hand. I love hardbacks, but this paperback was a purchase I do not regret.GREAT BOOK, MEMORABLE JOURNEY WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERS, AND A TOTALLY RECOMMENDED EDITION."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit by Tolkien is most definitely one of the best books ever. My Dad first read it to me when I was probably only 7, and I know I will still love it when I'm 100.The edition itself is amazing. The illustrations are by Tolkien, as they should be. The best illustrations in any book are either by the author or by someone the author personally chooses, because the reader can be sure that everything is illustrated as the author imagined it. Many times when an author illustrates his own book, the art is not the best quality, but not in this case. Tolkien was a great and creative artist in addition to being one of the best authors of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Our 10 year old and 7 year old sons and their mum are really enjoying this recording every time we get in the car.

First I must say this: If you do not like this book you are one of two things, a person who had no childhood or you have totally no imagination. The Hobbit brings curiosity and wonder to our everyday boring live, to think that there might be a world where a kind of adventure or life forse like this does exsist is something to live for. To be a child and think about fairies, goblins,magic,and wizards bring curiostiy to the mind. This book helps you get away for life to a world of wonder and wizardry and brings the joy of being a child to my heart."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you want something to get involved in ((I mean really involved in))then you should definitly read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R.

It's an exciting adventure story with a bit of fantasy and magic all mixed into one. I think it is a most excellent story and would recomend it to anyone looking for a good Sunday sitting in the park doing nothing story. You may wonder why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 well to tell you the truth I thought the ending definatly could have been better. The entire story is based on a quest to rid an ancient dwarve fortress from SMAUG an evil dragon well it turns out that the adventures dont kill smaug and he plays a minor part in the long run. But aside from that I recommend it to fantasy/adventure lovers alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Cute. This is a simple child's tale that serves as a nice springboard to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. It stands by itself as a nice story, yet is good enough to make you rush for the real McCoy- the next three books. The fertility of Tolkien's mind is amazing, and the places and creatures described in the Hobbit are such that it would have taken scores of other writers several lifetimes to conceive of them. Bilbo Baggins and his company are loveable characters, and my only criticism of the tale is that they seem to escape every jam they find themselves in, to the point that you stopped wondering whether or not they would make it with each new challenge that presented itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago &amp; didn't enjoy it much. So I wasn't expecting to enjoy it the 2nd time as well, but 15 years can change a lot of your perceptions. The book was engaging and delightful.

I think I shall read Lord of the Rings now!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was a good book to me because i like different kinds of books that have DnD like material in them. This book will fasinate people to all ages that are ready to read a long yet good book. It starts out in a small community of hobbits in a place called Bag End where Bilbo Baggins and other hobbits live. One morning while bilbo was smoking his pipe and making smoke rings, a wizard or enchanter named Gandalf came and talked to Mr. Baggins. Later that night a company of 13 dwarves arrived and had a feast in Mr. Baggins house in honor of the band they made up to go steal back some treasure from abig mean dragon named Smaug. Smaug had stollen a sacred treasure from the dwarves long ago and Thorin, the leader of the dwarves wanted to get it back. Their quest was a dangerous one, they had to battle through ravaging orcs, quick wolves, dangerous spiders, and the powerful elves. They also met some friends along the way including a giant man who could change into a giant bear. I think the ending is really spectacular, but your going to read it for yourself. I hoped i have convinced you to buy the book and if i didnt there are plenty of other reviews that are better than mine.

On thier journey, many problems arise in which Bilbo proves his worth countless times. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially thoe who love fantasy books.

The main characters were believable and down to earth, yet the story itself was epic. As a stand alone story it is a wonderful read, but when combined with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it makes for what I consider to be one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time. I reread these stories at least every 2 years, and it never ceases to capture my interest and stimulate my imagination. If you've never read it, do so now. If you've tried it once and didn't like it, give it a try again. One thing this story requires is a little patience.

I don't suggest anyone reading this if you are under your teenage years. It is a very difficult book to read if you are young (that is why they have cliff-notes for it) So this is what I say, if you like Fantasy and you like Tolkien, buy it, if you don't like Fantasy and you think Tolkien is a terrible writer (which I do not agree with), then don't buy it.

Well than The Hobbit (by J.R.R. Tolkien) is just the book for you. The Hobbit takes place in a \\"Fantasy Land\\". It starts out in a hobbit hole and leads to different places (caves, caverns, towns and other mysterious locations). In case you didn't know, a hobbit is a small creature; smaller than your average dwarf. But unlike a dwarf, hobbits don't have beards. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit and also the main character in the book. One day Bilbo was quietly sitting alone at home, when he meets a wizard named Gandalf. There are dwarves that help them too. On their mysterious and dangerous journey they work together to vanquish Smaug, an evil dragon feared by the whole countryside. What'll happen to Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 dwarves when they encounter giant spiders and other creatures?The Hobbit is a great book because it talks about magic and journeys. J.R.R. Tolkien describes elves, dwarves, giant creatures, and best of all, \\"Hobbits\\"!! You should read this book because it's magical and mysterious. The author uses exquisite invisible rings. The sequel to this book might be better though. The Lord of the Rings has hobbits, giants, rings, and other journeys too.

This is one of my favorite books it ranks right up there with the books in the trilogy. Tolkien is a master of descriptive writing, but at times he gets almost too in depth and the story loses some of its edge and excitement hence the rating of 4.

With the immanent release of the movie version of 'Lord of the Rings' following the release of 'The Philosopher's Stone' I wondered if my son was ready for 'The Lord of the Rings'. I had read 'The Lord of the Rings' several times many years ago and my memory of it was that it was a bit gruelling for a young boy to appreciate. 'The Hobbit' seemed to be a more gentle approach to the mythology of Tolkien.I was also interested in how the older book compared with Harry Potter. I have no doubt that it is much superior despite the fact that some aspects of 'The Hobbit' have dated and are a bit local in their English feel. My son was quite engrossed and had no trouble refreshing the story each evening before we set off on a new chapter.We finished reading the novel at our holiday house by the beach over the Christmas break, and this meant that our younger son was exposed to the end of the story too (he's just 5). But he appreciated the story and both boys took to weaving Middle Earth stories about the adventures of their holiday.This is a great story for sharing."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the first fantasy book that I ever read. Some will call The Hobbit a children's book, and I suppose that it could be. But, at age 23, I really enjoyed it. Each chapter has it's own plot, complete with problem and resolution, and a hook at the end to keep you turning the pages. Although Tolkien has his long-winded moments in this book, as LOR readers should be familiar with, the plot is great. I have read The Fellowship of the Ring, and I (GASP!) think that this book is better, from the standpoint of not being bored with any of it. Of course, once you read it, you'll want to find out what happens next, and the LOR series will soon follow.I highly recommend this book.

The story begins with the introduction of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who enjoys his quiet life in Bag-End, but has his routine disturbed when his friend Gandalf decides that he needs a change. The poor hobbit soon finds his home filled with a party of dwarves and himself the thief of an expedition to reclaim stolen treasure from the terrible dragon, Smaug.The quest is very exciting, with several satisfying detours that foreshadow larger troubles brewing in Middle Earth. The environments and battles are all vividly described, making it easy for the reader to imagine that they are actually part of the fantastic band of adventurers. Because each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, there is lots of motivation to keep turning the pages, but even if a reader does take an extended break, they are never at a loss for what is happening.*MINOR SPOILERS IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH*The only shortcoming of the novel is that although the theme that even little people can end up doing important things, Bilbo does nothing in the final, climactic battle of the book (The Battle of Five Armies) other than run and hide, despite having strong allies, a powerful weapon, and some new tricks up his sleeve. While this is understandable, considering how small he is, it goes against the stronger, more clever character that he became over the duration of the book.*END OF SPOILERS*In conclusion, you should definitely pick up this book if you haven't already, especially to read the foundation of the upcoming movie. Despite the minor shortcoming mentioned earlier, the adventure is very absorbing and the situations the characters manage to get themselves into and out of are unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I loved The Hobbit with all of Bilbos adventures!!!!

Next time I'll order things from this vendor."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, like The Chronicles of Narnia, defines the standard for children's fantasy literature. Bilbo is one of the endearing hobbit-folk who populate Tolkien's imaginative world of Middle Earth. One day he is compelled by the wizard Gandalf to leave his comfortable home and set out with thirteen dwarves on quest whose ramifications he does not fully understand but in which he will play a crucial role as the group faces monstrous orcs, giant spiders, wolves, and worse, until finally Bilbo comes face to face with the dread dragon Smaug. Throughout his adventures, Bilbo's true character emerges and the reader comes to understand that underneath his soft exterior there is a steely center of courage and the will to do what is right.Tolkien's works have attained classic status through their excellent story quality, deeply coherent story world, and a perceptive eye toward human nature. Christian thinkers especially appreciate that Tolkien's stories, while not allegorical, are firmly rooted in a Christian view of the world.The Hobbit forms an important prelude to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but is written for a younger audience and is a better choice for reading aloud, since its prose is simpler and includes enjoyable repetitive elements in its storytelling style."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Funny, colorful, exciting story of someone who has an adventure and becomes all sorts of things he never expected to be--most of all a true leader."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This story has non stop action in every chapter.

I never give any plot \\"spoilers\\", I'll just say it's the introduction of the great character Bilbo Baggins, and he takes you on quite an adventure after a visit from Gandalf the Wizard. What I like is it's much easier to follow the story compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit has a more simple yet adventurous plot, but in many ways it's better than the other Tolken books, because in the Lord of the Rings trilogy that follows, there are so many places and names, it's easy to get tired of remembering everything (something that's less of a burden in the feature films too) you feel as though you have to take notes to keep along with the story, with The Hobbit, you won't feel it's unnecessarily convoluted with characters and places, and the novel is just as exciting as the others to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I found this book quite by accident, while being at the library looking for something completely different. Having heard of this book before, I read a few pages, and I started to get hooked. The book is about a little hobbit known as Bilbo Baggins and it follows his adventures around Tolkien's magical world. Gandalf and some dwarves head out to fight goblins, trolls, spiders, and many other creatures, all for a chance at untold riches. However the treasure is guarded by a cruel dragon known as Smaug. I enjoy Tolkien's writing style and I especially love his humor. This is probably one of the finest books he has written. It is a shame how you can hear the cash register ring as every subsequent book was written. The Hobbit is not the easiest read however, and Tolkien's colorful use of words can be hard to follow at times.

I first discovered it 20 years ago by mistake, and it has never left me. It sparked my love of reading and led to my choice of college degree. (In fact, I might never have gone to college if it weren't for my research of Tolkien and his time at Oxford as both student and professor. To be close to saints, one must walk in their footsteps!) But all of this is purely consequence. What about the story? Why does it affect people so strongly? To be honest, some don't get it. But most others do for the reason that The Hobbit answers a very deeply held longing in most of us to be part of a simpler time and to be part of a Quest, which is both a physical and spiritual journey, a testing of the soul, and a chance for heroism and the overthrow of Evil. The ethics of The Hobbit are those we would have operate in our own world. Through the main character, Bilbo Baggins, we are allowed to experience this romantic world where the underdog overcomes great difficulty to smite down the bad, raise up the good, and make life better place for all. Tolkien's use of language is also superb, relying heavily on Anglo-Saxon derived words which provides and emotional link between the book and reader. This is the language we first heard in the cradle and we still respond to it. The setting is also hidden deep in our sub-conscious, reflecting a simler time in our own world before electricity, gasoline, smog, television, skyscapers, overpopulation, crime, etc. -- all the suffocating and demoralizing debris of modern living. This reverence for the past played a large role in Tolkien's life. Out of that longing came his choice of schooling and profession and this book. We cannot escape it ourselves. Middle-earth is our world made perfect. There is no one who loves The Hobbit who wouldn't trade places with Bilbo Baggins or even, for just one day, take a long walk through the sunlit fields of the Shire. What a beautiful place to live.

Therefore, it's hard for me to think of The Hobbit without comparing and contrasting it to the trilogy. First off, The Hobbit bears all of Tolkien's genius: descriptive passages that are more like a painting than a paragraph, clever poetry and songs, and an imaginary world that has come to life with Tolkien's inventive language and culture of the characters. When one reads Tolkien, it's like reading about a real place. However, the one thing that I really did not like about \\"The Hobbit,\\" especially in comparison to LOTR, is that there is very little character development. I often had trouble keeping track of names because the characters just don't do much besides have adventures.

The reader is introduced to a full gamut of characters and beings that play critically important roles in subsequent books.I have no interest in summarizing the plot since any discussion along these lines would spoil the revelations to be discovered by new readers.This exceptional fantasy tale that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.

I read that one of the reasons J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the book was for his own children to enjoy, but the intended audience of this book could be anywhere from 13 up to adults, as I know a 30 year old who claims to have read it 5 times and as recently as last year. Because of how well the book was written and the great characters, this is a great book for someone of any age to read.The only background information you need to know about this book is that it is a prequel to the Lord of The Rings series. I do not have many criterions to judge this book as it is the first one I have ever read from cover to cover. To summarize the book, Bilbo is convinced to go with a large pack of Dwarves as a thief to help them get their mountain back from an evil dragon called Smaug. Along the way they run into trolls, elves, spiders, goblins, eagles, and participate in a huge battle.I really enjoyed all of the books key elements. The plot really worked well for someone my age, it had a great reward at the end of all their hard work, and it had some amazing characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. It had sad parts too at the end where a main character learned a good life lesson. Knowing that this book was wrote before the Lord of The Rings I think it sets up that book really well. It already lets you meet a few of the main characters and makes you interested to see what happens to Bilbo and his ring. I haven't read any other books like this so it makes it hard to compare to books like it, but I know that I would be interested in reading more books like it if there any.The great characters and the adventure in this book really have made it an enjoyment to read. From the very beginning of being introduced to Bilbo and all his adventures with trying to escape being eaten by trolls, trying to get out of a goblin cave, being chased by wolves and spiders, and helping the dwarves escape from an Elvish prison along with trying to defeat a dragon and survive a war I really had a great time reading it. While I expected this project to be no fun at all, the book was so great it has made this little project turn into its own huge adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book to my three sons and they in turn wanted their children to enjoy the same book.That's why I searched for this book long out of print."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the second time I've read The Hobbit.

With characters which are perfectly real and complex matched with the indepth world of Middle Earth which has languages, peoples, geography, and a true *feel* of its own, this story is amazing, and stands as my favorite novel, of course, next to The Lord of the Rings, which continues the plight of Bilbo's magical ring."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This was an incredble book.

I don't think there are very many books out there with the broad scope that The Hobbit has illustrated. The plot, characters, descriptions; they all come together to tell a remarkable story that has stood the test of time. This classic, along with The Trilogy (if you say The Trilogy, most sci-fi readers know you speak of The Lord of the Rings), continues to show its influences on popular science fantasy. I can't think of another series of books that have had such an impact on the world of science fantasy as these four. Even The Chronicles of Narnia come in second place.

I am fairly confident that this is the best edition ever printed. The actual book itself (without the dust cover) is clothbound in dark green and and has the title printed in gold on the spine. There is also a gold dragon outlined in gold on the bottom of the book (a really nice touch). It is very beautiful.The jacket is very beautiful as well. The jacket has gold everywhere and the golden color seems to catch and reflect light. The front cover has a picture of Smaug lying atop his hoard (hence all the gold). The back cover has a picture of the dwarves and Bilbo leaving Gandalf at the edge of Mirkwood. Spectacular. Overall, the jacket is very beautiful and makes the book shine.The story (as you may well know) is one of the best stories ever written. It remains (and always will remain) a classic. This book reflects the enchantment of the story. The thick, glossy pages and foolproof and durable binding are a testament to the quality of the story.The watercolor illustrations are another testament to the greatness of the story. Alan Lee dose a wonderful job replicating different events in the story. Alan Lee also drew gray pencil drawings taking up about a quarter of a page (those are done very well as well).Overall, the story is one of the best ever written and this edition of the story is probably the best version ever in print. The paper, print and binding quality is as good as you can get. Alan Lee also did a very good job on all his paintings and drawings. Almost every thing about this book is beautiful."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the book that started the whole Tolken series.

A person finishing this book will have a very strong understanding of exactly what happened in the novel. I agree with other people that this would be a great way for a 7 year old to be introduced to the story.The only thing I would want to change about it is its size. It feels just a tad too small to comfortably fit all the text and panels that it crams into each of its pages. I also feel like the color palette is a bit too bright and cheery throughout. I think the whole thing would have felt more true to the spirit of the book if the saturation levels were pulled back a bit. It might even benefit from being printed on matte paper stock. As it is, the glossy paper and bright colors just don't feel quite right."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This excellent pillar of the fantasy genre is compelling to the bone. The adventure Bilbo embarks is one to envy. The most outstanding detail about Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is the books natural flow, as it simply carries you along as you slowly and cheerfully deepen into the quest. One of my favorite characters is by far, Beorn. Sadly, if you haven't read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", I shan't be able to tell you more about him than he is a fascinating character.

So, naturally I felt I would be less then interested in the topic now that I was older.

I absolutely loved this book and kept flying through the pages eager to be swept up in the little Hobbit's next adventure. Tolkien keeps it fresh by introducing new and different characters throughout the book - and then does an excellent job tying them back into the story by the end.

Humor is very visible in this book, so if you like humor, and if you like fantasy, read The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you haven't already, READ THIS BOOK! Tolkien is the all time master of all fantasy--he basically created the whole genre! If you read the hobbit, you'll know why. The storyline is fantastic, the details are descriptive and imaginitive, and on whole, it's a fabulous book, even if you're not a fantasy fan. The only thing that I can suggest is that you read the Hobbit before picking up Tolkien's other works (namely, LoR or the Silmarillion). If you'd like to get a bit more background on the world of Middle Earth, though, I suggest that you read the Silmarillion. Fair warning, the Silmarillion is MUCH harder to read than LoR or the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot;&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a book of adventure. If you like adventure books you will love The Hobbit! The main character is a hobbit. Hobbits are small man-like creatures. Bilbo Baggins isn't looking for an adventure, but he ends up going on one. There are 13 dwarves, and a Wizard. They are trying to kill a dragon and get the stolen money from the dragon and give it to the owners. Bilbo has to fight goblin's, troll's, and on the way he finds a magic ring that makes him invisible when he puts it on.I like the Hobbit because the ring is so cool, and the book is so exciting when he's talking to a slimy character named Gollum while he risks his life in a riddle competition. The book is so exciting!You should read this book!Warning: The first two chapters are boring but at chapter three the adventure begins!

The plot was facinating, though somewhat conincedental, like when Bilbo slips out of the cave and just happens to find the dwarves and Gandalf. However, there are many interesting word choices. For instance, hobbit originated from the word holbytla, an Old English construct, means hole-builder. So the first sentence can be trnslated to &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hole-builder.&quot; It's a bit of a joke.Most of the names in this book go around in circles like that. To find out more about that, I recommend the Hobbit Companion, by David Day.

It had wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copycats. The story brings the characters to life with very descriptive words. It makes the reader feel as if he/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters.Gandalf, the wizard, is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and clever and can solve just about any problem with his magic or his wits. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with a lot of the different characters you meet throughout the novel. He has many friends of all races (which is unusal for the story) such as dwarves, hobbits, elves and even special magic friends that can be more than one species of animalsThis is very interesting book. It is fun and exciting and paints wonderful adventures in my head. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books.

NO LIE!If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, and home again, and can take an interble hero(blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck) here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler...In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way(as he did)-if you do not already know all about these things-much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves get some glimpes into the history and politics of a neglected but impotant period!When i was reading this book it was like a movie and if i stopped reading i missed the whole movie. A++++++++++++++ Book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I recently re-read THE HOBBIT for the first time in many, many years. I liked it much more as an adult, and especially after reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a saga, while THE HOBBIT is a fairy tale. As such, it is lighter, funnier, and faster-paced than the trilogy. These qualities make it more entertaining and enjoyable.Unlike THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which plods along and contains many chapters where essentially nothing happens, THE HOBBIT contains action in every chapter. A new monster is introduced in each chapter, and something is always happening. The book holds together remarkably well, and contains an arc that ties everything together.The only drawback with THE HOBBIT is shared with all Tolkien that I've read. I think of it as the \\"Eagles Fly Out of the Sky\\" problem. Whenever Tolkien gets his heroes in a particularly tough fix, rather than having them use their wits to escape, he has eagles fly out of the sky and save them, or some other happenstance that is beyond the protagonists' control. The eagles swoop to the rescue twice. This is more than compensated by Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, but even that encounter ends by Bilbo inadvertently asking an unanswerable riddle. While I enjoyed THE HOBBIT enough to think that someday I'll read it a third time, I struggle with the message here and with the rest of the Middle Earth saga - do wits matter? Do things just happen? Should wen go with the flow? Or should wen just marvel at the fantasy?"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is an account of the amazing adventure of Bilbo Baggins. He leaves his lovely hole in the shire, under the guidance of Gandalf the wizard, and a dozen rough and tough dwarves. Although Bilbo is a bit out of place amongst the group, he turns out to be a both an important ally and wonderful friend. This tale will pull you and never let go of you. And it sets the stage for the critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings serious. It gives the backround tale of how the ring came into the hands of our little hobbit heroes and introduces the characters that follow you through the Lord of the Rings. I would recommend this book to anyone with a heart for adventure and a taste for fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The hobbit is such a great book and is well liked because of its story, but I liked it mainly because of how well it is written. There were parts toward the end of the book that seemed to drag a little, but for the most part it was put together rather nice. I loved the fact that it was written as if from another culture and it spoke to the reader as if it was from a familiar culture or one right close to it. It talked to you as if you already knew certain things about something that you might never have heard of, and soon after it explains exactly what it was or hinted in such great detail that no two people could be far apart from what has been drawn in their heads. The Hobbit does such a great job in having the reader come up with his own conclusions of how something will turn out and the book will take some strange twist that proves you right and wrong at the same time. Such as, you know they will escape from something and so you play it out in your mind. When it happens, you had the right idea, but the way it was done wasn't even close to how you saw it happening. This book was written with extreme greatness and is built to always keep you on your toes and to keep you looking forward for what is coming next.

Sadly, that approbation did not last long. Granted, the reading of this story, with its many and varied characters, and many songs and poems, is a daunting task. Unfortunately, I found the narrator's soft, somnolent drone more suited to a bedtime story than an adventure tale, and I even dozed while driving! In addition, I found the pronunciation of the dwarves' names to be odd, and some of the voices to be not as I would have expected, most notably Beorn.Worst of all were the attempts at singing the various songs. It started with the warbling rendition of the delightful \\"That's what Bilbo Baggins hates/So carefully, carefully with the plates!\\", and concluded with a ghastly interpretation of one of my favorite song/poems \\"The Road Goes Ever On\\", the latter which was so awful I actually had to turn off the audiobook a couple of times to seethe before being able to listen to the entire thing.The best thing I can say for this is that it is unabridged narration, and it is better than the BBC dramatization (reviewed below since some quirk in Amazon can't distinguish between these audiobooks for review purposes). Perhaps with the movie spurring a renewed interest in this classic story a better audio interpretation will become available.** Two stars for the BBC DRAMATIZATION of the Hobbit: A dismal rendering from start to finish.For those of you who own and enjoy the stellar Lord of the Rings dramatization with Ian Holm, Bill Nighy, etc., you will unquestionably be, as I was, astonishingly disappointed at this dramatization of The Hobbit. From the cheezy, tinny opening horns, to the horrible voice of Gandalf (sounds more like an effeminate villian in a 1920's melodrama), to the absence of some of the charming passages that made the book colorful (only adventuristic aspects seem to have been included), to the jumble of narrator vs. Bilbo vs. some other character speaking all at once or on top of one another, to the mispronunciation of character names (Thorin sounds like \\"tureen\\", and Gollum is \\"gol-oom\\"...huh?!), this adaptation is, as they say, \\"one hot mess\\" and best avoided, especially for those of you who expect it to be on par with the LOTR radio drama aforementioned."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I needed to reread this before seeing the movie.

I noticed when I wrote this review that it is $18, which is a lot higher (63%). The raise in price is most likely due to the Hobbit being out in theater. I am not sure that the price will go down. I would like to guess that the price will go down in a few months (unless the DVD and Blu-Ray release of the movie spikes the demand in Hobbit related products). If you would wait close to a year, I am afraid that the release of the second Hobbit movie would increase the demands, and thus the price of this book again.Recommendation: Buy it.

I really thought I was going to hate it... But, I didn't! I was so surprised. Every book I've ever read in English has been boring, but this one was really good.Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit (obviously) who likes to stay in his little Hobbit hole and stay to himself. He likes so smoke his pipe, eat, clean, and take naps. His life style does a complete 360 turns when Gandalf arrives and tells Mr. Baggins he will be accompanying the 12 dwarves to go defeat the dragon called Smaug, and take back the land that was one the dwarves. Bilbo doesn't believe him at first and soon enough he got sucked into the whirlwind adventure.All of the adventures in this book keeps you on your toes, I was like what's going to happen next??? I tried not to \\"read ahead\\" or appear too \\"anxious\\" to find out what happened so everyone wouldn't think I was a total nerd lol. My favorite adventure that they took was through the Mountain were Bilbo was knocked out and left behind... This part was so creepy, I kept thinking BILBO GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF THERE!!! Overall this story is fun, adventurous, and a great change of pace. I went into this book with really low expectations and came out really enjoying it.I really enjoyed how Bilbo's character grew as the story progressed.

I got this beautiful edition for Christmas and settled in to let Tolkien's amazingly magical world of Middle Earth open up before my eyes. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit for his own children, but even though it is supposedly a children's book it sweeps adults up as well and holds them in its spell through the entirety of Bilbo's fascinating journey.It is rare that a \\"children's book\\" is considered a prologue to an adult book, The Lord of the Rings (always considered by Tolkien as one book and not a trilogy). I am very glad I read The Hobbit first because it gets the reader acquainted with Middle Earth, and several characters and places are mentioned and continued in Lord of the Rings. At only about 300 pages The Hobbit is a fast and delightful read, and when you are finished you will probably do as I did and immediately begin reading and enjoying the incomparable Lord of the Rings.Although the films are good, Tolkien's imagination has to be experienced firsthand to be believed, and it all starts here with The Hobbit.

It gave great detail and information on Mr. Bilbo that helps the plot in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Quite a number of five-star ratings have been heaped on this book, and I don't think it's terribly shocking to add mine to the pile. However, those familiar with my somewhat critical reviews of the Lord of the Rings series may ask why, exactly, I rate the Hobbit higher. After all, most people in the modern age tend to almost ignore the Hobbit in favor of Tolkien's later trilogy on the war of the ring. Part of this, of course, can be attributed to the movie version, but what is it about the Hobbit that makes it so special?I honestly think that the way people ignore the Hobbit may have something to do with its difference in tone from the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit contains stronger fantasy elements, such as being attacked by a horde of giant spiders, burned almost to death by a dragon, or having boulders thrown at you by the giants in the mountains, and yet, it treats them all perfectly casually, whereas later books would have felt the need to explain these strange happenings. The Hobbit only explains things like this when they're unique, even for Middle Earth. It doesn't take itself as seriously as LOTR did, which actually added to my appreciation of it.It's a story about a small, peace-loving fellow named Bilbo Baggins, and how he goes on an exciting adventure with the old wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves; refugees from the Lonely Mountain, which is now inhabited by the ferocious dragon Smaug. They have many adventures before, after and during their incursion into the mountain, and Bilbo gets to show his mettle as a burglar, a fighter and a treasure-hunter. There are tragedies and battles over the course of the book, and eventually, Bilbo becomes more of a man, and receives honor, riches and the suspicion of his friends and neighbors for doing something so \\"unexpected.\\"The goblins, the spiders, the elves, the dragon, giants, Beorn, the dwarves and so on and so forth. It was good, clean fun, and I loved it all. Men factor into this book, but not nearly as much as in the Lord of the Rings, so by and large, this book is about fantasy in its purest form; fantasy people going on an exciting adventure, learning lessons about themselves and their world, doing incredible things, meeting interesting people, and finding themselves well-rewarded for all their hard work. It's the essence of the fantasy story.Even Bilbo's job as a burglar rarely leads him into doing anything questionable. Yes, he sort of stole the Ring, but Gollum wanted to kill him, so it was his only means of survival. Defending one's survival is enough of a reason to justify this. The same can be said of the meals he stole in the elf prison. The treasure they took from Smaug was really theirs anyway, so it wasn't stealing, as much as taking what was rightfully theirs, and as for the Arkenstone...The Arkenstone. That's an aspect of the story I found puzzling. Bilbo does eventually justify this by ransoming his share of the treasure in exchange for it, so I guess it's just fine morally. Still, I did find it something of an interesting moral dilemma when I first read this book, which, I guess, just makes the story even better, when you think about it.I also found the battles exceptionally-good and well-written. They were described about as well as in later works, but I found them more interesting, on the whole, because of the way the movements and actions of the enemy forces were described. They're the sort of battles that one can actually picture in their mind. Not myth-making battles, like the Shelob fight from the Two Towers, perhaps, but certainly very believable ones once the fantasy elements are taken for granted.It's really hard to write a story about a hired thief who never really does anything morally wrong, and yet, under analysis, the Hobbit seems to be just such a book. A rare and special type of book indeed."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I came to this book late, just before the release of the Ring movies.

Tolkien's first claim to fame, but it is better known as the precursor to the famed Lord of the Rings series. It is a story of struggles, adventures, and unlikely heroes in a land called \\"Middle Earth\\".Hobbits do not like adventures, as the famed Bilbo Baggins once said of adventures, \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\\" With the help of the far more important, but less noted wizard Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) does in fact set out upon an adventure with thirteen Dwarves to return to Lonely Mountain and regain their treasure, in so defeating the cruel dragon, Smaug.They out wit orcs and goblins, battle spiders and evade elves, Bilbo finds the Ring, yes the Ring, and out riddles the morose Gollum to keep it. They achieve many things, making many friends and even more enemies before reaching old Smaug and the Lonely Mountain, and still they know not what to do about it's treachery.The Hobbit was definitely not a stroke of genius, but a work of genius after years and years of writing lore on goblins, elves, dragons, dwarves, and such, such is all the great things you may have or may yet come to love in Tolkien's writing. The Hobbit however, is a first in Tolkiens lore, and The Hobbit was the first taste of Tolkien much of the world got. Although over shadowed my the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is important in understanding Middle Earth, and it does it in a fun way. It is something you could teach you kids to read with, while still enjoying it yourself.The Hobbit was originally intended to be a before bedtime kids book, and it sends a very potent message to it's intended victim...it doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, or how big you are, even the smallest can change the world. To more extent, hopefully we are, in the end, better off, but that is a matter of opinion, for greed is the bleeder of wealth, and happiness can be found in small things, even after big adventures. I did find Tolkien's style rather youthful and informative allowing me to see far in advance the come of events...nonetheless he did an excellent job in portraying the turn of events that was and is The Hobbit. His imagery and imagination are unrivalled, yes, even to those of us who saw the movie first. For those of you who don't like Old English, don't worry, it's hardly used in The Hobbit. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the Lord of the Rings, or simple wants a good book to read to the young ones before the lights are turned out. Further more I expect you'll get hooked on Middle Earth, so I suggest finding a copy of the Lord of the Rings, because lets face it, for those of us with an imagination, the books are way better."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit.J.R.R.Tolkien.United States- New York.Ballantine Books.1937, 1938, and 1966.287 pages.My attention was grabbed, my mind was stretched, and my thoughts were taken to amazing enchanting places. Reading \\"The Hobbit\\" was not only and intriguing experience, but kept me wanting more and more. When a timid, respectable creature called a hobbit is talked into going on a wild, dangerous quest by a wizard by the name of Gandalf, Bilbo's cozy, quiet lifestyle is drastically changed. J.R.R. Tolkien is an incredible story teller, and his studies of ancient languages and his life in Britain influenced and enhanced the ideas and characters in the book. The fictional land of Middle-Earth in which the story takes place is magical and sometimes evil. Bilbo Baggins leaves the comfortable, beautiful shire to embark on a journey in the midst of danger and evil, and along the way he is transformed into a hero.By the author showing Bilbo's development into a hero, he proves that ordinary people can overcome obstacles and also develop into heroes. Bilbo started off as a weakling. He was surrounded by luxury and a wide array of foods, but after he got over the shocking news, he accepted Gandalf's request for him to be the \\"burglar\\" of the quest, and from then on he got increasingly courageous. By the end of the journey, he had accomplished so much. He had confronted the trolls, escaped from Gollum and stolen his ring, slaying a giant spider, rescuing the dwarves from Mirkwood, and even coming face to face with a treacherous, gold-stealing dragon named Smaug. All of these things molded him into a hero, not to mention helping the dwarves regain their stolen wealth, and making the area surrounding Lonely Mountain safe again.When the author wrote this book, he was looking past its enchanting tale to the trilogy to come known as \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" This book is the solid foundation of which all of those books follow. This book really emphasizes the character development of the main character, Bilbo. It is interesting the way the author created the creatures of middle earth in that all hobbits are good, but all goblins are evil, and the personality of someone differed according to their family. Bilbo Baggins is heir to the Tooks, who are more adventurous, and the Baggins's, who are very respectable and would never take part in such radical happenings. Throughout the story he sometimes switches back and forth between each family's point of view, but for him to reach his full potential he must be like the Tooks so he can be courageous and unafraid to partake in the great quest for the dwarves stolen gold. In the book I also noticed that there is a constant struggle between good and evil. The magic ring that Bilbo acquires from a hideous creature named Gollum in the darkness of a deep tunneling cave, affects him in a powerful way. The ring he found allows him to disappear instantly when he puts it on his finger. Although he thinks this is very useful, the ring is evil and Bilbo becomes addicted to it and always keeps it with him.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a good, original read, but it obviously lacks realism because of it's out of this world setting and characters. That's not so bad though because it is fun reading about something that is completely made up, so you can leave your present state of mind and just relax and enjoy the book. J.R.R. Tolkien had a very smart way of writing which is shown in the elaborate details he put into each creature and the way he made everything come together in a complete way at the end but at the same time made you want to read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. I did not detect any flaws in the plot, but then again I wasn't really looking for them because I was so caught up in the story. I have never read a book that has a similar subject as \\"The Hobbit\\" because it is so unique, so it makes it difficult to compare it to other books in that way. Relating to the book can be done only by the underlying tones, not the actual events since it is a fantasy.

Along the way there many obstacles they must face. They also must make it to the cave (where the dragon lives) on Durin's Day , which is the only time the keyhole to the door is shown. Will they make it? Will they survive?There were many things I liked about The Hobbit, but my favorite thing about it was it was very adventurous. They trick trolls, escape from jail, kill giant spiders, and best of all, fight a dragon.There were also some things I disliked about the book. I didn't like how the book dragged on and there was so much detail that it took away from the enjoyment sometimes."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The HobbitThe prelude to The Lord of the Rings trilogy begins with a descriptive insight into what a hobbit is. In this epic about a little, non-adventurous person, J. R. R. Tolkien introduces Bilbo Baggins to his first adventure. The Hobbit starts off with Gandalf, the wizard, paying Bilbo an unexpected visit, not only bringing along thirteen guests, but bringing Bilbo the news that would change his life, forever. I enjoyed reading this adventure-filled epic, as it took me on countless journeys and introduced me to goblins, wild wolves, orcs, eagles, elves, and many, many more creatures found throughout the novel. The adventures never ended, and when I thought I was safe to conclude a happy ending, another villain was at hand. The twist and turns take readers out of their reading places and into the dungeons and caves along with Bilbo and his companions.I would recommend this epic to open-minded people who can let their minds wander once and awhile. People should not begin reading this novel if they are not imaginative and cannot picture weird creatures never before seen. Also, if you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you will definitely love this prelude. This epic will interest those adventure-fantasy lovers out there!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a very good book.

This is what Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit is trying to do. This exciting tale is written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Meticulous Bilbo goes through many challenges to get his gold, and has many near death experiences. The protagonist in this story is viewed through third person, or narrator form.This hobbit, being so little, having big padded feet, and curly hair as they all do, must face many challenges. One of them is meeting Gollum, a horrible, sneaky little creature who lives back in the caves of the goblins. First, the dwarves that are with Bilbo and of course Bilbo himself are running from the goblins where he is knocked out. Second, when he wakes up he finds a ring and decides to go looking for the others. After walking quite a ways in the darkness he steps into something cold. At this time he meets Gollum. This creature then makes a deal with him...If Biblo wins a riddle game, Gollum won't eat him... if Bilbo doesn't win the game Gollum will eat him. Do you think Gollum is going to play a trick, or as Gollum would say, \\"play a tricksy\\" on Bilbo?Another exciting part is when Bilbo is like a kidnapper during the story. Bilbo is on the verge of being caught when he thinks up a plan to help his crew that he is with to get the treasure. He must get each of them and help them out of being captured. His plan is to get into barrels left over from food and drinks that are put into a river. Then they are floated to near the crew's destination. Will they make it?Ladies and gentlemen invite you to read The Hobbit. It is a wonderful book, and I encourage you to read it. So if you want to see if he out lasts Gollum and resists getting caught, read The Hobbit!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as ebony with them shut. No one was near him. He could feel nothing, see nothing, except for the stone of the floor.\\" In The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, a meticulous hobbit, finds himself in an adventure. Bilbo has to go along with thirteen dwarves and a wizard, named Gandalf, to slay a dragon named Smog. They have to slay Smog because he stole treasure from the dwarves many years ago.An exiting part of The Hobbit is when Bilbo finds a ring when he was left behind in the goblins' tunnels. \\"His head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they (the dwarves, Gandalf, and himself) had been going in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, until suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking...\\" What is this ring? Is it any importance to Bilbo? Read The Hobbit to find out more.Another exiting scene is when Bilbo first sees Gollum. \\"Deep down by the dark waters lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature, as dark as darkness, except for two big, round, pale eyes that glowed like telescopes in his thin face. Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the tiny island in the middle of the lake; while Bilbo was sitting on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of is way and wits. Suddenly, up came Gollum he whispered and hissed, \`Bless us and splash us my precioussss! I guess it's a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel it'd make us, gollum!' When he said \\"gollum\\" he made a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name, though he always called himself, \\"my precious.\\"Those are only two small parts of his adventure because he still has to beat his final challenge, Smog the dragon. What will be the fate of Bilbo? Will he survive or be barbecued alive? Tune into The Hobbit to find out."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a delightful tale about a single hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who breaks away from his normal, every-day hobbit-life to go on an adventure. Not that he exactly wanted to go on any adventures, which are very frowned upon by the hobbit society, mind you, but the crafty wizard Gandalf rather tricked him into it. So, Bilbo left behind his normal life and hobbit-hole and joined his companions to start their journey, \\"one fine morning just before May.\\"Throughout the story, I really enjoyed reading J.R.R. Tolkien's descriptions of people, objects, and even situations. The descriptions really allowed a reader to draw a fantastic picture in his head, while, at the same time, didn't put up too many walls or restrictions as to not allow much, if any, room for variations in different people's perceptions. From his head-to-toe description of a hobbit to his inside-and-out description of the Baggins' residence, Mr. Tolkien really makes the reader become a part of the story through his descriptions.I also liked the plot line in its entirety. Mr. Tolkien was able to keep things moving and keep the reader wanting to read, but, also, allow some parts to be less action oriented through his use of suspense. He didn't make the characters run into problems left and right during every leg of their journey, yet he wouldn't slow things down so much that he would cause the reader to lose interest either.The last thing I would like to point out that I liked in particularly was Mr. Tolkien's use of riddles in different parts of the story. In fact, Bilbo and Gollum's \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter was one of my favorite parts of the book. I found it very fun, though also very challenging at times, to play along and try to figure out each riddle before reading on to see if I was correct. Also, another riddling part of the book that I enjoyed was when Bilbo spoke to Smaug in a very riddling manner.Though I liked most of Mr. Tolkien's style of writing and use of riddles, I found some parts a little hard to follow at times. \\"There a warm welcome was made them...\\" is one example. Not that it was necessarily all that hard to follow, more so that I don't hear talk like that very often, and it was a little odd to hear at first.Now, like I said, The Hobbit is about Mr. Bilbo Baggins who is pulled away from his home in The Hill and ventures past The Water when Thorin and Company hires him as a burglar. Everything starts out well enough and they make their way towards their destination. But, things make a turn for the worse when they run into three rather unpleasant fellows in the woods. They manage to push on, though, and get a nice rest, thanks to Elrond, before running into their next hardship. I'm talking, of course, about their run-in with a not-so-nice crowd on the Misty Mountains. Yet, somehow, they even manage to make it though that little skirmish, and Bilbo even picks up a little something along the way. However, Bilbo and the gang are far from safe, even after getting away from those whose acquaintances they had made on the Misty Mountains. Yes, once they had escaped the dangers of the Misty Mountains, they really found themselves up a tree! But, luckily, thanks to a little outside help, they made it safely to the home of Beorn, where they stayed for a short time before venturing further. All this and poor Bilbo and his companions still haven't made their way through the awful Mirkwood Forest, the marshes on the far side of it, or the valley of Dale, where the Lonely Mountain and the terrible Smaug himself awaited!Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I would have to say that it's the best book that I have read, to this day. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy action, adventure, suspense, and a good plot line. However, I would also recommend that those who do decide to read The Hobbit have a good imagination and brush up on their knowledge of certain fantastical creatures, such as dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and wargs, a bit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" to me was one of the best books I have ever read.

It is the most abyssmal plodding reading possible! I can't imagine the audience for whom the book was written-is it children? ... because it is terribly juvenile and silly [but definitely not in an enjoyable way-mostly annoying and idiosyncratic]...but if the target audience IS children, the stylized writing and archaic use of English completely upsets that purpose! And it can most definitely not be for an adult audience for it has nothing to offer to the current generation of fantasy readers.If you haven't read it and are thinking of buying it-my suggestion would be that you don't!And btw the foreword and backpage comments from famous authors mention that it is an exercise in \\"escapism\\" which is what the fantasy genre was called back when the book was written...please spare yourself. If you have children, please buy them Artemis Fowl or Pendragon or any of the Issac Assimov books. If you read fasntasy for your own pleasure-ditto. But then again LOTR is an undisputed masterpiece.

The story does not end with the reclamation of Erebor, but I will avoid mentioning anything after to try not to spoil it too much!It is an epic tale written with younger readers in mind than The Lord of the Rings, but still full of the adventure and the true neither-completely-good-nor-completely-evil good vs. evil battles Tolkien is so great at writing.

In the beginning of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins hated the idea of adventure, but he could only do so much to stop this one when thirteen dwarves and one wizard came to his little hobbit-hole in the hill.The lot of them needed his services as a burglar to gain their treasure back from he dragon, Smaug. He hesitantly agreed to go, and on the way, the group found Bilbo to be very handy, noble, and adventurous. Though the one to actually kill the dragon was a warrior from Dale, Bilbo played a large part in the entirety of the greater peace found after Smaug's death in the lands around. I strongly recommend this book to adventure-lovers and those in need of some inspiration.One reason that I liked this book was that it had many points of great suspense, such as when Bilbo woke up to find a giant spider's eyes and legs tying his legs together to eat him. Bilbo luckily woke up in time to kill the spider. Also, when Bilbo and his friends had to fight off the trolls, it seemed possible that Bilbo would get his toes singed, or they would all get eaten. It was a point of great suspense when Bilbo darted invisibly from tree to tree, away from the spiders who were trying ton eat him and his friends, who were hanging from a web some way off.Another good part of this book was the mystery that loomed in the background, though sometimes it was unnoticed until it was directly brought up. For example, when Thorin was lost from the group, it was quite unknown where he had gone, and it wasn't brought up for quite a while. Also, it was a mystery how Bilbo would get into his barrel, which he didn't get to, because he didn't think of it, but ended up floating down the river on top of it. It was quite a mystery how they would get out of the trees surrounded by wargs and goblins, but were eventually saved by eagles.My favorite part of this book was the way it often made it seem impossible for the dwarves and Bilbo to go any further, like when they were in the Goblin's passages, in front of the Great Goblin, about to be eaten, or when they got caught in the forest with no idea of how to get out. The best example was when they got stuck in the elven-palace, guarded by elves and a spell-ridden gate.The Hobbit was a very satisfactory reads, full of suspense, adventure, and friendship. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book that keeps you turning the pages through Bilbo's adventure.-K.Carson"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"One of my favorite books ever.

I suppose there is some justice in retrieving the dwarf treasure from the clutches of the dragon, but it seemed so rooted in greed than in justice that just didn't seem a story-worthy plot or one worth risking life and limb for. And the first 50% of the book was just so whiny - I'm hungry! I'm thirsty! I'm sleepy! I'm cold! I'm wet! I want to go back! - that it reminded me of many a hike and camping trip in Scouts when I was a patrol leader with kids on their first time out.And yet, Bilbo does emerge as a leader of the quest, and learns a lor about himself in doing so. In that, I think a child would find inspiration in what is, at heart, a children's story.It is must reading to backfill the lore in Lord of the Rings, but the sense of good vs. evil is *so* much better in LotR than in the Hobbit.And speaking of greed: 3 movies for a 300-page book?

Listening to it ensures that you don't miss a thing, and you are still free to project your own images in your mind. The fact that this is unabridged means that it is all here, nothing is left out. Rob Inglis's narration is great, with enough vocal variation to distinguish among the characters. For a Tolkien fan, and one who has read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings since high school, listening to them after all these years is a revelation. Immerse yourself in Middle Earth, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I never used to like Harry Potter- I had never read the book. I did and I wanted to read more more more. This is the same way. I have just read this book and I found it truly a brilliant, magical fantasy epic.This magical story starts of telling you about Bilbo and his hobbit-hole (I had to put down the book for a while, I will admit.... don't do it though... once you get past that part it gets much better). He, a wizard (Gandalf) and 12 dwarves set off for a great adventure to defeat the great Dragon Smaug and get back the treasure he once stole from the town of Dale. They all will get an equal share once they find it. Along the way they meet:-goblins-eagles-wolves-elves-giant spiders-and many other thingsWhat a fantastic story. A MUST read. After this you must also read The Lord of the Rings Series.

Children and adults alike will find themselves drawn into Tolkien's world. There are so many elements a teacher can draw from this text: characterization, imagery, setting, plot, etc. However, unskilled readers might have some difficulty with it for a variety of reasons. They might have trouble reading long narrative paragraphs with little dialogue, keeping track of all of the character and the characters' roles, and understanding the abstract concepts found in the work. We recommend this text for upper-level high school students, who are more experienced readers, and able to draw a lot out of a text. However, it is a fun read for anyone who is interested in fantasy and the world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit-is a Tolkiens classic.It's about a hobbit named Bilbo, a wizard, and 12 dwarfs who go on an adventure to get the long lost treasure of a dwarf, which was stolen from a dragon. As you can tell it's jammed packed with action and adventure!WARNING-the first couple chapters are a drag but keep reading and you'll be hooked. Just to keep you interested, they come across goblins, wargs, spiders, and trolls.Once you read this book, you'll be hooked in Tolkien's world , and the quest to destroy the ring. O'yeah, you don't figure that out until you start The Fellowship.I read this book this year and I'm 11, so practically anybody can read it. It's my favorite book because I like action, adventure, and medieval times. So if you like that stuff The Hobbit is the right book for you. Hope you enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Ok; for those kids who need an introduction to the Lord of the Rings, enjoy reading, hate reading, love fantasy, or simply like to have stories read to them, this is the book. It is superbly voiced by Rob Inglis, who seems to make each character distinctly stand out in your head by mere intonation. He makes the reading fun. And it's great for long car trips, because there are quite a few tapes. My kids listen to it while they are doing their chores- it keeps them from getting distracted. Now be warned: there are a few scary elements, such as wolves, nasty goblins, a slimy cannibal cave creature called Gollum, a dragon, and a large war at the end which is not described too much, but in which many people including a few main characters die. Thus, it is lot for the little kiddies as much as the 9-11 age or older.But don't get me wrong; this book is a lot of fun for older folks, too. It is a great treatment of the hobbit for fans of Tolkien of all ages, but it isn't at all a bore for those who know nothing about the books. If you're thinking about getting the trilogy, this is a nice introduction (it differs a bit in tone and style, but it's the same world). I love this production; it's very good."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read the hobbit in about 2 weeks. it is the best bookI have ever read.

Please note that the material is not leather, rather a good imitation of it.The paper is thick, with the text being printed in black with green accents. The text itself is large, easy to read and goes on for 320 pages. I did not notice any imperfection, missing paragraphs or pages or chapters.There are five full color illustrations by J.R.R. himself and a good number of two colored drawings. You will also find Thror's Map as drawn by the author.Overall, this packaging is sturdy and sure to last for generations and many re-readings.

TolkienIt is a Faiytale Adventure.It is a story of Bilbo baggins, who is a hobbit. One day he finds himself in an adventure with dwarf. After his adventure he realizes he barely excapes with his life and adventures are funner than he thought.In a way this is very much like, The Call of the Wild by Jack London, because Buck and Bilbo were both taken from there home and force to go were they did not want to go; but Bilbo made it back to his home and Buck didn't.If you don't like reading try reading this.I very much like the style that Tolkien wrote this book in, because it keeps you wanting to see what is going to happen to Bilbo. On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;. Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do. If you have never been on an adventure yourself, you should try going with a Hobbit named Bilbo. Even though Tolkien is a great writer, there are some drawbacks to his style.

I remember my brother had it as some required reading in secondary school.My recent interest in the story emanated from the conversation I had with a couple of male friends, since the movie is coming out at the end of the year. I asked them what the main plot to the story was - their descriptions peaking my interest. They proceeded to tell me that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was the first book so I was quite excited about getting a copy to read. At the bookstore, I was pleased to find this illustrative edition, which has some fantastic pictures. When I showed it to my friend he was very envious and wanted to borrow my copy...even though he just recently finished reading the story again. Suffice it to say that this further increased my interest in the book and story. The graphics really aid in imaginating how the characters look when reading the story for the first time. I have already bought the matching illustrative version for the combined &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; books.I haven't yet finished &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but I am sure that I won't be disappointed and if anything, both books will look great on the bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The characters in Tolkien's story are lively and likeable as well as realistic in regards to personality and traits. The story telling is fantastic and detailed. Tolkien talks through third person, but uses the character Bilbo Baggins as a conveyor for the story line. The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is a story I would recommend to anyone, whether fantasy fiction is their gig or not.Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit. He belongs to a quiet folk who enjoy a good meal to eat and a pipe to smoke. As Bilbo is doing just this one morning, an old acquaintance who happens to be a wizard named Gandalf comes calling. Gandalf brings with him a band of dwarves who seem to have no where else to stay, and Bilbo can only be hospitable. The dwarves, led by an &quot;enormously important dwarf&quot; named Thorin Oakenshield, impose upon Bilbo, invading his home and eating his food, but in turn offering jovial company, great stories and song singing. Soon, however, the dwarves reveal their purpose for their unexpected visit. They wish for Bilbo to accompany them on their treasure hunt . . .I charish this novel for several reasons. One reason I enjoy this story so much is because there is no beating around the bush; everything is &quot;one-two-three go&quot;. There is no long introduction in the story's beginning that will take sense away from the story if you do not read it, like in many fantasy novels. I also enjoy the way Tolkien writes verse and poetry and riddles into his story. When the dwarves come to Bilbo's home, they sing songs about treasure. While on the road, elves are overheard singing as they travel through the forest, as well as goblins. Later, when Bilbo encounters the infamous Gollum, they exchange several riddles. Tolkien is a talented poet as well as a story teller. Most of all, however, I enjoy the quaint humor and almost over-abundant common sense of Mr. Baggins. He is a delightful character to read, and he makes Tolkien's novel a gem to be treasured."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have read The Hobbit, and I think that it was an exellent book.

The settings are interested enough, the character development is adequate, and the prose is satisfactory. But these authors have a wealth of personal knowledge of language, metaphor, and/or the human condition that makes the reading not only fun, but an adventure in satire, sociology, semiotics, history, and philosophy.

I recalled the basic plot elements and the overall premise of the story. And, because I'm breathing, I know that it's the prequel to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. And, since it's considered a classic, my expectations were high.I'm wondering, however, why I feel so underwhelmed by this novel. It contains all the elements of a classic, mythic heroic quest. It's not unnecessarily lengthy or bloated (a mere 255 pages in the edition that I read), and the episodic narrative moves along at a smart pace. Tolkien has indeed created one of the great fantasy worlds in all of literature--Middle Earth.Perhaps it's the skimpy character development that bugs me. Bilbo and Gandalf and Thorin are quite memorable (especially Gandalf, who figures prominently in the ensuing LOTR novels), but Tolkien provides minimal characterization. Each is rather two-dimensional, and, as a reader, I found it quite difficult to empathize with any of them. I also found Tolkien's narrative voice to be decidedly uneven--at times the narrator sounded charming and colloquial only to veer into bombast and melodrama, and the narrative tone fluctuated from self-deprecating to self-important. And a few of the major events in the story lack detail. For example, we are told rather little about the climactic Battle of Five Armies, and, of Bilbo's return home, the narrator simply states, \\"He had many hardships and adventures before he got back\\"--yet he describes none of them. Perhaps I'm quibbling--and I know many of the Tolkien faithful will accuse me of sacrilege--but I expect more substance and narrative depth from a classic of fantasy literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have read every word published under Tolkien's name. i have seen every movie and documentary associated with his works.

I've read and re-read it, memorized the poems and riddles, and yes, I've already purchased my ticket for the new film coming out in December. This book, this delightful fairytale, is perfect for children starting around age six or so, and a must-read if you started with the Lord of the Rings films.

R. R. Tolkien prior to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and sets the stage somewhat for the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). The Hobbit is not so much a prequel as it is a story set in the same fictional universe of Middle Earth.One interesting note is that the Hobbit took 20 years to write, while the LOTR trilogy took 16 years. What gives the stories such richness is that very fact. Tolkien took great pains to set the backdrop for each story.Book HighlightsThere are definite points of similarity between the two works. For example the ring that Bilbo finds is the same ring in LOTR that is known as the \\"Ring of Power\\". In the Hobbit, the ring functions mainly as a means of escape and evasion for Bilbo. It enables him to escape from the character Gollum for example. In the LOTR trilogy, the ring has grown in power and calls out to Sauron (its rightful owner). The ring in the Hobbit only seems to have the power of invisibility, given to the wearer. By comparing the two (LOTR and the Hobbbit) the ring is not dangerous to wear for Bilbo, but by the time Frodo is chosen as the ring bearer in LOTR, the ring places the wearer in great danger. It attracts the ring-wraiths (ghost riders that serve Sauron).(Warning Spoilers Below)Gandalf also figures prominently in the Hobbit. His function is to select Bilbo to play the role of burglar in the company of the Dwarfs. Their mission is to recover the stolen treasure that Smaug the Dragon had taken away from the Dwarf people. Bilbo is of course very clever and does help the Dwarfs out of some close scrapes. Gandalf helps the party out as well throughout the book. All in all, their mission is successful. They do in the end free the treasure and Smaug is killed by an archer in the nearby Lake Town.Book EvaluationI think the Hobbit is a very engrossing fantasy story. Tolkien pioneered the genre. It makes sense that he took 20 years to write the tale. The main characteristic of this type of book is its believability. It immerses the reader fully in the story. It immediately draws the reader in to care about the characters and the plot. Tolkien was without a doubt a genius and wrote with a very high level of skill. While there are some differences in emphasis between the LOTR and the Hobbit, the two stories do tie together well. I would say what would have improved the Hobbit is to have added some foreshadowing of the rise of Sauron and show the evil power behind the ring. Whether or not you might like to read in the fantasy genre, I would recommend this book to everyone. This is one of the best examples in this genre, and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure, the story was very well believable and easy to follow."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The book was great and i just love the golem part when he always says my precious and the the riddle game"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I REALLY LOVE THIS STORY.

Besides these, there is several hardcover editions and paperbacks, though not the same finish of the collector's.My point is, there is little you could complain about the collector's editions.About THIS edition: I already had theThe Hobbit (Illustrated/Collector Edition)[There and Back Again], and they are practically the same but for some extra pages telling some of the always interesting story of the editions and the gold for the green color. Nonetheless, I think the green is more close to what the book is made of and I think it looks better, too. Though, they both are very beautiful works.If you want the best edition and don't mind about anniversary ones, I'd say you get the green; it's easier to find and more hobbit like.But, before you decide, take a look at the pretty little 70 anniversary editionThe Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition; it's made just like the 1937 one.The road goes ever on and on..."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"That the Hobbit is a great story goes without saying.

However, I came to \\"The Hobbit\\" in reverse fashion: at the recommendation of a ten year old boy. He had to do some convincing, too, as I'm not a fan of fantasy; I'm sure I began \\"Lord of the Rings\\" long ago and put it down.That's how I came to be curled up in a chair on a winter's afternoon, avidly following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. What drew me in? Well, events in this well-plotted novel move swiftly, of course, and the human foibles of the not-quite-human denizens of Middle Earth are surprisingly compelling. I liked the knowing voice of the omniscient narrator, with its winks and nudges, and I laughed at the middle-aged persona of Bilbo as he longs for toast and a warm fire even as he leaves his hobbit-hole further and further behind. What moved me the most, however, was the climactic Battle of the Five Armies. It is a battle that features goblins and Wargs, dwarves and elves, a shape-shifting warrior and eagle platoons, but it is full of human sorrow in the kind of devastated landscape that only human wars produce.Thus, to put it succinctly, unlike my young friend, I read the book as allegory. (I'm a grown-up; I can't help it.) I'm rather glad that I waited so long to enjoy a book that everyone else discovered a long time ago.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I wasn't sure if my seven-year old son would enjoy the story of the Hobbit. I certainly *hoped* he would. His reading level isn't where it would need to be to read this book, so I decided to read this to him. I am not disappointed. This is now my fourth or fifth time reading The Hobbit, which I've had four 24 years. With no doubt, reading this to a seven-year old boy has made this absolutely the most thrilling time I've read this. We are barely more than 1/2 way through, so I'm reviewing the experience mainly. My boy asks when we can sit down and read more. He looks like he's ready to fall asleep on the couch but wants me to press on. He pictures himself as the hobbit (being the same size and all), carrying Sting at his side. I try to make as many expressions as I can to read and he reacts to the book. And the mind of a seven-year old catches details that his poor father has missed along the way. I will be sad when we finish this book. This is proving to be a great bonding experience and so I'm paying more attention to every detail in the book and that only increases my enjoyment value of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I finished reading The Hobbit with my 4-year-old today, and I'm honestly sad that we're already through the book. What with the epic scope and the formal writing of The Lord of the Rings, it's easy to forget just how accessible, charming, and even funny The Hobbit really is. At its core, The Hobbit is a simple adventure story - a reluctant hero who accompanies some dwarves on a quest to recapture a dragon's gold - but as with all of Tolkien's work, it's the richness of the world that truly captures the imagination. From arrogant dragons to irritable Elven kings, from greedy relatives to goblin warriors, Tolkien creates a world that you could easily get lost in. But first and foremost, he weaves a great adventure yarn. Here's a story with underground mazes, riddle contests, capable (if a little arrogant) wizards, bizarre creatures, and so much more, and Tolkien ties it all into a compulsively enjoyable read. And, yes, as serious and epic as Rings is, The Hobbit is funnier and more enjoyable. Gandalf gets some wonderfully dry lines, the narrator is a little sarcastic, Bilbo genuinely likeable...I could go on and on. Here's all you need to know: both this 30-year-old and my 4-year-old often read more than we planned on every night, and we were both a little sad to get to the end of it today.

Yes and no. Keep in mind the man, and the times. Tolkien was a survivor of trench warfare in the World War, the most brutal and dehumanizing form of hate and ugliness mankind had yet devised. He would not have been eager to glorify combat, and indeed the focus is on the adventure rather than the hack and slash.I'll not compare the morals and mores of 1930s Britain to the world of today, except to note that children then were more mature, and adults were less jaded. The Hobbit struck the right balance for the time. In a world without television, Middle Earth was good entertainment.In my re-reading, I found one particular passage very interesting. Recall the scene of confrontation between Thorin Oakenshield's dwarves and the men of the devastated Lake-town. Bard makes an appeal to Thorin for a share of the treasure, citing the damage and death done to innocents and the fact that a good portion of the gold had come from their ancestors. A very stirring case, and the reader finds himself nodding along. \\"Yeah! We gave the dwarves food and shelter, and sang songs about them, and they went up there and got Old Smaug all fired up, and now they're going to keep all the cookies? All we got out of the deal was burnt stumps where our town used to be!\\"*But then Thorin makes his reply, reminding the Lake-men that he himself is the rightful heir to the Kingdom Under The Mountain. \\"You people come marching up here to my house, armed with bows and spears, demanding a share of what is mine? You can leave you weapons at home, and ask nicely, and we might talk. But as it is, you look like thieves and robbers, and we don't negotiate with terrorists!\\"*Both are good arguments, so who is right? It may not be the exact point Tolkien is trying make, but I took from this the thought that forced charity isn't charity at all - that a grudging charity only leads to hatred and bloodshed. The author doesn't answer the question; the standoff is resolved when goblins swarm down the mountain and all sides must unite for survival.Or maybe that is his answer.Read The Hobbit again. It's still as good as it was the first time.

I also enjoyed going back and seeing the differences in Tolkien's concepts of characters and such between this book and Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Mr. Inglis does an excellent job narrating The Hobbit. His different voices for each character adds a little extra to this timeless story. I consider myself a veteran reader of The Hobbit, The Silmarillion along with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I cannot count the times I have read all the books. I started reading them back in the 70s long before the resent popularity push. The story is a great escape from my stressful life style. This rendition is no different. The only drawback I have to listening to an audiobook is my concentration level. If I play the CDs while roaming the web or doing other work, I loose a lot of the story. There is nothing better than settling down with a good book, but I guess someone else reading it to you comes in a close second. This audiobook is one that should be used as a bedtime story for the young'ns. That is why Mr. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, and here is your chance to be a hero for once."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My husband and I had both read The Hobbit previously to listening to this recording of the book, so we were both familiar with the story. However, hearing it read so well with such expression made it come alive all over again, without seeming boring or rote. We appreciated Rob Inglis's voices for various main characters and were entertained by his interpretation of the passages consisting mainly of songs, which, put to a tune, were more entertaining than simply reading them as verse.

I figured the book was overrated like a lot of others out there, but I can assure you that it most definately is not! Some complain of Tolkeins characters (females anyway) stopping at the neck. Inspite of the truth of this, it's effect on the story is virtually nonexistant. Tolkein is the father of fantasy and his books are the basis of the genre he pretty much created. If you are a fan of fantasy, this is the series that should have been read prior to any others. Most fantasy authors put a feel of Tolkein in their words (Jordan is one example), but that doesn't mean that they are trying to be Tolkein. So if you read fantsy after Tolkein, and think the author was trying to imitate Tolkein, don't jump to conclusions. A lot of authors see that as a way of paying homage to the man who wrote the books they know theirs will be judged by. Keep that in mind and read these books!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book was by far the best book I have ever read.....and I have read ALOT of books!!

It is an inspirational coming-of-age tale, starring a reluctant hero who is made of tougher stuff than he realizes. It is a classic--perhaps timeless--children's tale that adults enjoy more so than the younger audience, especially in modern times. It is an epic fantasy tale that has influenced the genre--along withThe Lord of the Rings--more than any other book. However, it is not--in my opinion--perfect.The biggest complaint you'll find about \\"The Hobbit\\" is that the prose is 'too descriptive.' You'll see many Tolkien-enthusiasts bashing those who think that, insinuating that those reviewers who dislike Tolkien's style are simply too stupid to properly understand it. I, however, disagree. It all comes down to a matter of taste and, for me (at times), Tolkien's highly descriptive prose bogs the story down a bit too much. However, not a sentence in this story can be deemed \\"bad,\\" because the writing--whether you consider it too descriptive or 'just right'--is beautiful. His talent for describing both landscape and character is immense, and will leave any high-fantasy fan more than satisfied.\\"The Hobbit\\" is undoubtedly a beautiful book. As I said, I wouldn't call it perfect, but the story of Bilbo Baggins and his epic adventure is at the very least a \\"must-have.\\" I recommend you buy it in hardcover, preferably the Alan Lee Illustrated Edition, so it will last through the ages.8/10"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is an amazing book to read.

While LOTR focuses on a grand and epic battle encompassing Middle Earth in its entirety, The Hobbit is a more romantic tale - focusing on a single quest and taking its time to storytell. Its simple \\"there and back again\\" feel and lighter mood make it one of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster -- not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime. Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but complex and sometimes menacing.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a story about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. From where he lives, it is unrespectful of anyone if they go on an adventure. One day, a powerful wizard named Gandalf comes to his hobbit hole and invites over a team of 13 dwarves the next day. Hobbit holes are the homes of hobbits. They throw a large party, breaking pots and pans, tiring out Bilbo.They stay at Bilbo's home for the night, which had just enough room for them. Bilbo wakes up really late in the morning, to find a note that tells him to meet the dwarves in a few minutes. This is the start of Bilbo's worst times( with little or no food). I really enjoyed this book because it was really amazing with close saves and a good ending. Read this exciting book to see what is in store for Bilbo."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in fantasy type stories.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I love The Hobbit. I love the way Tolkien writes. I am rereading this book for the 4th time in anticipation of the movie. This edition of the book is great. It's sturdy, has great binding and is actually a lot more light weight than it looks. I have the same edition of The Lord Of The Rings in red leather with a red leather slipcase and that book is like a dumbbell. Granted, that book is a lot bigger in content and page count, but it's noticeably heavier than its predecessor. I like that the Hobbit is a shorter book and more light hearted in content than Lord Of The Rings. I loved the Rankin/Bass cartoon Hobbit movie, I just love the characters and the story. Traveling through Middle Earth to reclaim treasure from a Dragon is just a great idea for a book. It's so well written, the songs, the poems, the riddles in the dark. This isn't just a children's book as it was once originally thought of, this is a benchmark for modern literature and fantasy. So many pieces of fantasy that I have grown up with and been a fan of have borrowed from this book, and Tolkien's ideas and creations. And for good reason. This and The Lord of the Rings I think are two of the best books of the 20th century, and two of the best books ever written. The Hobbit is my all-time favorite book. If you haven't read it yet, you need to. This edition comes with great illustrations and a decent map to follow the protagonists on their journey to the Lonely Mountain to steal back the dwarven treasure from the great worm Smaug, the Dragon. This is my most highly recommended book to anyone who likes literature or fantasy writing.

Tolkien, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first of a series of books that constitute Tolkien's legacy, one which, like many other literary masterpieces, has stood the test of time. The hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, is forced to face his destiny by the wizard Gandalf; one that gradually gains him the respect of his companions (thirteen dwarves, along with the wizard) and many other characters in a year-long adventure through the dangers of facing the meanest creatures and walking through the most adverse places.Ultimately, the tapestry of events which Tolkien brilliantly weaves around Bilbo and his friends confront him with Smaug, the terrible dragon who has long seized the dwarves' treasure. Only the combination of luck, intelligence and a courage which he never thought he had, help Bilbo to sort through all he's faced with to come out as a better being, one that can see beyond the blindness that greed brings into smaller spirits (not necessarily because it affects dwarves more than it affects others in the story). It is there where the true greatness and universal character of the story lies.The best thing about Tolkien's fantasy books is that you can relate to them in so many ways that they no longer seem so distant from what could actually occur to you."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the perfect fantasy book for readers! It has just about all you need to look for: A strong plot with smatterings of suspense, adventure, and mystery, wonderful characters described so well you can almost hear them talking, and a map at the beginning so you can track the journeys of the characters. The plot is this: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, is visited one day by Gandalf, a roving wizard. Although Bilbo insists he does NOT want the adventure Gandalf offers, Gandalf decides that Bilbo is perfect for the job, and brings along thirteen dwarves when next he comes to call. The dwarves are going to go off and reclaim their stolen home(and treasure) from a dragon named Smaug. They set off the very day after their visit at Bilbo's, with Bilbo a nervous and reluctant member of their party. Although Bilbo often wishes to be at home with the kettle singing for tea, he gets none of it as he witnesses Gandalf outsmarting trolls, gets taken down to Goblin Town in the bowels of the Misty Mountains, finds a powerful Ring that makes the wearer invisible, and has to fight giant spiders to save the dwarves. Eventually, all the dwarves are captives of the Mirkwood elves, and Bilbo is trapped inside their castle, always wearing the Ring to avoid discovery. He eventually rescues the dwarves in an ingenious plan: floating them down to the Dragon's mountain in empty barrels discarded by the Mirkwood elves. Bilbo and the dwarves are received ecstatically by the residents of a lake town near the mountain, but soon after Bilbo's birthday they are off to the mountain. Bilbo gets them all inside with a vital clue provided earlier, and drives the dragon nearly mad with frustration. The dragon is eventually slain by a lake townman, who convinces his townsfolk that the treasure is now rightfully theirs. This leads up to a climactic battle of five armies. This is a marvelous book for anyone who needs an escape from life's dreariness. I would recommend it to anyone who is old enough to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Surely, it's been scientifically verified that anyone who gives The Hobbit (and the rest of the series) ONE measly star is, simply, wrong. Tolkien's Middle Earth is rich and perfectly self-contained. He never violates the parameters he establishes for this fantasy world, which he fills with memorable characters and intriquing plot turns. What great escapist literature! I only hope you students who've expressed disdain for this book will later reconsider, and give it another reading. I suspect the circumstances (required reading, homework assignments) may have had more to do with your negative regard for the book than any shortcoming in the storytelling. Consider the (almost) universal positive regard for Tolkien's work. Sometimes the hype is warranted."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I'm looking for reviews of the audiobook. AMAZON, Whazzup? These are all reviews for the book, actually for several different versions of the book. Not very helpful!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I am a Dad who just finished reading this book aloud to my 10-year-old daughter. We took our time and read a little bit each night so it took a couple of months to get through it, because we didn't read every night because of homework and other stuff. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I had lots of time to think about what the book is about. My strongest feeling about this book is that it taught me about how every common person could be a hero. Bilbo is just a common hobbit, but he did some amazing heroic things. Stop and think of his bravery: with the trolls; the Wargs; the spiders in Mirkwood; the dragon. I mean, he is best buds with a wizard for goodness sake! The other important thing to notice is how Bilbo \\"stepped out of the way\\" during the great war that ended the book. Events of the day got too large for Bilbo, so Tolkein gave him a back seat while all the troubles of Middle Earth were solved by Bard, Dain, the Elvenking, the Great Eagle, and the other big boys. This does not diminish Bilbo's accomplishments, he is still a fantastic hero. A true hero does not have to solve all the world's problems. A true hero steps up to the plate when he is called upon, and gets the job done. And that is just what Bilbo did."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a book centered on Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who is briefly seen in 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Return of the King'. Here is the main storyline:Bilbo is living quietly in his hobbithole when Gandalf and thirteen dwarves whisk him away and engage him to travel with them on a journey to the Lonely Mountain to recover the lost treasure of Thorin Oakenshield, the son of Thrain, King Under the Mountain, which has been stolen by a dangerous dragon named Smaug. The fifteen of them hike all the way to the Misty Mountains when they are waylaid by the goblins. While trying to escape from them Bibo gets lost and manages to escape Gollum with a ring that makes whoever wears it invisible(the Ruling Ring in the Lord of the Rings). Then the dwarves and Bilbo journey into the forest of Mirkwood(Gandalf is away, saying that he has some other buisiness to attend to) and there they escape capture by some gigantic, talking spiders and the Elvenking, all by the help of Bilbo's brain and his Ring. Then they finally get to the Lonely Mountain, Mr. Baggins has a few talks with Smaug, then the dragon gets killed(I am not going to say why, for people who dont enjoy spoilers), a few arguments start, and the Battle of Five Armies(Elves, Men and Dwarves vs Goblins and Wargs) takes place. Then Bibo travells with Gandalf back to his hobbithole, and there he lives Happily Ever After(cough, cough).There were more punch lines and funny bits in the Hobbit than in LOTR, which makes sense, because the Hobbit was written by Tolkien as a \\"children's book\\". Still, I really enjoyed the book, and I also liked the personality of Bilbo turning from comfort-loving, adventure-shunning Shire Hobbit to a brave, (some extremely smart)plan-brewing, and rich Hobbit. Also, the book sort of explains how Bilbo got the Ring in a fun way.Which all explains how The Hobbit got five stars, in my opinion:)"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is the beginning of the stories of that race of halflings which is continued in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It begins when Galdalf the Grey visits Bilbo Baggins' home, Bag End, followed within minutes by a company of dwarves. Surprised to find that they have come to include him in their trek to the lair of Smaug, a dangerous dragon, Bilbo at first declines the honor. After all, Hobbits never go on adventures.However, Gandalf has chosen well. Bilbo at last agrees to accompany the dwarves, in itself a most unusual circumstance. But it is not an easy trek they have chosen to undertake. Thirst, starvation, capture, and death await them at every turn. The most dangerous item encountered, however, is a simple gold ring which has not seen the light of day for many years. What will be the price if Bilbo liberates the ring?With The Lord of the Rings movies now being released, this is a wonderful time to revisit the beginning of the Baggins family adventures. For those who have never read Tolkien, his style may be difficult at first. The difficulty of the names may seem daunting. But once readers begin, these will not seem to be barriers. And, like most of those who have read and loved the Hobbits, they will return again and again.All fantasy readers should enjoy both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, as they were the stories on which much modern fantasy is based.

Once I got past the older and awkward narrative viewpoint (in Tolkien's defense, the omniscient point-of-view was in vogue back in 1937, especially for what was considered a children's book), I was reminded of how rich and wonderful the story is. I also realized how classic the tale is on so many levels. Not only is it a prototypical journey tale, but it incorporates all the classic archetypes of fantasy fiction.

However, be that as it may, it was a good read. It started out with a Hobbit (or a small creature) by the name of Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard by the name of Gandalf. The dwarves were in pursuit to avenge their \\"treasure,\\" and needed a \\"burglar\\" (Bilbo Baggins referred by the wise Gandalf). In order to get their treasure, they ran into trolls, elves, wood elves, received some resources for their long journey, and came upon lake people who also aided them in their adventure. At the end, in order to avenge their treasure, that rightfully belonged to them so long ago, they had to fight a dragon named Smaug that doesn't so easily forget when danger is upon him, and he has a very good smell for dwarves. Although they ran into troubles along the way, and they appeared to have gotten their treasure, read more to see whether it was worth it in the end. And see what happens when greed is your number one focus on the prize at hand. Also see how Bilbo Baggins' \\"burgar expertise\\" may save more trouble than is worth in his reward to be received at the end of this journey.

The binding and physical quality of the book is, of course, more than satisfactory. It includes a decent copy of Thorin's map, although it is spread over two pages, and thus some of the center of the map is lost. I would have preferred to see a fold-out map.

Firstly, do not read this book if you're a jaded individual with an inability or unwillingness to appreciate an innocent and charming tale. Secondly, stay away from it if you're a hardcore fantasy reader who began with more modern writers. You'll likely be disapointed (conversely, if you don't generally care for fantasy, you may just love this book, as I did). Finally, don't even attempt to read it if you consider the TV Guide listings to be a challenging read with a complex plot and too many characters.

The reason you are having a hard time understanding it is that you haven't been hitting the books hard enough at school. I first read this book in the 5th grade. I completed reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy by the beginning of the 7th grade. I had no problem at all understanding them. When I didn't know a word, I looked it up in my dictionary. If you are having a hard time now, I feel sorry for you. Do you realize how difficult it will be to get a college education if you are years behind in your reading ability?

I was utterly enrapt from the first page. Enthralled by the sheer genious and subtley of the novel I was compelled to salvage any vacant time by filling it with the adventures of what at first seemed and inapt hero. The sublimity and profound metaphorical meaning are woven with perilous happenings to create a tapesty comperable to such literary feats as a Tale of Two Cities and Siddhartha. I thought it impossible for a writer to render me so unable to set a book down as much as Dumas until I read Tolkien. I never would have believed this novel to be so meaningful before. This book truly astounded me and I, who was so reluctant to even try fantasy, was close to tears when I finished the book and will treat fantasy with alacrity where it was once met with scorn.

The development of Bilbo, and his supporting cast, draw the reader into their lives and adventures like no other fantasy ever written. With the addition of the Lord of the Rings, often mistakenly listed as a trilogy (it was originally written as one book with three parts), the world of Middle Earth continues to evolve and grow, and fall into greater turmoil.

I found the story to be great, it had great great turns and even a couple of (almost) surprising twists; it definitely kept my attention. Tolkien's writing is really good too, I found it fairly easy to read as an ESL person. The only problem I found, and I don't know if it's just me, but - does Tolkien not know how to use his commas very well?Regardless, I think this book is worthy of five stars.

While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic.

I have heard some people say they find it hard to read, but I've never had any trouble with it. As for this particular version of the book, it is easily my favorite. The gold inscription around the front cover is a very nice touch and it goes well with the green. It contains 8 illustrations and two maps which are all colored in black and green rather then the original black and white illustrations. There are also four color plates (colored illustrations) that are in full color. The binding is nice and sturdy and the printing is perfectly clear.

It refreshed the story in my mind as I look forward to seeing the movie by Peter Jackson, due to be released in a few days. This whole story is the pre-courser to the Lord of the Rings, and help that trilogy make more sense as you now know what adventures lead up to that follow-on masterpiece. J.R.R.

It is wonderful to read and looks very good on a bookshelf. The best part is their is no outer jacket that you would be afraid of tearing. You also must realize that Tolkien had this book published in the early 1930s and the story stll lasts to today.

One day a wizard named Gandalf comes to his door and asks him if he'd like to go on an adventure. When he says no, Gandalf scratches a mark into his door that means aster burglar. The next day thirteen dwarves show up at his door, and Bilbo is basically forced to go on the adventure. They explain that they are on a quest to regain their leader: Thorin's gold from the dragon Smaug who stole it years ago, and wish that Bilbo be their burglar( or professional treasure hunter). Their journey starts off well enough, until one night they see a fire and send Bilbo to investigate. He is caught, and the dwarves are also caught, and later Bilbo manages to be thrown into a bush. While in the bush he see's the wizard Gandalf cause the dwarves to argue until dawn, when they turn to stone. The party then travel to Rivendell (where the elves live) with some new swords, and find out that their swords were made during the great goblin wars. They also discovered that the map that Thorin gained had rune letters that told him how to find the secret door. They then head into the misty mountains. When they are taking shelter in a cave, they are captured by goblins, who take them to their king. Once again, Gandalf saves them by killing the goblin king, and allowing them to escape. While they are escaping Bilbo (who could not keep up and had to ride piggy back) falls down into a hole. He found a ring while he was feeling around, but travels further down with the help of his sword (which glows when goblins are near). At the bottom, he finds there is a lake, on the lake lives a creature called Gollum. He has a riddle contest with Gollum and wins, but Gollum plans to slip on his ring (which Bilbo found) and kill Bilbo. Gollum gets mad because he finds out Bilbo has the ring, and starts to chase him. He eventually leads Bilbo to the exit and Bilbo escapes. Soon Bilbo catches up with the rest of them, but soon the party is surrounded by giant wolves. Gandalf tell everyone to get in the trees. Eventually they are rescued by eagles and taken to their nests where they rest for a while. Later on they go to Beorn (a friend of Gandalf's) house. He gives them supplies, and they go into Mirkwood forest. In the forest the company is captured by giant spiders. Bilbo slips on the ring and is able to cut the dwarves free from the webbing and kill the spiders. Later on, they are captured by elves (except for Bilbo) and after a long time Bilbo finally arranges so that they can float downstream in the empty wine barrels that the town makes for the elves. After stopping in the lake town, the company reaches lonely mountain. They finally find the secret door, and when they open it, they find a tunnel into the mountain. Bilbo goes down and steals a cup from Smaug, and later they do riddles. Smaug flies off and attacks the lake town. While Smaug is away they explore the palace, and Bilbo finds the Arkenstone (an important dwarf artifact) and is given Mithril that is very resistant. A man in laketown kills Smaug by shooting an arrow into a weak spot on his chest. After this an army of elves and men go to the mountain to get the treasure, but Thorin refuses. The army lays siege on the dwarves. While this is going on an army of Wargs and an army of Goblins attack the Dwarves, Humans, and Elves. They are saved by the eagles and Beorn. When Bilbo returns home he is rich. The Hobbit by: J.R.R. Tolkein is a very exciting book.This book was very exciting. There were many times when you thought it was over for Thorin and Company and that the story would end there. When they were captured by the Spiders it was very suspenseful, you didn't know if someone would die. It was exciting to watch the battles play out. Many times when you thought they were safe, like when Bilbo almost got stuck in the door when he was escaping the goblins.This book had many details. I almost felt like I was standing in Beorn's house, or searching through the goblin's tunnels. He described Mirkwood very well and it was like you were there. Also a lot of the description was through actions, like when the dwarves chose Bilbo to investigate the trolls fire instead of going themselves.I liked this book because it seemed like it had a history. You could tell that the author put a lot of effort into the history. In one part of the book it tells about Thr Great Goblin wars many years ago. There was a really good story about how the treasure was stolen by Smaug the dragon, and it felt like it had really happened.The Hobbit is a really good book. I enjoyed this book very much, because it kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a really good fantasy novel, and a lot less serious than the Lord of the Rings series. The Hobbit as a exciting, well thought through, detailed, and overall great book.G.Bennett"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This review is targetted at LOTR fans who already know the story and are looking for a collectors' edition.

Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit. Like all hobbits, he has a passion for clothes, food, bright colors (chiefly yellow and green), and second breakfast. And like all hobbits, he wants to be left alone in quiet comfort, not bothered by great, big, stupid people like you or me. However, one good morning Bilbo is visited by the wizard Gandalf who is accompanied by thirteen homeless dwarves. The dwarves have been informed by the clever Gandalf that Bilbo is a burglar and that he can prove extremely useful on an adventure they have undertaken to recover their stolen gold and homes from the evil dragon, Smaug. Through their perilous journey they face blood thirsty wargs (wolves), horrible orcs (goblins), giant spiders, and many other unknown dangers in the dreary, mysterious forest of Mirkwood. Bilbo does end up making a spanking good burglar and despite his reluctantly nervous behavior at times, he saves his companions on more than one occasion. Finally, the fourteen companions make it to the Lonely Mountain, and it is Bilbo, unaided and on his own, who confronts Smaug, \\"the terror of a countryside\\". After the dwarves have regained their treasure, they become slightly greedy and refuse to share it with anyone else. This greed leads to the tragic demise of the Dwarf Lord and the beginning of The Fellowship of the Rings. As the Dwarf Lord dies, his dying words to Bilbo are very significant to note as they are the theme of the book-\\"There is more in you of good than you know...If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Ok, this is one of the most important works of fiction ever written.

Throughout the book artwork is included at the beginning of each chapter, on multiple occasions within each chapter and especially at crucial moments of the story. For first time readers and children especially (Tolkien wrote the book for 8-10 year olds) this significantly aids in the interpretation of Tolkien's succinct and masterfully crafted descriptions of characters, the landscape of Middle Earth and the action scenes too!Tolkien fans and Lord of the Rings (LOTR) Movie fans will know that Alan Lee and another artist were selected by Peter Jackson and used as the principal 'conceptual artists' during the production of the movie trilogy, because he loved their art work and how they had accurately and creatively adapted Tolkien's words to portray his world and mythology. If you have the LOTR 12 disc box set - in the extras DVDs of the LOTR you will see that Alan Lee embraced the movie production beyond what he was employed for and has a true love of all things created by Tolkien and of Middle Earth itself. Alan Lee is a master conceptual artist and with a few quick pencil or brush strokes (e.g. sitting down in the 'proposed set' for the Hobbiton township) he quickly and accurately depicts Tolkien's vision of words into a picture or scene for all viewers to enjoy.This book has a significant number of detailed pencil sketches and superb water-colours of key events, characters and action. I have read this book on my IPAD which allows you to 'zoom-in' on each sketch and colour drawing (I presume the Kindle Fire has the same functionality) and you can interrogate what's happening or what Alan's trying to portray to the reader, in even more detail. Superb reading and enjoyment. Cannot recommend it enough.I also have Alan Lee's 'LOTR Sketchbook' compiled during the production of the LOTR, again another masterpiece of conceptual artwork; I hope as he was employed again as the conceptual artist for the Hobbit Trilogy that he will produce a 'Hobbit Trilogy Sketchbook'."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Sometimes I wish the fantasy genre didnt exist because some people wont read Tolkien because they say they dont like fantasy.

TolkienAs reviewed by Ross RichardWithin the first minutes reading this book, I knew it was going to be one of the best books I have ever read! I think this was a great story. I had to share how I felt about it with all of you. I feel that people who like to read fantasy, or about adventures, would enjoy this book (I recommend reading the back cover before buying the book). My personal reason I enjoyed this book is because it was about an adventure, I love to read about adventures. The story takes place in Middle Earth, in an area called \\"The Shire.\\" The main characters are Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and Thorin Oakenshield. The main idea of this story is about Thorin Oakenshield, a group of dwarves, Bilbo (a hobbit), and Gandalf (a wizard) achieving a quest. The quest is about the group trying to slay a dragon that took Thorin's treasure, and the dangers they encountered.One of the most exciting parts (my opinion) is when Bilbo has a dream about getting kidnapped by goblins and when he wakes up it happens! My favorite part about this book is when Bilbo and the dwarves get kidnapped by goblins and they lose Gandalf! (Gandalf, the wizard, has been protecting and guiding the troop to the destination point, you have to read it to find out). The reason I like this part is because it is very exciting and suspenseful, I couldn't wait to find out what happened.This book was written by J.R.R Tolkien. He also wrote many other books. The best known were the \\"Lord of the Rings series.\\" There are the sequels of what Bilbo's nephew and a group with him accomplish in Middle Earth. I think if you don't like stories that are fiction, to not buy this book, unless your teacher makes you read during the summer!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was a striking book with lots of adventure. I liked it for the most part because it is lighter (not nearly as depressing) than The Lord Of The Rings. The quest of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the thirteen dwarves is exciting and original. Although, at times, the narration often made me feel less involved in the story. I'm not sure i like the way Tolkien writes, he puts too much detail that makes people stray from the point of the story. Overall i thought the book was worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I very much enjoyed this book for two reasons: it is a very good book of classic literature, and the illustrations by Alan Lee are amasing. He has captured the way Tolkien portrayed his characters through words. I think Tolkien would be very happy with what Alan Lee has done to add to Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I found this novel to be well presented in the hardcover format. It is pleasant to look at, and the texture has also made it unique to itself. The print is a good size for the younger readers who are wishing to get into this form of writing.The story itself was great. It gave a lot of insight to how the events surrounding the Lord Of The Rings novels came about. Having read those novels first, 'The Hobbit' answered alot of questions I had. For example; how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, how the red dragon was involved, the trolls and how they turned to stone. Confusion is gone, and there is more understanding about certain events and situations which take place.I feel it is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoyed the 'LOTR' novels and wish to discover more of the journeys which lead to those events taking place. It can be a little hard to get into, but once you are there, everything falls into place and you don't want to stop reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I started to rate The Hobbit 4 stars, but after less than a minute of thought realized this classic work from my favorite writer deserves the 5 star treatment as the prelude to the best story ever told, The Lord of the Rings books.I didn't read the Hobbit as a child like most, it wasn't until I was 20 something that I did, but at the same time I believe this helped me appreciate the it much more.The tale of Bilbo is the ultimate adventure, and one that everyone can enjoy.Frodo lives, and so does Bilbo."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Bilbo Baggins is the main character in J.R.R. Tolkien's classic, The Hobbit. Bilbo is a quiet little hobbit in a quiet little hobbiton until the well known wizard Gandalf approaches him with the opportunity to go on an adventure. Gandalf is all knowing and knows that Bilbo is the hobbit for the job. Bilbo is reluctant but decides to go. He and Gandalf set out with thirteen dwarfs to retrieve an enormous treasure from the dragon Smaug which he stole from the dwarfs long ago. Bilbo faces many dangers along the way such as goblins, trolls, the infamous Gollum, and a couple of overgrown spiders. I have always enjoyed prequels because they show how everything got started. In this story, readers discover where Gandalf gets his magical sword Glamdring and Bilbo's, soon to be Frodo's, glowing dagger Sting. The most obvious is the bit about Bilbo and Gollum and how Bilbo obtained the one ring to rule them all. The narrator gives the story fairly light heartedly, so take it that way. Do not let the lack of seriousness discourage you from reading any more of the book, just take it for what it is. I liked the light heartedness because that is how I write. This is a great book for anyone who enjoys fantasies."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Ok, some you might think that if you saw the three Lord of the Rings movies you know the whole story, but they did not make the very first book a movie.

The best young adult's book of all time, bar none. Sorry Harry Potter fans, but this is head and shoulders above all others. Like the Potter books, it's also great for adults as well. Read the book before you see the movie! From what I've seen, they've taken greater liberties with this movie than they did with LOTR. Galadrial and Legolas, and presumably others, do not appear in this book, and I don't see how, if it took LOTR 3 movies to complete, how can it take 3 movies to do the &#34;Hobbit&#34;?

It takes place in Middle Earth, a fictional land sprawling with all kinds of mythical creatures, lush scenery, and dark secrets. The main character of the story is Bilbo Baggins, an ordinary, unadventurous hobbit who one would never expect to be the hero of a story. He is kind and clever but not very courageous at the start of the story. However, he grows to love adventures and gains courage along the way. The wizard who travels with him is Gandalf, an old but spry man. He is the wise and pushes Bilbo to join them on the adventure. He serves as a kind of guide to Bilbo. They adventure into mountains, hunt for treasure, fight a dragon, and Bilbo finds a mysterious ring and meets a peculiar creature named Gollum. I enjoy reading about Bilbo because he is not your normal hero or adventurer. He spends most of his time at home and doesn't know the first thing about fighting, but he manages to make it along the adventure and uses his wits to get him out of trouble. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of many things. The characters were interesting and likable, especially Bilbo who was a great example of character development. One of my favorite quotes is \\"Please don't cook me, kind sirs!...I'll cook beautifully for you!\\" this is said by Bilbo as three trolls discuss how to cook and eat him. The book has a good resolution even though it is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I give it 5 stars for great characters, story, setting, and the dialogue is witty and enjoyable. The only reason I could see people not liking this book is because it can be slow at parts. With that being said, it makes up for it with incredible detail."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I liked this very much.

The adventure of Bilbo Baggins is the classic treasure hunt, complete with elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls and fire breathing dragon. Also, for the first time the reader meets such characters as Gandalf the Gray, Elrond Half-Elven, Balin, Gloin, and of course Gollum all who play either larger or lesser roles in the Lord of the Rings. Perhaps most importantly, is the account of the finding of the Ring of Power. Therefore, while clearly written with a younger audiance in mind, The Hobbit appeals to readers of all ages, for in it, the master of fantasy can clearly be seen honing the storytelling skills that have won him the praise of millions readers around the world. I can not wait until my neice and nephew are old enough for me to share this incredable tale with them."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a great tale of the change that just a little hobbit can make to the world, and to himself.Bilbo Baggins a small hobbit of hobbiton invited a guest over one day to share a cup of tea. That guest in turn turned into many guests who would pressure him to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.After a dance and a party, 12 dwarves and a wizard (Gandalf) would inform Bilbo that he was to be the burglar on their journey to take the treasure from the great dragon Smaug. After one night Bilbo and the others set out on their journey. They encountered many obstacles but in the end Bilbo could almost always be trusted with the rescue of his group.I like how J. R. Tolkien laid out this story as a great prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy. She explains many main characters as well as the plot very descriptively. She does not, however, explain the significance of the most important item in her series, the ring. She does though display the recent origin and some of its magic.But I think there is a subtle message in this story, the smallest being can make the biggest difference. The small little hobbit, that at one point was scared to leave his smug house, soon emerged to become the great warrior that he was. This Hobbit would still a ring from and out riddle a sea-demon.

I meant to ration myself to one side of a tape per day, but after listening to the first I gave in and listened to the rest nonstop."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The interesting thing about The Hobbit is how close it came to never seeing the light of day. J.R.R. Tolkien's classic children's fantasy book only exists because he was bored while grading his students' papers and accidentally created the mythical creatures known as Hobbits.But I think The Hobbit in particular came into being because Tolkien loved the old fairy tales and myths and couldn't find any contemporary books like the old ones he enjoyed reading. The Hobbit is such a fun book to read that it's almost sinful to admit it. Treasure-hoarding dragons, greedy song-singing dwarves, a jestful old wizard, and the trickssy Gollum all add up to creating a wonderful classic.The Hobbit is a throw back to a much older tradition of fantasy stories than what we're used to nowadays. I recommend this book in particular to everyone familiar with The Lord of the Rings, since it will help to fill in the gaps on what happened before the events in that story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This review does not contain spoilers.If you love the Hobbit, which most do for its enchanting story, and you have the extra few dollars to spend, buy this edition.

For some reason, I just wasn't that interested in the story of how Bilbo retrieved the ring.As it happens, I was \\"forced\\" to read The Hobbit for my college English course at Ohio State this quarter. So not only did I finallly get to read this book, I also got to discuss it in great detail with a bunch of other people. Discussing a book with other people is a great way to have a greater appreciation for the author and the book itself. With The Hobbit, much was discussed about Tolkien's creation of races, and how they fit with a certain social structure of Middle-Earth. Very interesting stuff.I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Hobbit is an amazing piece of literature. But everyone knows that. I think that the LOTR trilogy are better books. Personally, I prefer the darker take in the trilogy than the more lighthearted, jovial tale that is The Hobbit. Bilbo is a great protagonist, as the reader, you grow to love him, and truly want him to escape danger, as you do for all the other characters that went on the journey with Bilbo, to retrieve the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug.Tolkien is a great writer, and the way he plays with being the narrator of the tale is amazing, and makes the story that much more fun to read. Plus, The Hobbit is a book that could easily be read and understood by fairly young kids. And it's a great way to start someone who has never read fantasy novels before.Thank you, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a review about this edition not about the writing, as doubtless if you are considering this particularl edition you have either read the Hobbit or pretty much know the story.This is a beautiful book.

Great edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit written by JRR Tolkien is an adventure fantasy novel in which contains a profusion of courage, adventure and Imagination. These three qualities unite, and create one of the finest adventure novels of all time. Tolkien keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat begging to turn the page by delivering climax after climax in this famous fantasy novel.Tolkien initially grabs the reader with his in depth descriptive writing. His words describe the adventures of Bilbo Baggins so vividly that the reader becomes overwhelmed and begins to believe that he/she is indeed the protagonist. Although Tolkien intended The Hobbit to be a children's novel, the writing is still relevant for all ages. The Hobbit can take any average overscheduled adult away from his/her everyday stresses and return them back to their untainted childhood imaginations. This getaway is created on behalf of Tolkien's fantastically vivid descriptions of landscapes, feelings and characters. Even though the story is completely unbelievable, Tolkien describes everything in such incredible detail that the reader starts to believe that Hobbiton is a real place and being Bilbo Baggins is not fictional anymore.The Hobbit is also a great read because of the never-ending climaxes throughout the book. Tolkien grabs the reader and keeps them captive for an entire novel. It becomes hard to put down the book because you are dawning on another expedition right after you just finished one. One could argue that Tolkien attempted to create a tie between the reader and the protagonist. Tolkien creates this tie through the comparison of Bilbo's sleeping patterns and that of the readers' patterns. Whenever Bilbo has had a long stretch without sleep the reader has not put down the book, however when Bilbo goes to sleep it is in a recession in the story's peaks. For example after Bilbo had left home he had slept very little until he went to Beorns house. This patterning style gives the reader an opportunity to take a rest. This use of literacy makes The Hobbit a very entertaining read.In this novel we meet many different characters, enemy or friend. All of which seemed to be relevant except for the thirteen dwarves Bilbo travelled with. It would seem as though Tolkien added these characters just to aggravate the reader. During the novel these thirteen dwarves who were supposed to be running the show did nothing accept slow the process down by either passing out, getting lost or being captured; with the exception of Elrond, who is able to translate the moon-runes, and Bard, who is able to understand the language of the bird, Roac. Therefore leaving only two practical dwarves. Throughout the novel the reader continuously ask himself or herself \`why doesn't Bilbo just leave these idiots and do it himself?' This question remains unanswered at the end of the novel, in turn leaving the reader irritated. This is indeed a small blunder created by the author, however if he did indeed make these dwarves relevant it would have enhanced the story.All things considered, The Hobbit is a fantastic adventure novel for all ages. It constantly brings the reader out of the frying pan and into the fire. It is truly unbelievable how imaginative Tolkien was. His literary intelligence gives every reader of The Hobbit a reminiscent taste of what it was like as a child with a wild imagination. The novel truly tickles the minds imagination, leaving us believing that everyone should have a little Bilbo Baggins in them."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is not a review specifically of The Hobbit, but more of what this book is compared to Tolkien's other writings. Tolkien's true masterpiece is The Silmarillion, which he wrote in WW1, believe it or not. The Silmarillion is a very deep and complex book, to much so for children. Thus he wrote this book for children taking some bits and pieces from The Silmarillion. You can think of the difference as comparing reading the bible to a bible story for kids. After the success of the Hobbit, Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings which continues from the Hobbit and is somewhat more of a young adult type of work, more complex than the Hobbit but still nothing like the Silmarillion.Does one need to read The Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings? Not necessarily, but I strongly recommend it. There are some parts in the hobbit that some people may find mundane or silly, such as the songs the dwarves sing. But it gives a very good world of what is a Hobbit and if you like that, you'll probably like the Lord of the Rings too. Keep in mind the LOTR is a long series and it seems a character just walking across a field can take 30 pages.On a whole though The Hobbit is certainly one of the best books of all time and can be enjoyed by young and old alike. Obviously now is a great time to read it as the movies are being made of it (finally!). One good thing about reading it is there are some characters not in the movie and of course there are some things in the movie that aren't quite like the book. And you'll have a better idea of what things are going on. But some people may even rather read the book after the movie. I think its more enjoyable to read the book first though, then reread it again later. I also think the book gives you a much better insight into Bilbo than the movie can.

It was harder to feel like I was there in the Hobbit. One can tell that Tolkien has an amazing story going through his mind but he just doesn't quite convey it well on paper, but the reason for the four stars is that you can almost follow his thought process.

The story involves the sudden arrival of a wizard into the quiet village called the Shire. The wizard informs our hero, the hobbit - Bilbo Baggins, that he will be visited soon with a great task. Bilbo soon finds himself involved (not by his choice) in helping a band of dwarfs in an exciting tale of adventure and wonder.We follow Bilbo and the band of dwarfs as they make their way through many perilous areas. Fighting goblins, trolls, and wolves; captured by elves; and finding a dragon. All the makings of an endless tale. It is great to see how the chracter of Bilbo develops. Bilbo is reluctant at first to go on this adventure, but then realizes that one small hobbit can make a difference.This story introduces the reader to the world of Middle Earth. A world full of wonderful and amazing creatures and people. When I first read this story I was captivated by the intricate world that Tolkien had created.

This is the stuff that good fantasy is made out of, and I don't know why Tolkien changed his writing skills when he wrote lord of the rings. Anyways, this book rocks. It's a great book to read next to the fireplace on a rainy night inside your home, and the paintings which are held inside this book, (In other words what Tolkien describes and how he describes it) Is simply and positively extraordinary and different from all other books that I have read, and I've read lots of books. Anyways, get this book. At first, it didn't really seem interesting. But a lot of great books don't immediatly start out interesting. But after the slow parts, it's like a rollar coaster. The lord of the rings, however, was slow all the way through. I'm surprised that people even manage to read all three installments.Anyways, this book is great.

Until *The Hobbit, Part I* becomes available on DVD, I'm posting the film review here.]WARNING: Spoilers ahead!While Gandalf the Wizard [Ian McKellan] remains timeless, it was obvious from the start that the Bilbo Baggins of three *The Lord of the Rings* films fame [Ian Holm, now pushing 80 years old] would have to bow out for the making of *The Hobbit*. Director Peter Jackson had surely asked himself, \\"Who could portray a young Ian Holm?\\", (but not necessarily a younger Bilbo Baggins since we now perceive Bilbo to look like the actor.) Answer: Martin Freeman. And he was right - Freeman effortlessly coalesced into the lead role.In the first of the two *The Hobbit* entries [sub-titled: *Into The Wilderness*], a more youthful Bilbo Baggins is craftily crow-barred by Gandalf into embarking upon a great adventure (Hobbits *despise* adventures!) and by serving as a burglar for a grumbly troupe of thirteen dwarves, all of whom are determined to reclaim their lost family treasure from the Evil dragon, Smaug; however, the actual battle with Smaug at the Lonely Mountain will have to wait until Part II [to be entitled: *Into the Fire*] is released.Part I largely focuses upon the history of the dwarves and the initial hazards that they encounter during their single-minded quest, chiefly battling orcs in the Misty Mountains and finishing with their tribulations with the giant spiders of the vast and ominous Mirkwood forest.It's worth noting right off that the screenwriters very shrewdly rehabilitated the puerile songs of the dwarves [found throughout the book], transforming them into a range of vivid action scenes. This strategy achieved a pair of worthy ends: 1. I've heard audio versions of this story and to include the dwarf renderings of these archaic and lengthy songs would have been in profound conflict with an effective film conveyance. 2. These newly-fashioned scenes provide additional fodder for the artful expansion of the general lack of book material, thereby reinforcing audience interest.Honestly, a movie version of Tolkien's *The Hobbit* could feasibly have been corralled within a single feature-length film [just think of all the ground that was covered inAvatar (Original Theatrical Edition)] -- but the financial anticipations of the producers [greed], which tended to tenon seamlessly with Peter Jackson's lust for detail, had dictated long ago that viewers would have to hang on for a \\"final\\" conclusion. Part I features an ending of a sort but perhaps it would be more forthright to regard it as a dramatic finale.One looming uncertainty which has kept Tolkien fans off-balance was whether the screenwriters would go dark with *The Hobbit* in an effort to effectively link it up withThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)series, particularly since Tolkien originally penned the earlier work as a sort of kids' fairy tale. In retrospect the answer to the question was probably evident to Peter Jackson from his earliest conception of a film version, noting additionally that his time-honored philosophy is that first-class films cannot simply mirror the books from which they are taken. A good screenplay massages a book for all it's worth but the visual and audio aspects must be fully accommodated too.Particular figures such as Gandalf, Elrond [Hugo Weaving], Galadriel [Cate Blanchett] and, Gollum [Andy Serkis] have already been firmly established in terms of image and it would be less than prudent at this juncture to radically manipulate the personalities of these prominent returning characters. And speaking of Galadriel, she was never a personage to be found in *The Hobbit* but Peter Jackson mined her from Tolkien's trilogy, casting her very strategically in his film version (along with Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom who also did not appear in *The Hobbit*) to further expand the script. Blanchett's presence additionally helped to overcome the gender gap of the book version. Still, these two actors are not in any way just add-ons -- their respective roles and performances have imparted considerable gravity to the story.It is impossible to separate this film's noir-ish ambiance from Howard Shore's magnificent soundtrack. He's done it again! Upbeat and even a bit frivolous at the outset, the filmscore soon slips furtively into darker realms as the story advances, a few heroic themes being reserved for the appropriate dramatic moments. One is acutely taken with the leitmotif which Shore appended to Beorn, a Prokofiev-ish ponderousness integrated with a more serious Beethoven-like dignity... the perfect musical emulsion for the venerated skin-changer.Once initial New Zealand and Australian actors' guild stumbling blocks were surmounted, the Kiwi locations again became a reality, a twin-island geography wholly adequate for the production when supplemented by studio settings, all of which have lead to the presentation of an astonishingly exceptional end-product. It would certainly have proven problematic to reproduce The Shire's Hobbiton in Eastern Europe, a location which was suggested during the early union-troubled days.Martin Freeman's dazzling performance has eclipsed even that of Elijah Wood's stellar lead role in *The Lord of the Rings* films. The former's ebullient energy ironically seems to have retrospectively amplified Ian Holm's earlier portrayal of Bilbo in the New Line Cinema trilogy of films. The remaining cast members have also set the viewers at complete ease as they creatively played out their respective roles. Peter Jackson undoubtedly learned early in his career that, given spot-on casting, at least half the battle is won. And it's hardly surprising that a particular limelight shines on Fili [Robert Kazinski] and Kili [Aidan Turner] since this caveat, for those of us who already know the story, will markedly impact most of us when we get to view the second film. The director is clearly looking ahead.In the larger view *The Hobbit* story lacks the bulwark of heroic figures which we encountered throughout *The Lord of the Rings* series, Aragorn, Boromir, Theoden, Faromir, and so on. Still, imposing characters such as Elrond, Beorn, and Bard the Bowman provide us with a subliminally more-than-adequate melodramatic security blanket. The bottom line is that this superb movie is not simply the detritus of *The Lord of the Rings* films. It's gratifying that Peter Jackson was shrewd enough to not endeavor upon such a futile follow-up attempt -- he created this film from scratch. Embracing that same notion, the screenwriters saw to it that the storyline endured sufficient jumbling so that the tale is not precisely as linear as the one we encounter in the book. This film stands on its own.With better than a baker's dozen of little folks in starring roles the temptation to over-incorporate moments of comic relief [vignettes of Gimli] must have rivaled the gnawing urge which only The One Ring could normally generate. While some tasteful levity fell well within the bounds of a palatable script, I did actually breathe a sigh of relief once I realized that few such incidents were forthcoming.The computer generated images aspect of the movie, while perfectly executed and integral to the overall work, are nicely supplemented by scale doubles, forced perspective images, miniatures, and other Jackson-ish tricks of the trade. No fear -- these facets of the film are all first-class and delightfully palatable. Gollum is better than ever. Additionally, due accolades can hardly be suitably imparted to all the folks who helped to polish this film to excellence by means of effective make-up, articulate stunt work, unequaled cinematography, precise production design, and all the other crew activities which only ever seem to rate a fleeting line of scrolled credit.One is pleased to observe that the new role of Warner Brothers and MGM [Hollywood-based companies which recently acquired New Line Cinema] did not perceptibly obstruct Peter Jackson's proclivity for artistic detail. The casual but essential impedimenta present at every place where the Dwarfish Crusaders land aids us all to subconsciously believe in the reality of Middle Earth along with its numerous and varied inhabitants. Probably much credit for the focused attention upon the near-infinite number of magical nuances should go largely to Alan Lee, a man with an unbounded imagination coupled with a vast artistic talent.I present only a singular critique of this film and it has nothing to do with the body of the movie itself: I feel compelled to comment that the decision to incorporate the endless scroll of Tolkien Fan Club members' names within the end credits is ill-advised and indirectly demeaning to the actual cast and crew. What do these people actually contribute to the film's production? Loyalty and moral support? The folks who have indeed delivered something more tangible are appropriately noted elsewhere within the credits. But most of the listed individuals have played no real part whatever, regardless of the syrupy patronization conducted by the film-makers toward this particular faction of Tolkien enthusiasts. Including these names in the film credits, which also takes in the so-called self-appointed \\"guardians\\" of Tolkien's work [a trivial minority of Tolkien Fan Club members], amounts to little more than a shallow ego-bribe. It's presumptuous as the devil to assert that Tolkien's books *need* guarding by anyone -- the affiliation here is more akin to pretentious posthumous tail-gating on the venerable Old Master.The credits perquisite imparted by the film producers, appears in my view to ostensibly head off any whining outrage raised on the internet by those Tolkien radicals who are wholly unyielding in regard to the slightest manipulation of Tolkien's texts. This posture is pure nonsense. In the end, if one's name is included in the film credits then how can s/he ever issue an untainted appraisal of the film? In truth, such an individual could never ethically issue a fruitful critical review, (nor would they likely be *inclined* to criticize, which leads me to question the motives and ethics of the producers on this front.) But here I ramble witlessly upon a topic which only faintly deserves to be dignified by my attentions to it. In truth, my mini-rant is not even a legitimate film criticism - it's really just a pet peeve.In summary, *The Hobbit* contains enough MacGuffins and other surprise moments to make it seem like a new story while still paying a more than adequate tribute to Tolkien's original manuscript. Martin Freeman was surely a brilliant choice to play Bilbo.

The quest has been in literature for hundreds of years, it is seen in Beowulf when he goes off to kill Grendel and it is also very much so present in the Arthurian Legends. The biggest quest in Arthurian Legend would have to be the quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur and his knights think that if they bring home the grail then a time of peace and prosperity will fall over their lands. Bilbo sort thinks the same way when he takes the cup from the dragon; he thinks that by having proof of his exploits that will make him an even more recognizable figure among the other hobbits.Another interesting parallel in The Hobbit to Arthurian Legend is use of named swords. It is with his sword Excalibur that Arthur was able to derive a lot of his power. The same goes for Bilbo after acquiring his short sword from the trolls, he does not name at first knowing that he has to prove himself with it but after that he names it Sting. It is with this sword that Bilbo was able to feel his own powerAlthough Tolkien publicly denied any connections between The Hobbit and Arthurian Legend it is defiantly easy to see where people are able to see parallels and connect the two stories together. Overall The Hobbit is a great read it does not take long to finish and interesting to see the differences between the movie and book. Everyone should read The Hobbit at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I love Tolkien's book The hobbit.

I would recommend the book you if you love mystery books. it's a great thrilling book"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I started reading \\"The Hobbit,\\" I was so bored. I never thought I could finish reading it and actually enjoy it. Around the sixth chapter, \\"The Hobbit\\" picked up the pace and became interesting. It surprised me that I was actually entertained by reading the book. At the conclusion, I was pleased with the action and the adventure. I was content with the ending also.One of the best parts of \\"The Hobbit\\" was not the quest to Lonely Mountain, but watching Bilbo Baggins' transformation. Throughout the book, he developed from a timid hobbit to a smart, stealthy, and more confident hobbit. I liked seeing how his adventures, especially the encounter with the spiders in Mirkwood, positively changed his character. I also enjoyed when Bilbo cleverly came up with a way to escape from Thranduil's imprisonment. The idea of riding down the river in old boxes and barrels was resourceful. He benefited from the quest in ways more profound than leaving with a chest of silver.One of my favorite adventures in the story was when Bilbo met Gollum. I loved when Gollum and Bilbo were engaged in the riddle game. The terms of the game made it more intense to me. If Bilbo happened to get a riddle wrong, Gollum was going to eat him. Personally, I believe it was one of the most important points in the novel. Here, Bilbo finds the amazing invisibility ring that helps him greatly throughout the rest of the quest to Lonely Mountain.J.R.R Tolkien used foreshadowing throughout the novel. The use of foreshadowing made the story more engrossing. When he used foreshadowing, I became more entrenched in reading. Tolkien knew exactly what words and phrases to use to paint a vivid image in my head. Throughout \\"The Hobbit,\\" I felt like I was actually on the adventure with Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs. Without the frequent foreshadowing and the dynamic imagery, I personally would not have been as interested throughout \\"The Hobbit.\\"I would most definitely recommend this book to everyone. While it is challenging to read the first few chapters, once the real adventures begin, you will not be able to put the book down. As someone who does not usually read and enjoy adventure or fantasy novels, I am surprised that I enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" so much."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The hobbit is a very good read.

During their entire campaign and travels they encounter much fighting and peril that ends up in an all out war with a surprise ending.

Tolkien book on the market. Being a huge fan of Tolkien's work, I have read just about every book there is to offer, and have not found one yet that is better than The Hobbit. The book starts by introducing you to a boring, normal hobbit that has no idea he will someday be one of the most famous hobbits ever. While sitting down to his usually noon tea he gets a knock on the door and opens it to find a pair of dwarves standing outside. Being his freindly self he invites them in for a cup of tea. Before long the door has been opened 6 times revealing a total of 12 dwarves that are all seeming to be of some relation. By the time Bilbo (the hobbit) knows what is going on, his tookish side gets the best of him, and he is swept out the door on an adventure of a lifetime. On the way Bilbo discovers their quest is to kill off a dragon that has taken their ancestors mountain along with all the treasures inside. Bilbo is quite pleased when he finds out his reward will be one fourteenth of treasure. Along the way, however, the group faces many hardships, dangerous encounters, and deadly battles. This book keeps you on your toes and guessing what is going to happen next. Unlike other Tolkien books I found it to be quite humouros. There are not as many battles as in the lord of the rings series, but there are just as many near death encounters. Overall this was probably the best book I have read in months, because of Tolkien's ability to make you believe that this could have actually happend. If you have read any other Tolkien book and enjoyed it, you will love this book! My advice to you is to purchase The Hobbit today and discover the mystical world of Middle Earth!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I was never in to Lord of the Rings Or J.R.R. Tolkien until I saw the movie. I didn't like the movie very much until my friend brought it over and let me hold it. I instantly fell in love with it. And felt that I was almost forced to Buy Tolkien's Literary works. After much and much hesitition, I knew that I was bound to like the book so I said why not go all out and buy this GREEN LEATHERETTE HOBBIT, AND THE LORD LORD OF THE RINGS RED LEATHERETTE.editions of the book.I read the Hobbit in 6 days. The book starts off very entertaing but later on becomes rather dry. However not dry enough to make it unbearable.The Green Leatherette edition is 317 pages, and about 4 full color glossy drawings, and as well as about 10 or more other drawings. The Drawings are not bad, especailly since they were drawn by Tolkien himself who is known for his writing skills not his drawing skills. The book becomes dry when they leave the wood elf spot, and they have to go through mirkwood, where there are many spiders and other creatures. The book then picks up later when they arrive at Loneley mountain, the end of the book, where they have to steal the treasures from the Dragon Smaug who guards the treasures. Which is about 60 pages of the book, completely on the part with Smaug and before Smaug dies.The book I would reccommend to people between the ages of 5-?? the book is very good, and should be read by all readers of all ages.The book has illustrations but does not need them to help the story progress, I could litterally sit there and draw out the things described with out being bored, as other books do.The book has nearly no violence and is a very light hearted adventure of a \\"hobbit\\" Bilbo Baggins who never went on any adventures or unexpected events, but with his meeting up with the Wizard \\"Gandalf The Grey\\" he tells Bilbo about going on a quest that will make him rich. The next day, Gandalf comes back with the Dwarves who Bilbo will spend his adventure with and tells him everything(or not so much as everything).The quest starts simple enough and seems like a typical fantasy( which J.R.R. Tolkien is the author who spawned the genre as a whole) Bilbo is hired as a burglar to accompany a group of thirteen Dwarves to the Loneley mountain. Once at the Loneley mountain Bilbo will have to pilfer the Dragon Smaug of all his un needed treasures. The book starts simple but ends with many hardships and is very enjoyable, readers 5-12 highly reccomended,but other age groups don't expect much violence."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Geoff MMay 19, 2003I read the book called The Hobbit. I was very interested in reading this book after I watched The Lord of the Rings movies that came out in theatres. I feel that this book had an ideal audience ages 12 and up. The concept of the book is made for a younger audience but there are some things in the book that make it for an older audience. The book references drinking and smoking which to little kids is not a big deal but some may think that younger kids are not suited for that kind of stuff.This book was full of literary techniques; the first example is imagery. Imagery is found throughout the book and in fact is on the first page of the book. The author does a great job of describing the characters traits and it paints a picture in the readers mind. Imagery is also used when the main character Bilbo is walking through the forest, the author paints the pictures of the forest through the use of imagery. Even though imagery is good in a book sometimes the author put to much detail in little things such as spending two pages describing the pony. The other literary technique used by the author was the use of personification. The author seemed to make everything in the book come to life. The best example I can thing of was when Bilbo met the little creature named Gollum. Gollum lived in the cave and when he ran from Bilbo he jumped into the water and the author described the water as running away from the shore. As we all know, water can not run thus the author was using personification to give the water human traits.This book had me so caught up in the rich plot; I couldn't even put it down. My emotions were mixed when I was reading it. At first I thought it was an adventure and then the book took my emotions and changed them because the characters ran into so many different challenges. My reactions to the book were good, but I thought that the whole story line was too quick. What I mean is that the stories plot seemed a little to quick to seem real. My overall impressions of this book were good. I liked the story line and I loved how the book ties in close with The Lord of the Rings movies. Before reading this book I was a little worried because it was a classic book and I thought right away that the book would be boring. I recommend this book to anyone who likes the fantasy world type of stories and people who liked The Lord of the Rings movies. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars and I feel that everyone needs to read this classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Bilbo Baggins, a small, unimpressive creature called a hobbit, embarks on an adventure that will change the world of Middle Earth forever. In The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien begins to weave the greatest fantasy story in literary history. Blibo lives in his cozy little hobbit hole, far away from any danger, in a place called the Shire. Life is peaceful for the Hobbits, especially Bilbo, but his peace won't last. When Gandalf and Thorin and Co. pay the little hobbit a visit and offer him the adventure of a lifetime, Gandalf goads the little hobbit into joining the dwarves' adventure. The dwarves (Thorin and Co.) plan to march to the Lonely Mountain where they will smite the dragon Smaug and reclaim their ancient treasure under the mountain. Gandalf had told the dwarves that Bilbo would go as their burglar, when in fact Bilbo was far from a burglar. As the group of fourteen treks towards the Lonely Mountain, Tolkien uses the timid hobbit, in various adventures, to convey how even the smallest being can become a hero to all. Tolkien made a comprehensive history to his stories, which makes the story feel real, like it actually happened. By never switching characters and always concentrating his writing on the hobbit, Tolkien creates a story that flows exquisitely. It captivates the mind, and Tolkien's descriptive writing makes the reader feel like he or she is actually there with the hobbit on his marvelous adventure.By: Joseph Hill"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, or even gruesome may make a good tale, and take a great deal of telling anyway.\\"In The Hobbit, Tolkien has created his own world independent from our own. The fictitious Middle Earth is complete with its own history and family trees. Set in a time before Men are the reigning species, The Hobbit is unlike any other fantasy novel.

Tolkien, chronicles the travels of Bilbo Baggins and his troop of dwarves. The overall setting is in the fictitious world of Middle-Earth. The story begins in the Shire at Bilbo's home and journeys through opaque labyrinths and inscrutable wilderness. The wizard, Gandalf, directly foreshadows the role of Bilbo in this book, and why he was included on this perilous quest, with the statement, \\"Bilbo is stronger than you or he knows.\\" Bilbo, while skeptical of his abilities, proceeds to prove his worth and valor again and again. Throughout the book, the virtues of courage and intelligence are shown to greatly influence the outcome of any predicament. Bilbo, an unlikely representative of good, triumphs over evil. Hordes of mythical beasts, such as goblins, trolls, evil wolves, giant spiders, and mischievous elves all oppose Bilbo and company in their quest for the Lonely Mountain. The areas of the journey in which there is darkness are always associated with evil. In the end, it is Bilbo all alone, and he is forced to demonstrate a courage previously unknown to him as he faces the personification of evil, the great dragon Smaug, guardian of the Lonely Mountain. One of the few grievances I have with this novel is the lack of complexity in the characters.

He is invited to go on a journey with thirteen dwarves who are going to their homeland to reclaim the land and their gold.

A wizard named Gandalf helps Bilbo and the dwarves on their journey. Bilbo acts as a burglar for the dwarves and rescues the dwarves in a lot of situations. The dwarves lead the way to the mountain to get the gold. Gandalf acts as a protector and advice giver to Bilbo and the dwarves. The characters run into a lot of trouble and adventures in the story. Each trouble is an adventure in the story like when the dwarves get caught by bad guys like goblins and spiders. They also fight a big battle with five armies. In all of the adventures Bilbo rescues the dwarves. My favorite character in the story was Gandalf because he was very powerful, and he was very wise.I can't really relate to any of the characters, except Bilbo, because he likes to stay at home all by himself. I also like to stay by myself too, so I can do whatever I want without anyone telling me what to do. I really liked the book; I thought the book was very imaginative. My favorite part of the book was at the beginning when the author described Bilbo's house in detail as if I were really there looking at it.

His relaxed life-style, however, is interrupted by the magician Gandalf who enlists Bilbo as a thief. Reluctantly Bilbo sets out on a pilgrimage with 12 elves to recover a stolen treasure from a dragon. While trying to accomplish their mission, the unlucky crew encounters countless adventures imbued with life-threatening dangers. Exceeding the elves' expectations, Bilbo becomes of great use in these predicaments. The final bloody battle is the climax of the book.The alluring story line is something that will be parted with reluctance. However lighthearted the novel is, there is some profound symbolism and allusions to real facts. e.g. The final battle in the book is a blatant reference to the events of World War One, through which Tolkien has lived. He was obviously against it, as he demonstrates that myriads of decent, innocent people were obliterated. Also, basically the whole book reverberates the theme of maturing, demonstrated in Bilbo as he transforms from a timid creature to a more heroic persona.Overall:This is a beautifully written book. The writing style used by Tolkien is commendable. The word choice is charming and amiable. The overall style is simple and lucid, but very enthralling and captivating. Definitely something that can be read for leisure. The same can be said of the story-line. It is very solid and well-knit together, there probably isnt a single loophole to taint its value. Filled with wonderful tales of magic and adventure it is second to none in the fantasy class. One of those childhood books that will be fondly remembered later in life.

The graphic novel does a nice job of adapting Tolkien's approach to \\"The Hobbit.\\"We have an animated version of \\"The Hobbit\\" and a live action version of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for comparison to this novel. In general, Wenzel's illustrations are reasonably good. My only complaint is that some of the perspective views of the Bilbo made him appear too thin. I also note that Bilbo appears just a little cartoonish as compared to the other characters, which compare very favorably to director Peter Jackson's film characters. Perhaps species is a better term, since only a few characters from \\"The Hobbit\\" appear in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"While I am happy to have this graphic novel, I have already read \\"The Hobbit\\" several times and plan to read it again in the coming year. This graphic novel is not a substitute for Tolkien's prose. I recommend reading that book before purchasing this graphic novel because there is much more detail and much to enjoy in the Tolkien original. Though this graphic novel stands on its own, it is much like reading an abridged version of the original.In the realm of versions of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the original remains the best. However, I think this graphic novel is superior to the 1977 Rankin-Bass animated version. Regardless of which format you have, they are all worth enjoying if you are a fan.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is just good clean fun, delightful for children and adults. If you've read LOTR and wondered how Bilbo got the ring, here's the story. I enjoyed Tolkien's omnicient narrator style in this book --somewhat like Thackeray's Vanity Fair, and more recently Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell-- which I suppose he adopted because he was writing for children. I think it's charming.I highly recommend the audiobook, read by Rob Inglis. He's a Royal Shakespeare company actor and the best audiobook reader I've ever heard (and I've heard a lot of them). He has a different voice for each dwarf, and he does a great Gollum, too. He actually sings the songs (nice voice!) and he even belches up ponies. The scene with the trolls is especially well-done. Mr. Ingliss could probably make one of Terry Goodkind's later books sound exciting, but The Hobbit actually is exciting and I highly recommend it for adults and kids.--FanLit.net"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I read this for the first time as an adult and will forever lament that I did not grow up with this story. I had seen the animated movie but thought I should start reading Tolkien at the beginning, so I picked up my dad's copy of The Silmarillion. Not a great choice for me at ~10 years old, as I was used to reading Judy Blume and Beverly Cleary at that time.I didn't try Tolkien again until I was an adult and looked over my husband's illustrated copy of The Hobbit, gifted by his school-teacher aunt and uncle when he was a child.I have devoured JRRT's works since then. That's how good The Hobbit is."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It's difficult to decide where J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit ranks among the all-time greatest works of fantasy literature. In a manner of speaking, guilt by association is to blame (or thank). A major factor in the success of The Hobbit is its connection with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The tale of the burglar Bilbo and his Dwarven compatriots' journey to find and slay the dragon Smaug acts as a prelude to Rings, and as such has developed a very unique stigma - it can almost be labeled the black sheep of Tolkien's fantasy universe, relying on The Lord of the Rings for its fame. The original edition of The Hobbit, released in 1937, was even altered to better match the storylines developed in the more recognized Rings series. However, despite these changes (which may or may not have been necessary), The Hobbit is a top-notch fantasy epic through and through. From Gandalf's battle with the mighty cave trolls for Elvish treasure, to Bilbo's battle of wits with the creature Golum, all the way to the Battle of Five Armies, the story is consistently energetic and the characters remain warm and welcoming throughout. What makes The Hobbit truly unique to this day is Tolkien's ability to use the setting of Middle Earth as a tool to weave a story that is unique in its intentions, but parallel to the fantasy epics it sets up.Many aspects of The Hobbit evolved out of the beliefs and knowledge of its author. J.R.R. Tolkien was an extremely educated man. He was the professor of Anglo-Saxon language and English language and literature at Oxford University for thirty-four years. All of his works of literature reflect his love of language - modern and historical, real and invented (including the beloved Elvish tongue). Tolkien's works were influenced by English and Celtic lore, and Norse and Finnish mythology, but above all he was influenced by a devout belief in Roman Catholicism, as evident by the Christian theology sprinkled throughout his works. This is evident at the close of The Hobbit when Bilbo renounces the treasure offered him at the end of his quest because he has no practical use for too much gold. In other words, he already had everything he needs at The Shire in his warm hobbit hole.One of the many timeless aspects of The Hobbit is its approachability. People of all ages have read and fallen in love with Tolkien's prelude. This speaks volumes as to the narrative voice with which Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit, a wizard, and thirteen grumbling dwarves. The language used to convey the story is very simple and yet paints a perfect picture in the reader's mind. For example, the riddles Bilbo uses to trick Golem out of his \`precious' ring are complex enough to dupe the readers (along with Golem), and yet simple enough to warrant thoughts of \\"oh man, I should have known that!\\" In a genre as imagination-driven as fantasy, being able to clearly visualize a world as vivid and complex as Middle Earth is essential to both the plot and the characters, and it is one of the strongest aspects of The Hobbit.Tolkien's method of storytelling is very similar to the way he employs simple language. Like an inverted funnel, everything starts off simple enough in Bilbo's hobbit hole in The Shire, but it doesn't take long for the characters to find their way into situations that compound upon one another as the story moves along. Without the reader even noticing it, Tolkien takes Bilbo and the dwarves from smoking tobacco in the large region of Eriador to the horrific events at the Battle of Five Armies - that is, from a nothing to an epic. This pacing is best represented towards the book's conclusion when all manners of Goblins and Wargs are closing in on the dwarves, humans, and elves that have taken refuge in the halls of the Misty Mountain. Just as all the energy of the war seems primed to take the book beyond its typical \`micro-epic' feel, Bilbo is knocked unconscious, and wakes only after the battle has been concluded. This type of transition is so smooth that, like the book itself, the scope of the War might not be comprehensible to readers until they have completely finished reading the aftermath.It's a very hard task to find fault in one of the greatest works of fantasy fiction ever written. In fact, the only way to find shortcomings of any kind is by comparing it to the few books in the genre that may have had better reception from the public - including The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter just to name a couple. In this way, once again, it's guilt by association for Tolkien's The Hobbit. The three volume Rings series is the quintessential fantasy epic - well-written characters from all different backgrounds and races traverse alien lands and face unimaginable foes so that they can save the world and their way of life. While some of those elements are present in The Hobbit, they certainly aren't to the same extent that they are explored in Rings. For example, the reader doesn't find out that any piece of land in Middle Earth is in peril until all but the end of Hobbit, whereas Rings is totally devoted to saving the world by destroying the One Ring. Up until the war in The Hobbit, Bilbo, Thorin and his dwarves want nothing more than to find and reclaim a long lost material wealth.In the end, a reader should never have to choose between any of Tolkien's works - they are all special, all brilliant, and, especially in the case of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, they all complement each other. And while The Hobbit may not have the truly epic feel of Rings, it does achieve a level personal interaction with the reader that the sprawling, conquering epic cannot match."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Very entertaining I read it for school and loved it.

It is a fun fantasy adventure story which can be enjoyed by younger adults and older adults equally. Current Amazon Product Page recommendation is for \\"ages 12 and up\\" and \\"grades 7 *and up*\\" and this seems appropriate. Please do not be intimidated by the aura of JRR Tolkien and the stature of his 2 main works (The Hobbit andThe Lord of the Rings: One Volume). The Hobbit has not stood the test of time due to praise from critics or from analysis by scholars. It has stood the test of time because it is loved by fantasy readers of all ages. Please do not let the upcoming movie delay your enjoyment of the book. Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job creating cinematic versions of the Lord of the Rings and I fully expect him to do so with the Hobbit as well; However, I strongly recommend to READ THE HOBBIT NOW which will allow for greater enjoyment and understanding of the movie later.The Hobbit has long been a favorite story of mine; an old friend who might not always be at hand but is never forgotten. Fortunately, it is now available as an e-book so it is easier to keep track of. This is the story of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is living a comfortable and predictable life in the Shire until Gandalf, a wizard, decides that Bilbo is needed to assist 13 dwarves on their quest. Bilbo will join the quest as a burglar based solely on Gandalf's recommendation and no prior experience. Bilbo is dumbfounded to find that he is expected to travel through goblin and troll infested lands to confront a dragon that has stolen the dwarves' rightful treasure. It is great fun to follow Bilbo's transformation from a homebody to a dauntless adventurer while never losing track of his roots. The enhanced version contains additional drawings which are interesting but probably mainly of interest to longtime fans. The enhanced version also contains some audio content (Tolkien reading passages or reciting poetry or songs) which I could not access through my Kindle (only compatible with Ipad and Iphone).This is a must read story for those who are fans of the YA Fantasy Genre. The Hobbit (Enhanced Edition) is 4,956 Kindle locations long excluding sample of The Lord of The Rings. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. Longer novels, such as those in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.Update December 2012: I was not able to access the bonus audio content with my Kindle Fire HD.

Many people have exhaustively reviewed and analyzed these stories, as well as the differences that resulted from the printing of each edition of these books over the years. I am going to do neither. Not only am I not knowledgeable enough, I'm not interesting in becoming knowledgeable enough to do so.This review is for people like me - people who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings films and are looking forward to the new Hobbit films and are perhaps interested in reading the books, as they have never done so previously. So is the book as great as people say it is? Well, yes. However, personally I didn't think it was perfect. Make no doubts about it, this book was written for a young audience. By no means does that mean adults won't enjoy it, but it's something to note. I tried reading The Hobbit as a child and gave up on it quickly. Tolkien narrates the book as if he is sitting at a campfire telling you a story. The narrator converses with the reader outside of the story - a style I've never really been fond of.Additionally, certain elements of the story can be odd at times. In a book with characters named Bilbo and Gandalf, the Trolls who try to eat the main characters at the beginning of the book are named Bert, Tom, and Bill. Also, there are a lot of talking birds here - which I find a bit ridiculous even for a fantasy book. Tolkien trys to justify why the main character Bilbo, a non adventureous type, would go on a adventure and it never seems believable. That aside, the story is amazingly entertaining. There is a ton of content here. From encounters with Trolls and Goblins, magic rings and Elves, Dragons and stolen treasure, to a battle of Five Armies (which is actually Six Armies if you count the talking birds). I can see why the filmmakers have decided to split this book into two Hobbit movies.Anyone who is considering reading The Hobbit - you should. It's a classic and everyone should see for theirselves what they think of it. Personally, I am always disappointed when a Kindle version of a book is more expensive than a physical copy. This Kindle copy was $10.99 at the time of purchase. You can order paperback copies of the book for a few dollars less. However, there are many different editions of this book, each with slight differences and this Kindle version is the 50th anniversary - supposedly the most up to date. I can't say for sure, but for a novel as amazing as this, I feel as if I definitely got my money's worth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I realize that are a thousand reviews for this book already, but since The Hobbit is one of my all-time favorite novels, I simply have to throw in my two cents worth. This is a great prelude to The Lord of the Rings, for many reasons. First of all, it's compact and fast paced, somewhat unlike LOTR, but it gives a fine glimpse of the magic of Tolkien's world. To me, this is really the first book of LOTR and an essential part of the series. If you've read LOTR but not The Hobbit, then you simply have not read the complete LOTR. Simple as that.This is a delightful book of high fantasy, aimed at young adults but still plenty satisfying to grownups. The characters are solid and interesting, and the setting is pure magic. The book draws you in from the opening lines and keeps you immersed in Tolkien's fantasy world until the very satisfying conclusion. Yes, it's a book featuring dwarves, elves, a staff carrying wizard, some common fantasy monsters, and so on and so forth. But Tolkien was the one who spawned the \\"usual\\" fantasy elements, and so for its time the book was quite original. And regardess, the book is just flat-out entertaining and maintains a unique feel. Even if you've read many modern fantasy books, The Hobbit will stand out from the crowd.Setting: 10 of 10. A magical experience throughout. Characters: 9 of 10. The characters work well for the book, though a few of the dwarves are underdeveloped. Plot: 9 of 10. Simple, yet effective. Just good fantasy fun. Pacing: 10 of 10.

Tolkien, has taken on a life of it's own. From its first publication in the late 1930's as an obscure children's tale written by a little known professor of Anglo-Saxon history that, as the story goes, grown greatly as time passed. A pop culture fad of the 60's and 70\`s morphed into the basis of the blockbuster films by Peter Jackson and its own films in the near future, (sure to also be blockbusters). Professors Tolkien's Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves have become a fixture and icon of Western Culture. I find it fascinating that he, (Tolkien) remarked to a friend, in 1937 that, \\"I don't much approve of, The Hobbit, myself....\\". I think it's possible that he changed his mind as the years went on.I wont go into reviewing the story that so many others already know by heart and that others have spoken of at nausea, other than to say that it is a great book for both children and adult's, nuff said.I will however, say a bit about this Edition. I have been lusting after this Edition of The Hobbit ever since I was sale's clerk at a Walden's in the early 1970's. I think that even then it cost around $20. For those of you who can't recall any President prior to a Bush or Clinton, let me tell you, when you're 16 years old and making just under $2 an hour, that was a sum that only old Smaug himself could afford. This edition is beautifully bound and printed. The illustrations and drawings could be considered a bit unspectacular by today's, \\"razzal-dazzle\\", standards but, they are none the less very enchanting in their own right and done by the author, I think that counts for something. The hard cover box/sleeve that the work comes in both protects the volume and does nothing that detracts from its beauty. If you ever have an evening to spare, translate the ruins that encompass the book, it's a bit of an inside joke. This is a work of heirloom quality. I am greatly looking forward to reading this beautiful edition to the prolific number of grandchildren that our children have produced and seem to drop off with greater regularity, :)All and all this work and this edition come very highly recommended.Spence the Elder\\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"-M.

The Hobbits have perfectly boring and perfectly happy existances in their cozy homes. That was what Bilbo Baggins had, at least, until the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. Now Bilbo (without, of course, having ever been asked for his consent) is going on an adventure to retrieve the dwarves' gold from the dragon Smaug.J.R.R Tolkein's writing is literally beautiful. Every little song and ditty he includes in his books is well-thought-out and fantastic. The plot moves along at a good pace and it is the right combination of peril, adventure and magic, and, in the Hobbit, there's a bit of the whimsical factor too.I advice every fantasy lover to read the Lord of the Rings series if you haven't already, and I especially suggest to read the Hobbit.

In 2012 I wrote a new review, and am editing my original text to include this new review. Mike London 10-3-2012]New Review 2012: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature. For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a sequel to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"\\"The Marvellous Land of Snergs (Dover Children's Classics)\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character (for though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life experience to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past.Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others).This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicitly prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistencies between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature.-----Original Review 2000: \\"Inferiour to L.R.? I think not! No, just different!\\"The biggest problem with this novel is perception. Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children. There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that was his master achievement in children's literature.The Lord of the Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The Hobbit's success. Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the Rings. It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him as The Silmarillion.So delineation is required if you want to read this. Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings. Think of it like you would think of any other children's classics: children's classics. If you take it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not written to be like that. But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a failure in children's fiction. It is not children's fiction, it is epic fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction. That is EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit. They try to put it in the same type of genre or playing field as The L. R. They are both masterpieces, and I love them both dearly. But one is for children, the other with adults.Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem. How many books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel? Not very many. The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in the children's market. He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a sequel. So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put it. He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into it. So we have two works, spanning two different genres, and as far as surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel. Instead of looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece, an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece. The Hobbit is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time. The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market. Both are as important as the other, just in different fields.I haven't talked about The Silmarillion much. I have already reviewed it, so I won't go real in-depth here. But the same thing happened with it. People, expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the Biblical style of the published version. If Tolkien wrote that book out in narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer than Lord of the Rings. The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to many preconceptions that are incorrect.So, basically, in conclusion, think of it like this:1. The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece. He scores big with this one.2. The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy, not a trilogy. (Tolkien was always quick to point that out). The Crowning achievement of modern fantasy.3. The Silmarillion - the Bible of Middle-earth. Much more for students of his work than the causal reader.[From the Amazon.co.uk review: Enjoy Tolkien's Middle-earth!

Now I have started on my fifth reading. I was wrong. It is second only to The Lord of the Rings.Some say that fantasy is a lower form of the art of literature, because the highest art occurs when the artist puts himself and his real world into his work. But this is exactly what Tolkien did. As a scholar of ancient literature, he created a World like unto that which he studied, a World more wonderful than the creation of any other human.He created Hobbits who liked to draw maps and study ancient tongues and write about their adventures in their [his] World.His Hobbits faced the terror of giant spiders--as a child Mr. T. fell on a tarantula and was sick for days from the bite.His peace-loving Hobbits came to understand the horror of war, and found within themselves the courage to go forward, even in this understanding, to do what was needful. Lieutenant T. was leader of one of the few platoons which actually reached the enemy trenches at the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest battle in history, where the English advanced into a hail of machine-gun fire so fierce that the generals at headquarters could not believe the casualty reports.Mr. T. was raised and remained a devout Catholic. In the Lord of the Rings his Hobbits, along with good and valiant Men and Dwarves and Wizards, faced the evil Orcs of the Dark Lord of Mordor. It is not hard to notice that the Wizards are like Angels without wings, the Orcs like the imps of Hell, and the Dark Lord an enemy worthy of Satan himself.&quot;Here is beauty that cuts like a knife and burns like cold iron.&quot; -- C.S.Lewis, in the first review of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The biggest problem with this novel is perception.

TolkienThere and Back Again told by Bilbo Baggins&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is, simply put, the seminal novel in modern fantasy fiction. Although many may see &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as strictly being a children's book or at best one for the teenagers, there is much in this novel for fans of fantasy fiction of all ages. I believe the last time I read this wondrous and beautifully crafted story was when I was a teenager myself but having been inspired by Peter Jackson telling the tale of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the theaters I gladly purchased this novel to reread the epic and recapture the joy that it is to read one of Tolkien's classics.Although many an author in many different fantasy series have come close to creating worlds such as Middle-Earth in the fantasy genre, they have done just that, come close. Giving credit where credit is due though, a majority of these authors were inspired by Tolkien and their great works may never have been were it not for his in the beginning.If you're like me, making a revisit to the world of Tolkien's writings or coming to it for the first time, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is definitely the place to start. This review is for the Leatherette Collector's Edition, ISBN: 0-395-17711-1 which is a beautifully crafted novel and the illustrations by J.R.R. Tolkien himself all combine to make for a wonderful experience as Tolkien weaves the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his first big adventure through an extraordinary premise, exceptional plot setup and execution and perfect pacing.The premise:&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit that is visited by Gandalf the Wizard and the very next day twelve dwarves show up in his &quot;hole&quot; and enlist his aid as a &quot;burglar&quot; in their quest.Before poor Bilbo knows it, he's on a quest with the twelve dwarves and Gandalf to the far reaches of Middle-Earth to rob Smaug the dragon of that which belonged to dwarf King Thorin's father Thrain and is rightfully his, the treasure of Lonely Mountain.What follows from there is most certainly one of fantasy fiction's classic tales and an extremely enjoyable tale for all ages where Bilbo, Gandalf and the twelve dwarves go from one adventure to another on their way to the Lonely Mountain and an inevitable meeting with Smaug.I highly recommend this novel in this Leatherette Collector's Edition to those who've never read the story before and to those that have and wish to have the best possible version of it. It would be absolutely perfect if Peter Jackson would see fit to further immortalize this novel by bringing it to the silver screen after the overwhelming success of the &quot;The Lord of the Rings!&quot; {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit who lived a quiet life except for a single, life-altering year. He is recruited by a wizard named Gandalf to accompany a band of dwarves on their quest to reclaim the land and fortune that is rightfully theirs by slaying the dragon who took it from them. Bilbo is a reluctant hero, but nevertheless a memorable one. And his tale is an extraordinary flight of fancy that will stay in your heart forever. I am extremely picky about which books I like to reread, but after reading this for the first time I am sure that there will be a second, as well as a third and fourth. Tolkien is a masterful storyteller, and the world he creates is so vivid and well-conceived that it is easy to lose yourself in the forests of Mirkwood, the Misty Mountains or the desolate Lonely Mountain. Bilbo's adventure is captivating from one leg of the journey to the next. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; touches on issues of greed, courage and friendship without ever losing focus or seeming preachy. The only fault I can find is with me, for not reading it sooner."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My father introduced the late great Mr J.R.R. Tolkien to me when I was 8 years old, at a time when I had an insatiable appetite for literature of all kinds. From one night to the next I used to long to hear of events that - somehow - had been happening during my daily absence.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; only added to my impatience. The animated tones of my father's voice as he described Bilbo Baggins's journey into the middle earth, created images of green mist, rugged mountains and dark woods that only a childs mind can see so vividly. Yet I can remember the look on my father's face as he turned every page to rejoin the adventure. And I realised that this book - this fantasy land - had captured my fathers imagination as it had mine.For years after my father read me &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, I longed to recapture the feelings that I first encountered in Bilbo's adventure - to learn more about Gandalf, and conjure up further images of dark, mysterious scenery. But maybe that time was too special. Maybe I'm never mean't to find another book with such magical power ..... because maybe I was lucky to be introduced to one in the first place.There are a lot of maybe's in life - questions that go along unanswered - as there are in this book...... that's the magic.In my adult wisdom (!?) I now know that I'll never truly recapture the feelings that I had as a little girl. But - when the time arises - I will strive to provide the same atmosphere in which my children can realise the magic of reading. And &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the book that made me realise how important the magic is.So Mr Tolkien, wherever you are, I give you 5 stars.... for the thousands that you have already given me."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent fantasy adventure. It was easy to read and understand, and had lot's of humor in it. Though inferior to its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, the story of Bilbo Baggins quest provided the background that LOTR depended on. The Hobbit has a different feel from LOTR; it reads exactly like a fantasy, and that's what makes it a fun story. Wizards, dwarves, orcs, people, dragons, trolls, elves, and of course hobbits populate this book, so its in the right formula. Whenever I had to actually put the book down, I had thoughts of what would happen next to Bilbo and the dwarves. Despite the lighter tone in contrast with LOTR, there's nothing corny about The Hobbit. Upon finishing Tolkien's original classic, a person can't help being curious about Tolkien's masterpiece, LOTR. Besides, to feel the full grasp of LOTR, it is essential to read about Bilbo's quest first. Read and enjoy this classic, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I listen to a lot of audio books.Prior to The Hobbit, I heard Tim Curry read Dune: House Corrino (the last in the Dune Prequel Trilogy)...Edward Hardwicke read Sherlock Holmes...and Jim Dale read the Harry Potter books.All of the above voices are British, so I'm used to that. In fact, I prefer it. A Brit could read a telephone book and it would sound interesting to me.However, despite my penchant for the British dialect, it took a while for me to get used to narrator Rob Inglis' deep, mellifluous voice. I'm not sure why. Maybe because he seemed to read more slowly than the other narrators. Maybe it's because some of his vocalizations sounded similar. Or maybe it's because I've read the story before and I kept waiting for the next exciting thing to happen.Or maybe it was the songs J.R.R. Tolkien's characters burst into from time to time throughout the book. Inglis actually sings the songs! His singing voice is very good, but the songs seemed to last forever. (I fast forwarded through a few of them.)All of this is starting to sound as though I didn't like Inglis' reading of The Hobbit. Pish-posh. As it said, it took a while to get used to, but I quickly did so -- and hated to see the story end.A classically-trained Shakespearean actor, Inglis is a natural to read Tolkien. He has an incredibly expressive voice. Because of its baritone nature, his renderings of dwarves, dragons and goblins was dead-on.As I mentioned, I've read The Hobbit many times. I bought my first copy of it in the early '70s, in fact. But this is the first time I've ever heard it read to me.It was positively delightful! Perhaps Tolkien intended for his story to be read aloud. I don't know. But I loved listening to the adventures of Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin &amp; Company and all the creatures they encounter in their journey to Smaug's lair. Especially by a reader with such a marvelous voice.The quality of this 10-CD set is impeccable. The voice is clear and crisp. The sound level in all CDs is perfect. I have nothing but praise for this unabridged audio book.Which is why I bought Inglis' reading of Tolkien's other (perhaps more famous) works: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King.

The introduction by Christopher Tolkien is about twenty years old, having been written for the British 50th anniversary edition in 1987. I don't believe this introduction has been available in an American edition before, so its good that it finally made it into print here. The book is well-designed and made so that it will last through many rereadings, as a classic should, and it is much nicer to hold and read than previous American editions, which tend to feel cheap and clunky. The paintings and line drawings by JRR Tolkien are as fresh and beautiful as they must have been when they were new, and much to be preferred over the illustrations provided by other artists. I believe that this edition of The Hobbit is the closest American version of how Tolkien himself would have liked it to have been published."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Tolkien's Hobbit takes the imagination on a wonderful flight of fantasy. I read this book on a yearly basis and each year I am delighted and captivated by the world of Bilbo Baggins.Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, Smaug. They have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climactic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but also to a new adventure for his friends in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Tolkien is a master storyteller and the depth of his skill is best seen in this tale. In the following trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; the story is continued, but the sheer delight of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is never fully recaptured. This collector's edition is beautifully bound. Even more enjoyable are the illustrations and paintings by the author himself."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The ability to zoom in on the beautiful and detailed illustrations and the notes made this an easy purchase for me."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Just saying now, if you want to see the movie (An Unexpected Journey), only some part from the book are in the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"There is no other way to put it than what I wrote in the tittle of this review.

If you read it once, then 5-10 years later you want to read it again. I read my first (paperback) edition of The Hobbit when I was 12 years old. As I re-read it over the last four decades, I found that I could appreciate it for many different reasons. As a pre-teen, I liked the author's light and lively story-telling. It was easy to visualize the characters and enter into the story. As a young adult, I appreciated the way the author showed the characters could change/grow by being willing to enlarge their horizons. In mid-life, I appreciated the exploration of moral issues woven into the engaging tale: racial intolerance, obsession, selfishness. Later on, I began to see some of the political allegory: Hobbit culture echoed how the British saw themselves and Bilbo's encounters with Elves, Dwarves, Wizards, and Men represented the best and worst of how the relations of nations were in motion at the time of the book's first publishing. My point is no matter how many times one reads The Hobbit, it's many rich dimensions will bring us back to time and again to read and enjoy it anew. It's truly a book for all seasons."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I wouldn't consider myself a frequent reader but I purchased this book because of the Lord of the Rings movies that I love so much.

Along the way, the 15 of them had to climb goblin-filled mountains, venture through spider-infested forests, hide from demonic wolves, and escape from an elf castle. Bilbo gets lost in a cave and finds the creature Gollum, who Bilbo steals a magic ring from. Gandalf ends up leaving the other 14 to fight the dragon alone.This story is very well written.

There was so much detail that allowed me to visualize the entire settings perfectly. I was expecting somewhat of good detail because that's what I've heard about the book, but not this good. It was incredible. Prior to this book I have never read a Lord of the rings book, but now I plan to read the rest of the series. The book gives you the feeling like your actually there more than the movie does.The book lets you know how Bilbo Baggins is feeling, and that is a big asset to the novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading or who is looking for a book to read. It will be especially enjoyable for the people that like adventure books. The setting of this book is takes place in a forest, mountains, and other outdoor places. I can honestly say that this is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. I was actually looking forward to reading it day after day for homework. All the other books I've read did not have any appeal to me.This book has a great tone set by the author. The tone of this novel is very curious. By that I mean that is it constantly makes one wonder what's going to happen next in the story. The tone made me want to read more and more are the story went on. The book got exciting at the perfect times and it became subtle at the appropriate times as well.

JRR Tolkien created an entire world, several languages and most importantly a story that will stand the test of time. Especially with the Lord of the Rings triology that followed Tolkien made Fantasy books what they are: an anology of our own history, both good and bad. The marshalling of the good powers against Mordor was nothing but WWII written in a fantasy style; superbley done. Most fantasy novels today are old reruns of Tolkiens work; I read some and give the books away; I still have The Hobbit, The Triology and The Simmerelian. The only modern fantasy novels that can compare (though the author is dragging things on a bit) is Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.

So I picked it up and scribble 'In a hole there lived a Hobbit.' That is a quote of J.R.R. Tolkien. That is how he began into the adventure of this lovely book. How amazingly awesome this is written. Tolkien has a wonderful way of story telling and bringing adventures to life. (as he diminstrates with this book) Biblo Baggins will be remembered ages from now as the main character in the greatset prelude to the greatest trilogy.The story starts off with Bilbo living hapily in his hobbit hole not bothering anyone. When the wizard Gandalf. (which is my favorite character. If you read LOTRs you will find to love him even more) He tells Bilbo that he has been chosen to come with a band of dwarfes to help get their riches back. Bilbo is reluctant but goes anyways. I would love to write a long review telling all that happens, but that would give away this wonderful book. And the best part about it is the first time you read it, it's amazing. Just know that there is battles with orcs, other hobbits. Great meetings with elves. (Elrond) Battle scenes involving a great archerer. Please take my advice and read this book.

Please read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is mostly based on a fantasy world with fantasy people. For anyone that enjoys to reading those types of books I would recommend. I enjoyed the thirteen dwarves and how they identified their own personalities. My most favorite person would have to have been Gandalf,the wizard. He was the one who had been experienced on the journeys and felt settled when they were faced with another conflict or situation. And without him this journey would have never begun in the first place.

At first, I believed this book to be quite a silly story. However, after much reading I have come to see new aspects in the story. The way that the author describes the setting made mr feel as if I was marching through the woods on the adventure. During the dwarve's adventure, they come into contact with many obstacles including goblins on the search to capture them, eagles coming to their rescue, and huge spiders with venim dripping from their mouths. Every step, from the opening of the story onward, is a great adventure. Within the woods of the Misty Mountains one never knows what may be lurking around them. This book is truly a fantasy novel. With goblins, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and wizards, one can only imagine the fantasy it brings. Although as unrealistic the story may seem, I find myself hoping for Bilbo the hobbit to save the dwarves through each adventure. I recomend this book for suspense and mystery.

It is just one of those stories you can read over and over and still get completely engrossed in the adventure. The heart of this book lies in the timeless characters Tolkein creates. They are realistic in their humanity, but the fairy tale essence heightens their appeal. You just can't wait to see whom you are going to meet next.

I also talked about the joy of rediscovering beloved books through annotated editions, and &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; of J. R. R. Tolkien annotated by Douglas A. Anderson was my prime example. After all, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was about to hit theaters and even as I write this I have learned that yesterday would have been Tolkien's &quot;Eleventeenth&quot; birthday.An annotated version of book involves much more than simply rereading a book. If that was all I want to do I still have my illustrated edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will pictures from the Arthur Rankin, Jr./Jules Bass animated production of the story. The annotated edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; provides an explication of the sources, characters, places, and things that made Tolkien's novel a classic. The text is fully restored and corrected, for those who care about such things, with Anderson's notes placed alongside for easy reference. That along would justify adding this volume to your Tolkien library, but in addition there over 150 illustrations, including Tolkien's own original line drawings, maps, and color paintings. Those, of course, are treasures, but Anderson has also provided illustrations from around the world and the most fascinating part of this book for me was looking at how, for example, Bilbo and the Trolls were drawn for Portuguese, Slovakian, and Swedish edition of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; won the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inkling Studies, which sounds very impressive (and I even have some inkling at the what it means). This is one of those treasures where you would give five stars for the story, five stars for the annotations, and five stars for the illustrations. Granted, this is not the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; anyone should read.

Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth covering with a beautiful gold dragon in the lower right corner (non other than Smaug himself). The pages are crisp and bright white, not a hint of yellow. The illustrations, scattered generously throughout, are both in color and in black and white and intermingle beautifully with the story. Alan Lee has truely captured Tolkien's characters better than any of the other artists who have tried.

The characters have depth, and the perils - as fantastic as they are - have a vivid air of urgency. While the _Rings_ epic may be faulted by some for including too much &quot;superfluous&quot; expository information, the Hobbit sticks to the story at hand. It is a wonderful introduction to adult fantasy books for any child, and one that would work well read out loud.Young readers can easily identify with Bilbo, the diminutive protagonist. Small in stature and initially lacking in confidence, the others in the expedition doubt his worth. However, eventually he proves himself to be invaluable to the cause and the most rational of the party. Isn't this the dream of many children?

The first time around, I increased the font size, as it is rather small. The second time around, I did not, and I have been able to read without problems. The font size is still a little small for my tastes, and if increasing the font size causes interruption of the book material, that is an issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm still glad to at least know that this might be the problem if it happens again with other books - I suspect it will.The Hobbit is a fun and entertaining book, and you can get much better reviews of the content from other people.

It lacks the epic scale, being more of a children's bedtime story, and an incredible one at that. If you've read it after reading The Lord of the Rings, expecting something in the same vein, you're not going to find it. You'll get a rich tale with no peer in children's fiction, written for the sheer enjoyment. The complexities of Middle-Earth are absent, and the excitement of the quest is the focus.Growing up I had the good fortune of having The Hobbit read to me over and over.

I suppose this is the ideal way to experience The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"What a joy to read, again, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. It was read aloud to me in school when I was in Grade Five and it still has the same power to entrance now that I older. In fact, there is a new appreciation for this book as it takes me away from my stuffy adult self, much like Mr. Baggins at the beginning, content in my little hole with my daily routine. I completely forgot that dragons are real, dwarves are surly, goblins are not to be trusted, magic is common, and a ring can begin an adventure. This volume does not have the scope of the trilogy (except in the last chapters) and can fell ever so slightly twee at times but it has enough charm to take one to a magical place. And that, after all, is the joy of reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My friend had been bugging me to read this book and finally, I reluctantly did so.

I thought that many things that should have been described more were given inadequate descriptions, and things that were less crucial to the story were drawn out. One example of this is the fact that the walk through Mirkwood lasted longer than some books, and only parts of this were vital to the story.

I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

The writing style was excellent, and there was enough going for it to keep any reader interested. On a personal note, I found The Hobbit to be better than any of the Lord Of The Rings stories. My only complaint, however, pertains to the length of the book. A fair chunk of it related to pure description(ie: forests, dwarves, climate), and while it's necessary to get the feel for the setting, it just simply drags a little too long. Some trimming would have worked for the better! --&gt; 7/10"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit: or There and Back Again\\" was my introduction to the extraordinary world of J.R.R. Tolkien. I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" at least four times in the thirty-five years since I first discovered it, and have never ceased to be thrilled by Bilbo Baggins and his brave cohorts. Their quest to destroy the evil dragon Smaug, recover stolen gold, deliver the enslaved people of Lake Town, and the strong bond of friendship they forge along the way, has thrilled millions of readers. Although \\"The Hobbit\\" is a prequel, of sorts, to the \\"Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,\\" it stands on its own as a wonderful tale of magical fantasy, and as a story of personal courage and growth.\\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs.\\" Tolkein's description of the Hobbit's home is important to form an understanding of Bilbo Baggins' character. Mr Baggins is the particular Hobbit of note, for whom the book is titled. He likes nothing more than comfort, and dislikes nothing more than change. What is a hobbit, you ask? Hobbits are \\"a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink.\\" Unfortunately they no longer live on Earth.Bilbo, who leads a very comfortable life at his home, Bag End, near the bustling village of Hobbiton, is rudely interrupted one day by a wise old wizard, Gandolf the Gray. Gandolf, with a great deal of pressure, persuades Bilbo to set out with thirteen angry, and determined dwarves, to reclaim their stolen treasure from a terrible dragon. The Hobbit, who has never stolen anything in his life, nor would he think to do so, is proclaimed \\"The Burglar.\\" And the skeptical dwarves are reassured by Gandolf that \\"there is more to Bilbo than meets the eye.\\"The troop ventures off, through various mysterious, mystical lands that no longer exist on Earth - Rivendell, the elves stronghold, the Misty Mountains, Mirkwood Forest, Lake Town and the Lonely Mountains. They meet and befriend numerous memorable characters along the way, and encounter fiendish enemies also. It is on this journey that Bilbo finds the all powerful golden ring, that plays such an important role in Tolkein's masterful epic the \\"Lord Of The Ring Trilogy.\\"Before Bilbo can return to the comfort and security of Bag End, he will fight many battles, change lives, influence the future, and undergo changes himself. The drama, suspense and sheer beauty of Tolkien's tale will captivate you. It is truly an unforgettable story, written in a most unique literary style, by a man who has created and peopled an entire world, and given its inhabitants a new language.

Their destination is the Lonely Mountain, in which lies the dwarves stolen fortune, guarded by a horrible dragon named Smaug.How easy is was to lose yourself in this world for awhile. I kept thinking about it every time I put the book down. It also wonderfully sets up the Lord of the Rings trilogy that includes two of the characters from &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; If you've never read this book like I hadn't, and are a big fan of either Harry Potter or the Robert Jordan books, you owe it to yourself to read this. It's great!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Now that I have read The Hobbit I must conclude that the reason for its apparent fame and renown was its novelty when it was published. Perhaps this book was the first of the fantasy genre, pioneering paths that would inspire and guide other fantasy writers for decades to follow. However, on top of this I must say that I personally found the book dreadfully unexciting. I am sure that if you have ever played Dungeons and Dragons or any similar RPG game you would have invented a story with a far more suspenseful, coherent, and intriguing plot than this one. Of course, the character of Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) is cute and quaint to say the least, his character does not exceed the shallow heroes of most average science fiction/fantasy books (you know, that clueless maverick who despite his befuddlement always comes out on top)... Unfortunately, Bilbo's 13 companions are similarly left undeveloped in a story that could have brought out so much in them. I have heard that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is better, so I will read that next, but for now I have no further positive remarks about Mr. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I first found this book it excited me. After reading it, I must say that I now despise it. After only a few pages, I began to see darkness under its shallow mask. I can't believe people would buy a book of this caliber. It irritates me to no end. Let me begin my journey.It was a sunny Tuesday if I remember correctly. I was taking my unicycle home and noticed an eight year old kid waiting for the bus. I didn't want this kid to beat me up, so I had to look bigger than him, as I do with most mammals. I approached the kid with an awry grin on my face. The lonely rider stared up at me with terror. My plan was working. To be honest, I was terrified on the inside, but I had to show this animal who's boss. I hovered over him, completely shrouding him in my shadow. I won. The kid broke. He ran screaming. That sure taught him. I grabbed my spoils from his seat. His backpack contained few items. Some of the better ones included some stickers, a ham sandwich, and this book. I beat my chest in victory, then proceeded to skip home.I sat down in my porcelain throne at my house and skimmed through the book. Seemed at the time like just a children's fable. How wrong I was. I flipped back to the first page and began to read it for real. The first thing that struck me was the book trying to explain what a Hobbit was. I swore the book and ripped out this page. I did not dare read that in fear of a satanic summoning ritual. I proceeded with caution.The first chapter starts out fairly simple. An odd rabbit creature (presumably a hobbit, but I was not sure) was living in a hole like the scum he was. Pretty soon, he is visited by an older gentlemen named GrandGolf, or something of the sort. This character is my favorite at the moment. Grandgolf sees the rabbit creature and is immediately disgusted by it, insisting this creature leave his home, or be slain by him there. The rabbit is enlisted into the army and becomes the slave of Grandgolf. He now must travel with Grandgolf's company if he wishes to escape an eternal damnation.The book only goes down from here my friends. The author tries to envelop us in creatures that I think he made up himself. What am I? Eight? How am I to believe these lies without proof? I feel saddened about how lonely this author must have been in order to imagine such divine creatures. Without anything backing it up, none of this book is solid. How am I to believe that things such as trolls, dwarves, and wolves exist? I must confess that many of these ideas made me confused throughout the book. However, I press on hoping it will pick up, only to find myself losing more of my sanity.Sluggishly I continued the fantasy story of Tolkein. It made me queasy to start reading again, but I trudged on with a vengeance now. The rabbit continued reluctantly on his quest, hoping to ultimately escape the powers of Grandgolf the wizard. Until then, he lays awake at night, hoping for someone to save him. Eventually the party must cross a mountain. This is where the rabbit decides to make his grand escape. Without thinking, he kicks one of the dwarves in the crotch and jumps down with reckless abandon. He must have hit his head on a rock or something because he wakes up later.He opens his eyes to probably the most beautiful site in the book. A small creature called a Gollum rests on a rock in the middle of an underwater lake bantering to himself. This character has got to be the most believable in the book so far. Having been driven mad from the illusions that had been fabricated by the heinous author, he now sits quietly and often has discussions with himself. The rabbit, now crazy as well, sees this Gollum as salvation from the overbearing wizard-kind. He approaches it without hesitation and quickly falls in love.The rabbit grasps the hands of the Gollum, and after several sloppy make-out sessions they get married and the Gollum gives the rabbit a ring. With the loot in hand, the rabbit decides he has everything he needs and decides to divorce the Gollum. The Gollum does not like this one bit. It goes into a raging fit and chases after the rabbit with but a broken heart. With his quick thinking, the rabbit puts on the ring, which happens to give it super powers. The rabbit turns invisible, leaving the broken Gollum to wallow in pity and self loathing. The rabbit makes his way out of the mountain, only to fall back into the clutches of the warlord dwarves. Normally, the rabbit would curse himself for being so careless, but now he had the upper hand. With the wedding ring of super powers he can finally take his revenge on those who he had called master.The rest of the book is quite trivial as the rabbit finds ways to kill off his owners one by one, eventually teaming up with a dragon to conquer the world. I didn't feel like reading the rest of it in fear of spontaneous combustion, but I can tell it wasn't going anywhere.From what I have read of this book I can tell that an amateur wrote it. With it's false ideals and creatures there is no possible way that any book in this manner can be taken seriously. It has okay characters overall, and the sex scenes were alright as well. I just wish that the author had highlighted the theme of rebellion in a more positive manner instead of taking the route he did.I believe that this book receives more praise than it should be getting. I can hardly believe that this book was based off the movie. The differences are very uncanny and it's almost impossible to see this book and the movie under the same title as one in the same. Without the movie, I doubt anybody would have heard of this book, and I find it hard to call this a classic in anything but age."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I compare this story to those in the Harry Potter series, the Hobbit fails to impress.

Maybe Homer's epic poems started it, more likely it started long before him, a time so old that everything can be both true and not quite true, and men and Gods are interchangeable. This is one of those stories. A quiet Hobbit (Bilbo) lives comfortably (as Hobbits are prone to do), when a Wizard named Gandalf knocks on his door (as wizards frequently do in these kinds of stories). Much to his surprise, Bilbo is soon off on an adventure.Adventures, the things found out (and things found) do two things. They change the adventurer and they change the world around. This adventure does both. The quiet, shy, Bilbo becomes the leader of the adventure (much to his dismay), and as happens in good fantasy adventure stories, the changes have much more far reaching consequences than anyone (even Gandalf) could predict, and then there is the ring tha he finds accidentally while trying to escape from the trolls (but then that is the stuff of many later books).The people of Middle Earth, the trials and tribulations the world since the end of the 'good old days', the trials of the adventurer, and hints of the impact on the rest of the world are wonderfully described in a style that appeals to young and old alike. This is a story in the best story telling tradition. It's fun, it's easy to read, and it's a classic tale of adventure and growth. I'm only sorry I waited so long to read it!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This novel that the immortal Mr. Tolkien penned will abide in my heart forever.

Tolkien's great work, The Hobbit, has been overshadowed by his still greater work The Lord of the Rings. Nowadays, most people regard The Hobbit simply as the prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit, however, is a great story even standing on its own.The Hobbit is the story of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a staid, unadventurous member of a staid, unadventurous race. One day, Bilbo is visited by the wizard Gandalf and thirteen homeless Dwarves and somehow becomes their burglar with the job of helping the Dwarves recover their lost gold and home, stolen by the dragon Smaug.When they first set off on their adventure, Bilbo is not much use to the Dwarves and seems more a burden than a burglar. He can't seem to do anything right. Over time, however he becomes more confident and takes more of a lead. By the end of the story, he has helped defeat the dragon and has saved the Dwarves lives more than once.Tolkien shows great skill with the plot of the Hobbit, never allowing the pace to slacken but keeping the reader excited with Bilbo's adventures. Throughout the book, he shows the same keen ability to depict the natural world as he does in the Lord of the Rings, and so makes Middle Earth come to life in a way few authors of fantasy can. Bilbo's growth as a leader and a person are convincingly shown and Tolkien, at times displays a wry wit, especially with the politics of Laketown and Bilbo's conversations with the Dragon.If there is one fault with the Hobbit, it is that at times Tolkien was too aware that he was writing a children's book, and at times, his writing takes on a slightly condescending tone, the sort of tone that adults often use when talking to small children and which the children really don't like much.

Although it was written in a more lighthearted manner than the Lord of the Ring Series, also by Tolkien, it does not lessen at all the fantastic storytelling of the book.In short, a hobbit (an imaginary creature that resembles people, just half their size), named Bilbo Baggins, is whisked away on an adventure, along with a band of courageous dwarves, and a wizard, in order to reclaim the dwarves lost treasure that was stolen by a dragon named Smaug. It sounds like a story to start your typical Dungeons and Dragons encounter, but trust me that it will be much more than that. I couldn't put the book down after I picked it up, I think that I had finished it in about two days. If you've already seen the movie, don't worry, there is much storyline that the movie didn't recount. Besides, you can boast to your friends after reading this that you know how the Hobbit movies will end."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A great book.

Going back and re-reading the Hobbit as a part of working my way through NPR's list of the Top 100 SciFi books of all times was a little disappointing. By comparison to the subsequent LOTR series, The Hobbit seemed to lack a cohesives story and had a less than complete ending. It falls short in comparison to LOTR in scope, somewhat in detail and in a unifying theme other than being a unique tale set in an imaginary world populated by strange beings.All that said, I would recommend that you certainly start with this book before reading the LOTR series as I think if you read The Hobbit after LOTR you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've lost count of the number of times I've read The Hobbit over the years, it was the book that started my love of all things fantasy and it was always a go to book that I could read again and again as I was growing up. It must have been at least 5 years since I last read it though so I wanted to pick it up again before going to see the movie. It doesn't matter how many times I pick it up I still love it as much as the first and it always surprises me how many little details I forget between readings.I know that most people have already read the story but if you're one of the few who haven't then I'd highly recommend it. It's a great story for adults but I also think it makes fantastic bed time reading with children because it's such a fun adventure story. There is a reason it's considered a classic! The last thing Bilbo Baggins is looking for is an adventure, he is quite happy living in his hobbit hole enjoying plenty of food and good company when he wants it (which is not too often thank you very much). When Gandalf arrives with a party of thirteen dwarves Bilbo is convinced they have come to the wrong person for help but the more he learns about their quest to re-claim their lands from the dragon who stole them the more curious he becomes and in the end he can't resist joining them.Bilbo is the least likely of heroes, he doesn't consider himself particularly brave or smart and he has practically no experience of travelling or fighting, but when it comes down to it the dwarves wouldn't have got very far without him. I always enjoy seeing Bilbo reach is full potential, he goes on a journey of personal discovery and proves to everyone just what a strong character he is. The story isn't as dark or scary as the Lord of the Rings books are and is suitable for a younger audience but it is still quite scary in places and the scenes with Gollum are particularly creepy. I love the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum but have to admit that I'd be hopeless at figuring out the answers myself if I was in Bilbo's place! The Hobbit is such an enjoyable story and a great introduction to the Lord of the Rings books, I really think I'm going to have to re-read those this year too!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"As everyone knows, this is an absolute classic and a good place to start for beginners and veteran readers alike.

It is a classic tale of a fish out of water exploring the greater fantasy world he lives in, much like Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. Bilbo Baggins is the fish, though he is much more unwilling than Luke or Harry to explore the fantastical world in which he lives. As a Hobbit, he lives in a comfortable hole in the ground where life goes on at a leisurely pace. There's plenty of time for meals, smoking, meals, drinking, and more meals. Then he's visited by the wizard Gandalf, who is helping some dwarfs organize an expedition. Gandalf wants Bilbo to go along, partly to break the unlucky number of dwarfs (thirteen), partly because he thinks Bilbo will be useful. They head off across Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain, where the dwarfs once ruled. The dragon Smaug turned out the dwarfs and turned their underground kingdom into his lair. The head of the dwarfs, Thorin Oakenshield, is a descendant of the rightful king and is going to take their kingdom back.Like most of these stories, at first Bilbo is out of his depth. But he quickly becomes more resourceful, using his wits and his growing bravery to get out of the various tricky situations he and his companions wind up in. At one point he is separated from the group in the caverns of the Misty Mountains and has a delightful battle of wits with Gollum, a wretched creature who loses his preciousss ring to Bilbo. The ring becomes quite pivotal in The Lord of the Rings. But that is another adventure.This story is very well written. The descriptions are vivid and the world is well-crafted. The characters are interesting and the situations have plenty of humor and drama. The style of writing is a little old-fashioned, as if it were an epic, though some places the author addresses the reader (like, \\"for you it would be very strange if...\\") almost like he is a storyteller with an audience listening to him speak. I'm sure it will be wonderful to read this to my children in the coming years."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is one of my favorite books by my favorite author.

Took about a week to read and i am now reading the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit- By J.R.R. TolkienThe Hobbit is a very good and quite easy read. It is not very difficult to read because of the vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. Although in some areas it is a little difficult because the names of the dwarfs get confusing. The characters are explained very well and by the end of the book it really seems like you have met the characters. All except for Gandalf. Gandalf is a little less explained than the other characters, all of the other characters have a little backstory on how they came to be in the story. Although the author gives a brief physical description of Gandalf, Gandalf's personality or non-physical characteristics are unknown. I really like J.R.R. Tolkien's writing style because in one paragraph he is telling the story of what is happening and the next paragraph he may be talking directly to the reader which I thought was very interesting. My favorite character has to be Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is my favorite character because he is the character that the reader gets to know the most. Another reason why Bilbo is my favorite character is because he is an unsuspecting, \\"normal\\" hobbit when Gandalf came along and changed his life. I think what the author was trying to say through this book, was that life can change very quickly so enjoy what you have. You never know when the next wizard will come along and tell you that you that you are going on a quest. One of my favorite moments of the book was the Golem chapter, or chapter five. This is one of my favorite moments in the book because it really sets the entire story up and for the Lord of the Rings books. This is the scene when Bilbo picks up the ring that can make him invisible. I also really like the author's word choice and how he forms sentences that flow and transition into one another. I also think that the names of the places and people are very interesting. I thought that it was very inspiring that he made up his own language for the ruins. One thing that I didn't like about this book was that the names got very confusing and I kept having to flip back to figure out who was talking, what race the thing that was talking was, and what the relationship between the speaker and Bilbo. Another thing I didn't like about this book was how some of the characters were not explained as thoroughly as the others. \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\\" This quote sticks out in my mind because it is a key describer, hook, and introducing sentence to the entire story.

Tolkien first introduces the reader to the race of hobbits, which are little people who live to eat, in the form of Bilbo Baggins. A wizard named Gandalf approaches Bilbo with an adventure and out of courtesy Bilbo invites him to tea. Bilbo receives a surprise when a group of thirteen dwarves arrives with Gandalf. Gandalf has already volunteered Bilbo to be a burglar for the dwarves in their attempt to reclaim gold that is rightfully theirs from the vicious dragon, Smaug. Bilbo finally agrees to this plan and they set off the very next day for Lonely Mountain, the place where Smaug currently inhabits. Bilbo then experiences an epic journey where he is transformed from a regular hobbit that is incapable of leading to a leader who is courageous in the face of adversity and even becomes a hero before the journey is over. As the story develops the road for Bilbo and the dwarves becomes increasingly ominous and the road ahead seems to present more dangers than the road behind. Each of Tolkien's chapters symbolizes a new obstacle to overcome, which actually has little to do with the ultimate goal of Bilbo and the dwarves of reclaiming the gold from Smaug. However, all these chapters culminate in an ultimate battle between good and evil which pits the \\"Good People,\\" the humans, elves, and dwarves in a battle for supremacy over the brutal Whargs and goblins. Even though initially written as a child's story people of all ages can enjoy The Hobbit, which is the prequel to and establishes many of the ideas prominent in Tolkien's most famous work The Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"What is there to say?

It's a must for all fantasy libraries and collectors."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"As the prelude to the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit or There and Back Again, is a magnificent tale of magic, fantasy, and adventure. I found that I could not set this book down. With each page, I was that much more drawn into the realm of Middle Earth, and I made myself put the book down for a little bit in order to enjoy it.The characterization in this book is phenomenal. Both the protagonists and antagonists throughout the novel help creat the landscape of the book, as well as set the foundation for Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, displays the ideal character in that he is forced into a world of adventure of magic. As an innocent creature unaware of the outside world, Bilbo matures throughout the book, and is a classic example of a character who, by the end of the book, has developed into a great intellectual character. Bilbo continues to display this intellect throughout the Lord of the Rings.I have experienced many a conflict with other readers who did not enjoy the Hobbit, and I'm not saying that this book is in everyone's favor, but any reader of fantasy, magic, and adventure will love this book. I recommend the Hobbit to every person no matter what age. As a timeless tale of Tolkien, I give this book five stars (although, it probably deserves more)."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book was boasting with the great imagination of J.R.R Tolkein.

Or maybe they just sounded like it. I know everyone is intitled to an opinion, but I just can't help feeling overwhelming dislike for these such people.

Tolkien. This book was written all the way back in 1937 but still wows readers today. It is the prelude to the World famous Lord of the Rings series and contains many similarities and some characters.The book takes place in the magical land of middle earth where magical beings and strange animals run wild. As you read through the book you meet everything from evil lairs to villages and even vast forests. They help set the mood and are described in a very creative way that truly keeps your interest by leaving no detail untouched. This makes the book much more fun to read and keeps you entranced.The characters are also a crucial part of this book that makes it as great as it is.In the beginning there is just one main character but not soon after u are introduced to a wide array of main characters. As the group travels the encounter many tasks and adventures that set the pace for the book. But at one point in the book they split up and it is back to the single main character.Throughout the book the characters are trying to find secret treasure and travel the land. They meet new friends along the way and also have to fight off orcs and other dangerous foes. Then they arrive at the task of finding the treasure and they realize it's guarded by the giant dragon. Taking control of the treasure then becomes the main goal of the group.This book is a truly interesting one that will entertain people of all ages. The great plot, characters and setting will draw you in and ensure your interest.

The dwarves are going on a journey back to their home in the Misty Mountains that has been taken over by a dragon named Smaug.

While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a great book, I very much liked the different style from the Lord of the Rings, and think that Tolkien did a great job of introducing the finding of the ring, and middle earth.The kindle version of this book is well done including the occasional images, and flow."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Excellent children's story, probably one of the finest ever written, and never condescending to the reader. Now, if this were intended as a story for adults, I'd probably give it 4 stars, but being that it was written as a children's book it warrants a 5 (and then some). If I had read this at a younger age I probably would have been moved to tears; as things go I first read it at 21 and still greatly enjoyed it, which should speak volumes as to its quality. There's much adventure, peril, and perseverance through camaraderie, and it's a treat to witness to Bilbo's slow transformation from timid homebody to valiant hero.Highly recommended. If you enjoy fantasy at all then this is a must-read. Of course, it's also a prequel of sorts to the darker, longer, and more mature \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but even judged on its own merits is still classic fantasy and deserving of a spot in every personal library."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is awesome.

I just could not get through it. A year later, something happened when I picked up the book again. It was magic. Either a certain maturity level or a certain sophistication is necessary to appreciate J.R. Tolkein's writing. When I was ready, the book was wonderful. I don't hesitate to recommend this book to teens, but I might caution them that even though it might not be for them a this moment, they should keep it in mind for a second try as they get older. That alone can pique their interest.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I LOVE The Hobbit. I can't emphasize that enough. Love love love it! Now that I have my over-exuberance out of the way, I'll get down to it. This is a great book for all ages, though most of the younger children might have difficulty understanding it. I read it by myself and thoroughly enjoyed it, and I later read it to my 10, 8, and 6 year old nieces and nephew. They all enjoyed it immensely, and my oldest niece and nephew read it on their own as well. This is the edition I bought for myself and the edition I bought for them as well, and I didn't see any problems with it. However, like I recommended on the Lord of the Rings trilogy I wrote a review on, if different editions are of concern to you, since there are so many editions, I recommend looking at it in a bookstore where you can feel it and look at it and see which edition you prefer, then buy it on Amazon as you are likely to get a better deal on here. And of course on the off chance it's a better deal in the bookstore, you're right there with it. But chances are you'll get it cheaper here. Still, if you're picky about binding, typeface, maps, glossaries, and yada yada, you should physically look at it first. If not, buy this one. I like the feel of the pages. They aren't all slick and smooth where you can't separate the pages well. They have a warm feel to them, which I love! And the pages are easy to turn."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"As opposed to go on about different versions of The Hobbit publication, like some reviews obviously do, I am actually going to review The Hobbit book that includes illustrations from the 1977 animated movie, The Hobbit, by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass.Make note: this includes all the original text from Tolkien's wonderful book. It is not a publication of the Rankin-Bass film with its script and meager screen caps. And while this edition of The Hobbit does include some shots from the Rankin-Bass film, it is so much richer. This book includes concept art, art from the story boards and story treatments, character treatments. It even includes illustrations from the chapter \\"Queer Lodgings\\" and Bilbo's surrender of the Arkenstone, scenes which did not make it into the final cut of the Rankin-Bass film.Even if die-hard Tolkien fans had a grudge against the Rankin-Bass adaptation - and heaven knows, they and Tolkien himself have always been squeamish about talk of adaptations - I still highly recommend this edition as a must for any library and especially for aspiring illustrators and animators. Rankin-Bass Productions, Inc. were behind The Thundercats and the adaptations of The Last Unicorn and The Flight of Dragons. Their style is unique in an industry where nearly everyone, from DreamWorks to Warner Brothers, just can't shake that Disney style, even though Rankin-Bass did work under Disney's subsidiaries.In summation, Tolkien's text is happily preserved, and fans will get a behind-the-scenes view into the animated version of The Hobbit. This book is worth its weight in hoarded Dwarf gold."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have a few students who need this to help them read the novel.

I could not put this book down. I read it in just a few days and loved every minute of it. I read the reviews from some of the diehards with their criticisms but felt this book was the right one for me and I am happy I did. I especially loved the drawings in the book which I am under the impression Tolkien did himself.Now I am reading The Lord of the Rings and I'll read the Silmarillian next.I am also going to look for other versions of The Hobbit that give more detailed explanations of the book's content and further insight into the story. I believe there are some out there, at least from what I can vaguely remember seeing in my initial research to decide which version of The Hobbit to buy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Myth throughout the ages has been a powerful tool for mankind, providing wonderful stories, presenting beautiful archetypes, and teaching lessons. Tolkien was a lover of the Norse myths, the Germanic, and his work shows it. The man, far from being just a professor, was a genius, creating his own mythology from myths that already came before hand. The Hobbit is a wonderful way to get started on his work. The Hobbit is very much a myth for our time, with the wise old counselor who helps the reluctant hero to realize his full potential.The story starts out with Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, living a quiet life, only to have his life interrupted by a the wizard Gandalf and a group of dwarves. It appears a rather nasty dragon has stolen the dwarves' treasures and is now making his home in their lair. It's up to poor, little Bilbo to muster the strength that he never knew he had, so that he can help reclaim what is rightfully the dwarves, all the while dealing with goblins, trolls, and other uncomfortable situations.This is the perfect book for those new to Tolkien to start with. It's not as dark, dreary, and violent as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series or \\"The Children of Hurin,\\" (all of which are wonderful must read books: \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" being my favorite) or as complex as \\"The Similarion\\" (also a must read), but an excellent starting place for most ages. This is one of the most incredible books ever written, one of the most amazing stories ever told, and I've read it numerous times. This version, with illustrations by Alan Lee, helps accentuate the mythical world Tolkien created even more, breathing life and magic into the story. \\"The Hobbit,\\" is a book I look forward to having the joy of reading to my future children, sparking their imagination, awaking the magic within them, in the process. To those that like Norse/Germanic myths, there are plenty of things you'll recognize in names and tales. In fact, there is a little nod to \\"Beowulf,\\" in it. To those that just want their imaginations to soar, to be taken to another world, then this is the right book, as it has helped inspire today's fantasy books and video games. Read this treasure and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I find it interesting to note the similarities between the reviews of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; by Orson Card, and Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbitt.&quot; For both books, the vast majority of reviewers gave them a ten, with a small (but vocal!) majority with... differing opinions. For those who read &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; in their English classes and were bored, I feel pity. It is obvious that these young readers did not understand a word that Tolkien wrote. &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; was the vehicle that launched the entire genre of fantasy, and when viewed with that in mind, it becomes evident as to why &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; has a great deal in common with many other works of fantasy. To put it plainly, other writers have taken Tolkien's ideas, and put them to their own use. For those who had difficulty with the place names, just remember that Tolkien was a master of the English language -- don't expect yourself to understand everything he wrote, especially if you're still learning about the language. If you are one of those who thought Tolkien's grammar poor, then... well, you're just wrong. You have to know the rules in order to break them well, and Tolkien most certainly knew the rules. Finally, for those who simply found &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; boring, I would suggest that you read it when you are older; perhaps then you will begin to fathom the depth and richness of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I could not believe the content.

Like all great art, I see and understand more with each successive foray into Middle Earth. Tolkien's talent is indeed rare, for he possesses that much-sought-after skill of transporting his audience into a world that seems to be quite independent of author and reader alike. Indeed, one's impression is that this world has been and will continue to be whether or not he continues to read, and his position is that of the privileged observer. It is in every regard the most enjoyable type of story.

Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he likely had no idea that it would become the first book in a lengthy series which today serves as the archetypal example of high fantasy. Still further from his mind would have been the idea that his story could find its way into the theaters of the the next century as a blockbuster production.Taken solely on its own merits, however, The Hobbit is still an exceptional book. Tolkien weaves together bits of European mythology, stringing it into a tapestry with threads of his own prodigious creativity, to write a book with appeal to all ages. The poetry can be a bit corny by modern standards, but the overall style of writing and the narrator's tone make the story come alive for the reader.The Kindle edition of The Hobbit has an issue with images in text, causing many of them to appear \\"sideways\\" regardless of the angle of the Kindle. While this won't be an issue for the majority of readers, for some (particularly younger children), it could be frustrating.

I especially love the language Tolkien used and how \\"friendly\\" it sounds, and as I understand the history, it was originally written simply as a story for his own children - not even meant for publication! But we're all much luckier that it did get published. So, since my family has started listening to books while on driving vacations, I wanted to share this much-beloved story with my own children (and my review is of the *audiobook* rather than the actual book).The reader, Rob Inglis, has a wonderful English accent that highlights how \\"English\\" the story really is, and he gets very theatrical in the many different voices he uses for the many different characters. But that's where the problems began. Most of the voices he used for the dwarves (13 different voices!) we found difficult to understand and not especially pleasant to listen to. His voice for Gollum was worst of all (very screechy - which is entirely appropriate to Gollum - but not at all nice to hear on a long drive in the car). Plus he reads it very slowly, which didn't engage the kids and made it very hard for them to tolerate. Unfortunately, and no matter how many times I tried, we only made it about halfway before my wife insisted I turn it off and not start it again (and none of the kids protested in the least). Sadly it made a very long drive \\"there and back again\\" even longer and I wish I'd have had a backup book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit Ballantine Books, 1966, 307 pp., $7.99J.R.R Tolkien ISBN 0-345-33968-1What would you do if you were taken by a band of dwarves?

He is the father of an entire genre, a genre that has been able to carry many of us through our darkest hours. Although The Hobbit came out over 70 years ago, it is yet fresh and vibrant. Dear Bilbo is still an enchanting hero and still unique--so many main characters are thinly veiled reflections of ideal selves, whereas Bilbo makes us instead rather want to become Hobbits.The Hobbit is less world-weary than the Lord of the Rings. It is also a more tightly knit story. For these two reasons, I prefer The Hobbit to the later saga, but I am still grateful that I am a better person for having experienced both The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.In The Hobbit, we experience a series of adventures that are precipitated by an odd invitation from Gandalf, and through these adventures we see Bilbo pass from mere observer to central character. Tolkien was a master at many things: character, mythology, story; however, his observations of the essential qualities of human nature make his writings timeless and transcendent of societal changes.It was a joy to experience The Hobbit.

And beneath the thunder another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings\\" (pg 302).And the journey just gets better withThe Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, also best appreciated whist read aloud to fully savor Tolkien's poetic use of language.

But then he wrote further, resulting into one of the great epic of the world, The Lord of the Rings.The story tells us about the very first adventure of Bilbo Baggins out of shire and he got the Ring. After reading LoTR, I thought this story wont impress me much, but I was wrong. I was totally lost in this story as I was in LoTR's. It is a part of LoTR and a standalone story both. I loved Bilbo as much as I loved Frodo, infact, more than Frodo.The difference between other authors and Tolkein is that Tolkein wrote like he was actually telling the story himself and didnt write it just as a book or novel. You're sure to get lost in his world and feel yourself with the characters.Making a journey to Middle-Earth is one of the few good things you'll do in your life."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Have you seen the movies called The Lord Of The Rings Parts 1-3? Well, then you would like The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit is where The Lord Of The Rings all began. In the fantasy world of The Hobbit the reader gets attached to the crazy characters through the eye of the narrator.The Hobbit's time period is the ancient time between the age of the faerie and the time of men. The Hobbits are little people with brown curly hair who wear bright colors. They live in hills and green lands and live near water. Bilbo Baggins was a respected member of the Hobbits.The story began when Bilbo is craving for adventure. Bilbo gets along with people and he has a funny side to him. Bilbo is a good character who is very nice to the people around him.Here are some reasons why you would enjoy The Hobbit. The book's characters are lively and funny. There are goblins who are not smart. There is adventure and mystery in the book. There are dark caves and different types of people like elves, Hobbits, and goblins. This book is a fantasy book that is a good fantasy book.J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the best twentieth century authors. Tolkien's writing is funny and his charters seem to have a real life. Some of his quotes are funny like\\"Don't be a fool Mr.Baggins if you can help it.\\" I thought that the book was enjoyable and funny. I would recommend this book to fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"for me, this is a very enjoyable dramatization indeed. True, elderly, humorless, die hard Tolkein fans will probably find it corny - it was, a bit. Sometimes the sound effects are strange and laughable, but what's wrong with laughing? Given that it was recorded nearly 20 years ago you have to give it some leeway for less than perfect sound affects. For the most part I thought the acting was brilliant (save Gandalf, perhaps, whose voice might have better belonged to a man hawking fake Rolexes in central park), especially Bilbo. So, take my advice and give this recording a chance. My guess is you'll have more fun listening to this than listening to a bland but accurate unabridged reading of The Hobbit. Btw, if you have children and want to introduce them to Tolkein, but are reluctant to lay the whole epic at their feet quite yet, this would ideal for them."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It's hard to say why I never read the Hobbit before the age of 36. I was a sci-fi fan that dabbled in fantasy. I even played Dungeons and Dragons, but did so with an ignorance of its Tolkien roots. And no surprise, I had friends that were heavily into Tolkien as well.And then I saw Lord of the Rings...The Hobbit is an amazing read, telling the tale of a Mr. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire who cares little for adventures until Gandalf...Gandalf! ...arrives at his door. Soon Bilbo is swarmed by dwarves, and battles the uncertainty about his thieving skills by committing to join them and steal the treasure of the deadly Dragon Smaug.From this point we are launched into a fascinating tale filled with wondrous creatures and places, including the finding of the Ring, and end up with a multi-race epic battle.The Hobbit is a classic...there is no doubt, but what kept me from reading it all these years? I think the fact that many from my generation equated the Hobbit with the (often) geeky Dungeons and Dragons crowd.Whatever your reason for not reading the Hobbit, I ask you to reconsider. No avid reader, no matter what genre they favor, should have a book collection devoid of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The clarity of this audio version was absolutely wonderful.

Five outta five! :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you are looking for a good Fantasy story for the kids this Christmas, you would do very well in choosing The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. Mostly, this is because of the way in which details are presented and built into the proceedings in a clever yet uncomplicated fashion, which adds a lot of variety to the reading experience.The start of the book is somewhat simplistic because of the writing style, but this passes after the first couple of chapters, and develops into writing as sophisticated as the best of those writing Fantasy today. And it is surprising how much of the book is used by others for their own creations.The Hobbit is also a good choice for those intending to read the Lord of the Rings, since Ganadalf and Bilbo feature extensively in both books."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was one of the most fun books I have ever read.

Somewhere, in Tolkien's heaven, his heart has rest, for all of this joy given cannot go unrewarded.I feel that Tolkien showed us, through various races which peopled his Middle Earth, the various phases of human development. The races are earthy, airy, watery, and finally, fiery. The amazing Hobbits seemed to hold the balance necessary. They valued gold without greed, friends without demanding power over others, and family lineage, wherein even those of a \\"Tookish\\" nature could find acceptance in a neighborhood. Fundamentally, they were farm folk and tradesmen. One cannot help but observe there was a minimum of financiers in the Shire. Everybody works in the Shire, and elsewhere in Middle-Earth, soldiering is seen.Only a children's story? A book for children of all ages is more the case. Though the story originated in the childhood imagination of Tolkien on the foggy downs of England, it shows us a very subtle construction, a woven fabric of esotericism. At the pinnacle of the weave is the great advancement of the Wizards. Wizards have every opportunity to develop as Gandalf, full of fiery power, yet ever-vigilant and self-sacrificing; yet, as we are later to learn, sometimes they become susceptible to selfishness, self-centeredness, and a megalomanical preoccupatin with EGO and power. Wizards can fall from the grace which elevated them.Essential to all understanding of the adventures of the Hobbit is the fact that Bilbo Baggins does not like adventures at all. When Gandalf chooses Bilbo to host Thorin Oakenshield's party of Dwarves, Bilbo gives his opinion of Adventures thusly:\\"Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\\"The excitement is infectious as the troop encounters many dangers, for not all problems can be solved by the powerful axes of the dwarves. Sometimes, only the peculiar stubborn courage of the little Hobbit can get the troop out of harm's way. All along the journey, wondrous creatures are met; Elves, Men, and dangerous things of darkness and shadow, ending with an encounter with a dragon.****So How Does Tolkien Write So Magically?****Tolkien compresses TIME. Alternatively, he decompresses TIME. He does this by presenting history, events, and other characters through a very childlike perception of time. Sometimes vast epochs are explained in a single paragraph, or several generations of Hobbit, Dwarf, Elven or Human history are presented in a blur. Chronological events and occurrances are alternatively slowed or speeded up in the telling. TIME is magical for Tolkien. The reader is captured and fascinated, led along a narrative path like a child, sometimes fully awake, observing a blur of rapid action. Other times, it is though the reader is in a half-sleep, a \\"dreamtime\\" and unsure of the measurements of minutes, hours, days, years and epochs of time.This \\"child-time\\" is the distinct voice Tolkien achieves, causing many readers to view the Hobbit as a children's story, distinct from Lord of the Rings. It is not a different story. It is that the Hobbit represents the psyche before it awakens. It's primary concerns are creature comforts, rather than adventures.In the Hobbit adventure, it is far too early to present the power of Tolkien's purpose in its full revelation. Tolkien must allow us to wake up gradually. That is the adventure he invites us to take. The fullness of the truth is not yet shown. Tolken needs for the reader to develop an adventurous spirit.This shows itself by comparing the Hobbits. First is Bilbo Baggins, who grows by every adventure; but for Bilbo, the Shire can still be a home, at least, for many more years. Second, Frodo never expects to return to the Shire. Frodo lives, believing that only death awaits him, but his childlike psyche is now transformed into that of a fully-developed spiritual identity. Now he knows. The childlike dreamworld is gone. If Frodo fails, he knows Middle Earth will fall into despair. Frodo knows, what Gandalf and Aragorn knows. Bilbo had the assurance that the Shire would always be there. Frodo sees that if he fails his quest, all of Middle Earth will literally fall under the Shadow. Frodo's is not the psyche of the child-like Hobbit.Tolkien's masterpiece has much in common with C. S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". In both, martyrdom of self is very real. In LOTR, Frodo willingly marches to his own death, obeying the call to duty which bound the Fellowship. This compels him to an ultimate act of self-sacrifice, just as Aslan in the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" orchestrates his own martyrdom, to save a Son of Adam.The same device may be found in the tale of \\"Peter Pan\\" who claimed that he never wanted to grow up, and yet he fought a very real evil in Captain Hook.Tolkien & Lewis seem to have offered a clarion call to man, inviting us to transcend the mere pursuit of comfort, and to enter into the conflict between Good and Evil. It is nearly impossible to claim either author as superior. They are both exceedingly good.With childlike wonder we learn in this dear tale a simple truth that we find in other literature; the simple fact that conflict is seldom far, and Evil is always to be countered with courage. The reader may not remember the name of he who slays the dragon Smaug, but does it matter? A little reflection upon the character GANDALF will reveal much. --Bruce Bain"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This fantasy tale is actually a prequel or predecessor to Tolkein's famous epic, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is required reading for any serious student of fantasy or speculative fiction and I recommend it enthusiastically. J. R. R. Tolkein (1892-1973) was a noted philologist who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford University as well as a close friend of C. S. Lewis. &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; originally a story written for children, is a tale of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and how he helps a wizard named Gandalf and a group of dwarves in their quest when traveling through a land known as Middle-Earth. Hobbits are little people who are smaller than dwarves, don't have beards, live in holes in the ground, and don't wear shoes. They have hairy feet which have leathery soles. One day, Bilbo is visited by Gandalf and his adventures began. The following day a group of thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, visited Bilbo with Gandalf. They planned to travel to the Lonely Mountain to recover a treasure that had been stolen by the dragon Smaug many years earlier and they have decided to enlist the aid of Bilbo. In the travels of this troup, they overcome some trolls, find two ancient swords, meet friendly elves, and discover a secret message on their treasure map. They are captured by goblins and rescued by Gandalf. However, Bilbo is separated from the rest and finds himself alone in a dark cave where he meets the creature Gollum. After a contest of riddles, Bilbo escapes Gollum with the aid of a magical ring that he had found in the cave. Upon rejoining Gandalf and the dwarves, the travelers continue their trek but are soon attacked by Wargs (evil wolves). They are rescued once again, this time by giant eagles who fly them to safety.

Then the next day twelve dwarves show up at Bilbo's hobbit home. the dwarves want him to be their \\"Burglar\\".They go on a lot of adventures including going to rob Smaug the dragon of his treasures.

The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have \\"a really hard time proving themselves\\".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character.

Tolkien was the fist book that I read on my own as a child and it therefore holds a very special place in my heart. The story is not just an adventure story filled with magic and strange and wonderous creatures. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the gang of dwarves (Thorin Oakenshield, Kili, and Fili to mention a few) and their amazing journey to find the treasure guarded by the evil and selfish dragon Smaug. The story is a tale of self discovery, maturity and shows how much Bilbo Baggins changes as a man from the start till the finish. The descriptions used in the book are splendid and the small songs included add allot to the story (something I did not appreciate or understand as a child). I love the narration and I would recommend this splendid tale to not just fantasy fans but to anyone that fancies a good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My son really enjoyed listening to this book on cd.

The story follows one Bilbo Baggins in his wonderfull adventure. He is enterrupted from his normal life by some Dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf who want him to go with them to battle a dragon named Smaug. He eventually agrees and follows them on thier journey to the Dwarves to the moutain they once called home before the dragon lived there. On the way Bilbo encounters goblins, spiders, orcs, wolves, and even a former hobbit himself in Gollum. It's in this meeting Bilbo finds what would later become the most important thing in Middle Earth, THE RING.In a match of wits Bilbo out smarts Gollum and escapes from his clutches. Funny enough the thing that warned him of gollum was a sword he had found earlier that glows when things lurk about. Yet after his escape a reuniting with the others only leads to an attack from giant spiders, and being help captive by some elves. But after he manages to get out of those little binds he must now face Smaug.After entering threw a secret passage he usses the ring to hide from the dragon, which eventually leads to the dragon attacking the town down below untill he is hit with an arrow in a weak spot and killed. Things are over right, wrong now comes a war of giagantic proportions. Humans, dwarves, goblins, wolves, and birds all end up in the fight. and after it is all said and done Bilbo returnes home, RING included."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I think that The Hobbit was a great book! JRR Tolkien does a great job at keeping the plot moving and keeping the reader's attention. I liked how he constantly threw in unexpected events. For instance, when I thought that the book had come to an end, he added an extra part which kept me reading. I also liked how he wrote in some of his own comments about what Bilbo Baggins (the main character) felt and how he took the time to describe each and every one of the many dwarves one by one.One of my favorite characters in the book was Gandalf the Wizard. JRR Tolkien does a great job of describing Gandalf as wise, trustworthy, and powerful. He was the \\"glue\\" that held the group together and was always giving them advice and helping them get out of tight spots.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and science fiction. It tells a lot about what happened before the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Tolkein, is a book for everyone. It has comedy, jokes and riddles along with suspense and adventure for those who seek a good page turner. Tolkein tells you how the hobbit, Bilbo, came of the ring and had thirteen other companions to help find what the ring could do. It tells of their adventures against the giant spiders, evil wolves, orcs and much, much more. Even though he first wishes that he was home by his warm fire and on his soft bed, this adventure changes his life and the lives of his companions.

It is centered on a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is the Uncle of the Hero in the Lord of the Rings, Frodo. \\"The Hobbit\\" is about a group of traveling dwarves, the leader of which goes by the name of Thorin. Him and his band of 12 Dwarfs are on a quest to get back the treasure that belongs to them. Thorin's ansester by the name of Thror was known as the king of the mountains because him and his people discovered a great whealth in a mountain range that was thought unexplorable. One day an evil dragon by the name of Smaug came to Thror's kingdom and recklessly destroys all of Thror's people and steals the treasures that he worked so hard to obtain. Thorin and his men are looking for a Hobbit to join them on their quest to use him as a burglar since he has \\"Took\\" blood in him. (The Tooks were notoriously known for their spirit of adventure that most Hobbits lacked.) After some convincing from the Dwarves and his Wizzard friend Gandalf, he accepts the invitation. He must endure many hardships as he travles the monster infested land, fight off massive spiders, escape a 500 year old Hobbit that is deformed by the power of the \\"Ring\\", and slay an ancient Dragon that not a kingdom of men were powerless to stop!\\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R Tolkien is a national classic and a book that has inspired all of those who read it.

However, I ended up barely glancing at them once I hit the half-way point of the book. Most of them focused on Tolkien's literary inspiration for certain stories and characters and only a handful had the cross-referencing to the Lord of the Rings which I would have preferred.

I could have found the One Ring faster than try to follow the bad editing mistakes from one page to the next. I do not know how the written work is transferred from book to e-book, but when they did the Hobbit, someone hit the mead a bit early.

It is sheer example of a book that tells you a lot but don't confuse you with too much data.Every person that read the Annotated Hobbit will never again treat the Hobbit as a simple children's book. The Hobbit has depth and Anderson provides us with important insights, ideas and interesting data.The Annotated Hobbit also has the famous \\"missing chapter\\" that was included in the Hobbit's first edition. (i.e. the chapter where Gollum is showing Bilbo the way out and acts like an honest guy - Tolkien had to change that of course after he wrote the Lord of The Rings).Read this book and you will understand a lot more about The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings and J.R.R Tolkien himself."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book was a great way to get into the Tolkien series.

When I was 6 I listened to the tape and since then I have probably read the book 583 times. It has a superp story line which none absoulutely none of the several 100 other books I have read since can compare with. Okay Artemis Fowl was pretty good, well actually very good and so were the Harry Potter books but what other books can claim they have. A great storyline, Wizards, a hero who dosen't want to be one, Elves, Dragons and a richly satisfying ending? If there is a book I would really like to hear about it.The hero is the loveable character called Bilbo Baggins. He is of course a hobbit. As i'm sure pretty much every one knows what a hobbit is but for the benefit of the people who do not the foggiest idea what a hobbit is I will type the books explaination .If you have read the book don't bother reading this explanation if you don't wan't to.They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you or me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good- natured faces, and a laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).Many people say they prefer the hobbit to the Lord Of The Rings for two simple reasons.1) It is easier to read and a lot less complicated.2) It has a better story line.The hobbit is absoulutely fantastic! Any adults who haven't read this book need to read it or deserve to be PUNISHED!As for the people who rate this book below 5 stars they probably didn't read this book well enough or haven't read it at all.In conclusion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Hobbit,\\" J.R.R. Tolkien's classic of children's fantasy, is regarded as such for good reason - it is fun, light-hearted, full of adventure, episodic in nature and simply BEGS to be read out loud. All this combines for a perfect adventure tale.This annotated edition ads a slew of illustrations from throughout the world and dozens of annotations explaining the origins of names, details on early drafts and story ideas, and other interesting tidbits. The illustrations are wonderful, representing interpretations of Tolkien's text from a wide variety of cultures, and the annotations, while not providing knowledge vital to understanding \\"The Hobbit,\\" are interesting.Before reading &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; those fresh from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" should know in advance, the tone here is much lighter than the \`trilogy.' The writing is very much meant for children. That doesn't mean an adult can't enjoy this - adults read Harry Potter, after all - just that this is not cut from the same mold as \\"Rings.\\" Be prepared to read a children's book, because that's what this is.For those willing to plunge into children's fantasy, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a pure delight. Bilbo Baggins, a homebody of a hobbit (a small humanlike creature), is pulled into an adventure with a wizard, Gandalf, and a group of dwarves. Their quest is to venture across dangerous mountains and dark forests to reclaim treasure stolen by a terrible dragon, Smaug.What follows is a series of adventures that have our heroes meeting trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, elves and more. Each encounter is an adventure unto itself, with a thrilling climax that leads us to the next. The adventure is nonstop. Each chapter brings a new discovery.Fans of Middle Earth will find plenty to enjoy here. We see our first glimpses of Gollum and the One Ring. Elrond appears in Rivendell. We hear about Middle Earth's ancient lore, see the origins of famous swords like Sting, and meet dwarves who play a part in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The cross references will bring a smile to your face and will enhance your enjoyment of the famous trilogy. Just be prepared for the light, brisk tone.For those looking to explore Tolkien's world or simply looking for a good children's fantasy, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a no brainer.

It had never occurred to me that I'd read all the books in the LoTR trilogy and had somehow skipped over The Hobbit; it's unfortunate that I missed out all these years from such a great read. But it's a great time to read it now, with the movie coming out.Since it's been so long since I read the trilogy, I can't really compare writing style/differences between the two. But Tolkien certainly has his way of writing which gives you just the details and describes the environment. He also does a wonderful job of portraying the characters and the personalities and the cultural differences between men/dwarfs/elves/wizards/hobbits. As one reads, they truly feel like they're right there along with Bilbo experiencing this adventure.After reading this book, I am an even bigger fan of JRR Tolkien's writing and I absolutely cannot wait to go see the movie!!**I received this book as a gift**"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"What can I say about The Hobbit?

Tolkien is one of the greatest authors ever and if we're being honest, I'll stop being your friend if you say anything bad about his stories or him.It's been so long since I've read the Hobbit that it was like reading it for the first time. I forgot so much of it and I love Tolkien's way of telling a story. I laughed at many lines, grew to love each character and was reminded again that Tolkien was a genius. If you've never read the books, put them next on your list!He created a language, incredible story lines, creativity beyond most people and even today's famous books are influenced by his story (I love me some Harry Potter, but you can't help but notice the similarities with Lord of the Rings). I am so excited to see the movie coming out this weekend! Not sure how three movies will pan out, but I figure that's just more Tolkien radness on the big screen.After every read or re-read of Tolkien, I'm left with one single question: Is it too much to ask for Middle Earth to be real and for me to be an elf or rider of Rohan?I didn't think so either."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is great!

I've re-read it several times since. Having seen and enjoyed Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, I looked forward to the new movie(s???) based on this book.I think J.R.R. Tolkein, for all his foibles, would most likely not enjoy Mr. Jackson's current offering. I realize that MGM has now taken a stake in Mr. Jackson's films.... and with the current trend of making \\"franchise films\\", I should have known something was amok when I learned that \\"The Hobbit\\" was to be a two-movie offering. The embellishments on the original story, the addition of \\"bad guy\\" goblins and a whole battle scene that doesn't occur in the book had me wondering from the first half hour of the movie, if it would get back to the story as Tolkein wrote it. A character mentioned ONCE in the book (and just in passing) has two whole scenes devoted to him.This is not so much intended as a review of the movie as it is the book. Read.

I think (and if you read Tolkien's biography), that Tolkein started this prequil to the Lord of the Rings triliogy in a state of lymbo. Tolkien wanted to write this book (or story as it started out) in a manner so that his children could enjoy it. Nevertheless, when this story was started, many read it and were impressed by the imaginative descriptions that are in the book. People took interest, and the rest, they say, is history. Tolkien's character developments of both Bilbo and Gandalf seemed to be in this book, quite a bit more shallow then they later appeared in the following Lord of the Rings books. Tolkein had no idea where he was going with these books, and probably didn't even slightly consider the probility of continuing the Middle-Earth saga after the advent of the first book. Thus, as a result, Tolkein takes each character in the rest of the trilogy, and delves deep into the workings of their minds. Thus, the overall story turns into something epic, rather than your average fight-the-dragon-and-go-home-with-the-gold-later type of story. Tolkien was surely a master wordsmith, and will probably be considered for the rest of time. And only through Tolkien's imignation and variety do we get a great work like that of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have noticed that the people who have given this book a bad name have either had the book forced upon them by a teacher or just simply tried to be smart-asses.

It makes the rest of us, who have worshipped this book, feel really down to see people sink to such deph's. I hope they realize that The Hobbit was written by one of the greatest writers of our time. It is a book that will be rememberd for generations to come and all the people who spat on J.R.R Tolkiens work will be long forgotten.

High adventure for readers of any age awaits in these pages. An example, from my dog eared copy: While seeking shelter in a cave from a storm, Bilbo &quot;dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping--beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to. At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size. Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could say 'rocks and blocks.' There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two for Bilbo; and they were grabbed and carried through the crack before you could yell 'tinder and flint.'&quot; The Hobbit is unparalleled as a fantasy children's book, and is adored by adults as well.

It was difficult to find the basic Hobbit book since most of the selections revolved around the recent movie. We must remember to keep the classics available to readers."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"With Peter Jackson's movie, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, due to hit the theaters next weekend, I thought I'd do some homework and re-read the book.Normally I don't re-read books, because there's so many other stories I have yet to discover. Until now, I've only re-read two other tales, which were also in response to upcoming movie buzz: Starship Troopers and Lord of the Rings (which I count as one story).In this case, the version I chose to read was Douglas A. Anderson's The Annotated Hobbit, my sister gave me years ago. I first read The Hobbit way-back-when in junior high school and it was my first introduction to high fantasy literature. While I remembered the basic plot and all the major characters, there were a lot of details I've forgotten.Like The Hobbit was written for children in the UK back in 1937 (and was published a year later in the US). While the book is narrated as if it is being read aloud to children, the storyline is certainly one adults of all ages have enjoyed through the years--and continue to do so.This annotated version is especially interesting and helpful. There is a 28-page Introduction, which includes a short bio of J.R.R. Tolkien and a publishing history of the book (which makes up the bulk of the intro), along with some anecdotes on such things as runes and other mythological reference material.The narrative of The Hobbit itself is sandwiched between Anderson's copius footnotes. These sidebars contain information ranging from 1-sentence definitions to historical, literary and philological information, which can run for two or more pages.At first I was determined to read every footnote, so I could later brag about my scholarly knowledge of Middle Earth lore and Real Earth publishing history. But alas; I grew weary of having to step out of the story to read the sidebar stuff. So I limited my note-reading to only those items that interested me--and were a few sentences long. If I really need to know a piece of Tolkien trivia, I can look it up later."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.The main distinguishing characteristic of this edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" is apparently that, while unabridged, it's small. Very small. About four by six inches.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

But, as they are not sitting here at the computer with me just now, you'll have to take my word for that.By now, most of the civilized western world knows that The Hobbit is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings (which is even better, yet more accessible by older teens and adults than by children). I've always told the kids that I teach who read Harry Potter (and I'm a Potter fan, too), that when they're ready to \\"graduate their reading\\", The Hobbit is the next step. It has all the appeal of the best in \\"young\\" fiction, but it is absolutely \\"literary\\", too, in the most classic sense of that word. And well it should be. J.R.R. Tolkien was a student and teacher of linguistics himself, and his love of history (over allegory) is omnipresent in all of his works, not least in The Hobbit.It's the story of an unlikely and reluctant hero, Bilbo Baggins, who is unceremoniously roped into an adventure with thirteen dwarves. Their goal: traverse the whole of the Wilderlands in Northern Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain, defeat a dragon who stole the dwarves' treasure, and reclaim the kingdom under the mountain as their own.What follows is largely episodic in nature, as the first half of the book chronicles the various dangers and respites along the way (one per chapter until they reach the mountain itself). By chapter 8, not only have you met hobbits, dwarves, and wizards, you've outwitted trolls, dined with elves, evaded goblins, avoided being eaten alive by a nasty little subterranean fiend named Gollum, been rescued from the tops of burning trees by flying eagles, befriended a were-bear, and hacked down an army of giant spiders. And then, just when you've taken a breath, you realize the book is only half done ...To give any more away would be simply gratuitous. If you're a kid, read The Hobbit.

People would have had a better idea of who Bilbo was. The worst part about the movies was they made him look like a silly little old man. But this is a classic story of a rather ordinary little creature reaching out to be extraordinary when the situation required it. It is a mistake to think of this as a story about a small group of thirteen dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit out to fight a dragon merely to win back a treasure. This group is out to win back a lost kingdom. And it must be pointed that an elf kingdom and a kingdom of humans suffered from the fall of the dwarf kingdom as well. So it shouldn't be a surprise when a war breaks out because other people want a share of the treasure. This a bit lighter in tone than The Lord of the Rings, but it came twenty years earlier, and a lot happened to Tolkien in that time, including World War II.

Most of my students find it easier to follow along with a person reading aloud than when reading on their own; the problem is that if I am the one reading my attentions are on the book, and the classes can sometimes take that as a cue to misbehave!Enter the Hobbit on audio. This is an unabridged reading by classically trained actor Rob Inglis, who specializes in Shakespearean and Tolkien readings. His reading is consistent: his voice work stays the same for each character throughout the reading. A nice touch is the actual singing of the poetry Tolkien included. Music, songs, and poetry are an integral part of Tolkien's travel narratives, and the use of actual singing makes this reading a delight to listen to. Inglis's smooth voice is easy on the ears, and he performs this recording beautifully.My only complaint, and that of my students, was that sometimes the pace of the reading was too slow, which made tedious parts of the book even more so. Other than that it was a huge asset to my classroom, and truly served its purpose. While I don't really use audio books for personal use, I would still recommend this item to people who do.

It is great! Am I biased, of course; but does that change the beauty of this book, no!This is a great book for many reasons. I will give you three:1) Great English usage. Tolkien was a master of the English language and it shows in this book (maybe even more so than in the LoTR cycle). He is creative and concise. At times he is gives you lots of information and description, while at other times he is sparse; but either way he gives you just exactly what you need to know. When you read this book, note how Tolkien uses adverbs. For some odd reason the adverb is out of fashion to most fiction authors these days, thus, reading Tolkien is a breath of fresh air.2) The richness of the story is undeniable. This book set the bar for a modern fantasy staple: the quest story. Without \\"The Hobbit\\" there would be no Dark Tower, Drizzt, Demon Wars, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, etc. \\"The Hobbit\\" is and always will be the defining novel of the fantasy genre.3) It is fun! Hobbits are intriguing, the quest is exciting, and the interactions between the characters are authentic (even though they aren't human!).

You will love the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"So much has been written about J.R.R. Tolkien's works recently, in the wake of Peter Jackson's magnificent films, that it was refreshing to simply re-read Tolkien's original tale of Bilbo Baggins. This marvelous new edition provided the perfect excuse.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic tale of adventure. Bilbo Baggins, Esquire, of the Shire, has never done anything outlandish, and is a most esteemable hobbit as a result. But lo and behold, the wizard Gandalf arrives on his doorstep with thirteen dwarves on a quest for revenge. Although never made quite clear why or how, Gandalf knows that Bilbo is going on this quest, too, like it or not. And after a night of dwarvish tales to chill a hobbit's bones, Bilbo finds himself running out his front door on a quest without so much as a pocket-handerchief.Just what is the quest? The dwarves are refugees from the Lonely Mountain in the East, a mighty dwarf kingdom, that has been ransacked by the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Bilbo is the troop's Burglar, although one imagines that the only thing Bilbo has ever stolen is a nap, or perhaps an extra piece of pie.If you're going to do archetypal stuff, you must do it well. In \\"The Hobbit,\\" Tolkien sets the gold standard. His Middle-Earth is a fully realized land full of terrors and wonders, from trolls, goblins, evil wolves, giant spiders (not to mention Smaug or the ultimate nemesis, Gollum) to the shapeshifter Beorn, the Arkenstone, Bard the Archer, Sting, and Gandalf's wizardry on the other (not to mention a certain magic ring). Tolkien spends as much time on the landscape as he does the action or the dialogue, and his descriptions are so vivid one finds yourself walking alongside Bilbo through his amazing adventures.In contrast to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, which can generally be characterized as a heavy load, \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter. Tolkien tells this tale using a narrator who cleverly jumps ahead and back in the story to offer hints, clues, and humor . . . just as if your favorite uncle were telling you a tall tale on the couch when you were a wee lad.The story builds, and builds, and builds, but never loses steam. A tale that must be read, \\"The Hobbit\\" will surely earn a place of honor on your bookshelf.For devotees of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, you will find throughout \\"The Hobbit\\" somewhat veiled references to later events. A few references are made to \\"the Necromancer,\\" who never really figures in the story but plays, shall we say, a slightly larger role in the trilogy. A certain magic ring, used by Bilbo to great effect, does not seem to carry all the negative baggage that Bilbo's nephew will associate with it. And Gollum, well, you know all about Gollum. (Apparently Tolkein revised \\"The Hobbit\\" after working extensively on \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because Gollum unexpectedly became a major player in the trilogy.)And this edition is wonderful, too. Handsome green leatherette binding with heavy paper makes for a pleasant reading experience, and the artwork and maps (drawn by Tolkien himself!) just adds to the magic.You cannot go wrong giving this book to any Tolkien fan, or keeping it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Okay, if you've never in your life read an epic fantasy then you might like it. But still, when I read this book I was at a point where I was reading four hundred-page novels per two to three days, but it took me hours to get through the first couple chapters. It doesn't really make sense how the dwarves would want such a bumbling fool to help them. And anyway, dwarves and Hobbits, etc., etc. aren't exactly my favorite fantasy races.

I Heard that it was a timeless classic, so i payed a whopping $12 which could have easily better spent. For an adult to enjoy this novel is just beyond my belief. I am 14 myself and after reading it it was plainly ment for parents to read to their 6 or 7 year olds as they fall asleep. With such childish names almost always ryming with another (example: Dwalin and Balin, and also the very childish name of Bilbo) I would only purchase this book if i had someone i knew about 6-8 years old just to read it to them"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is perfect for anyone who reads to be transported out of the mundane world into the realm of possibility and ancient myth. The Hobbit was written for children but is delightfully engaging for adults as well. My advice is to pick up a copy and read it aloud to a child you love... You will instill in that child a love of all things magical and share a literary bond that is unbreakable. You cannot put a price on a gift like that!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I liked \\"The Hobbit because of three things. I liked the author's creativity. It was a nice little world in that book. I also liked the originality. Other books just copy some clay mold for a \\"good\\" book. Finally, I liked the characters. Did Tolkien invent the \\"hobbits\\"?The best part of this book is where the main charcter meets a creature named \\"gollum\\" and steals his magic ring. It was very suprising and very original. The description of the area just puts a picture in my head.One element I like best about this story is the characters. Even though there were about 15 characters, Tolkien gave each of them a personality. I also liked the resolution. It was close to real life because there were happy parts and tragic parts."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I think this is the best book Tolkien has ever written. The hobbit is the prequel of the great lord of the rings trilogy and gives it an indispensable background.This book talks about Bilbo Baggins, a young hobbit, which decides to go on a long journey, along with his friend Gandalf the wizard, to find about a great treasure guarded by the fierce dragon Smaug.This book gives the background info of most of the lord of the rings characters, Golem, Gandalf, Bilbo etc... and how the famous ring was actually found.A must have for all lord of the rings fans and for every other fantasy writing lover."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Once there was a brave hero who journeyed with his companions on a glorious quest to reclaim a lost treasure from an evil dragon! This would seem like a typical fantasy-adventure storyline, if it weren't for the fact that this \\"hero\\" were no more than three feet tall and had no experience in the ways of battle whatsoever. This is the story of The Hobbit by JRR Tolkein, and is the prelude to the famous Lord of the Rings novels. In this novel, Tolkein proves that anyone can accomplish a goal, regardless of his or her physical abilities.The story starts out very peaceful as the reader is introduced to the main character: Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a \\"Hobbit\\", which is a creature like a human but much shorter and with twice the appetite. He goes on with his life normally, until one day a wizard named Gandalf shows up at his door, and Bilbo embarks on the adventure of his lifetime (which is longer than a man's). Bilbo must travel with Gandalf and a group of dwarves to a mountain far away where a dragon called Smaug lies with an unimaginable fortune of treasure. The treasure originally belonged to the dwarves, but the dragon drove them away and claimed it for itself. Bilbo himself cannot see why he was chosen for this journey since he has never seen a battle in his life. However, he will soon learn that they chose him for a different reason. It would take an awfully small and clever creature to sneak past a dragon!One of the many exciting incidences in the novel is when giant trolls capture Bilbo and the dwarves. They are all tied up in sacks and desperately trying to find a way of getting out while the trolls decide how they should kill them. It seems hopeless for the courageous company before Gandalf shows up and rescues them. As the trolls are deciding how they will kill their catch, Gandalf hides in a bush behind them and starts to talk in on the trolls's conversation and causes them to quarrel. The trolls lose track of time arguing with each other, the sun rises, and they turn to stone. That is what happens when they come in contact with sunlight.Tolkein magnificently blends exciting adventure and action along with a climatic ending that will take you by surprise, and immerses you into a world that will not be able to come out of until you have read the very last word! This story is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkien you know few things compare. I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's writing. I've read the complete history of middle-earth, the silimarillion, the lord of the rings and this wonderful novel. The Hobbit remains my favourite of all time. No modern writers even come close (perhaps Robert Stanek but that's different). Read this, you are going to love it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I only recently (Today in fact) recieved this book, and I had no doubts in my mind as to whether it was worth the expense to have it shipped here (I am located in the republic Ireland). I could have simply gone to my local Easons (pretty much *the* only bookstore, of note, in Ireland) and picked up one of the many (and I'm talking millions here) paperback editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" (or The Lord of the Rings, as I bought both leatherette editions), but instead I chose the leatherette edition, and I'm not sorry, not in the least!I'll start by describing the 'externals' (or asthestics) of the book: Let me first say, dont be fooled into believing this is some 'form' of leather that the book is bound in, it is, in fact (or at least appears to be), a form of plastic. Saying this, however, it does not cheapen the book, I'm saying merely to clarify. This 'plastic' is actually made to look 100% like real leather, if only for the feel, you would be fooled into thinking it was leather (leather is less resitant, scratches more easily and is softer under-hand). I personally dont mind, the book is most beautifully crafted with 'simulation' gold gild (more than likely its a gold ink or paint).The pages themselves are of good, rather great -quality, not cheap 'bright-white' 'mass market' pages, but rather a subtle shade of mild yellow, not to mention the pages being almost twice as thick as paperback editions (if not, in fact thicker), which makes for a much more comfortable read. I have only one 'gripe' or 'probleme' with this book, and that is that the text that is printed on the pages seems to be at an angle (rather than being 90deg to the pages edge, the text seems to be off by about 3-5 degrees). This is only a slight annoyance, and I am not totally convinced that it is either an error while printing nor that all copies have the same 'condition'; I personally dont mind too much, but for the 'perfectionistic reader' it can be quite distracting, but to be honest that is the fault of the reader rather than the book's.Finally (and perhaps most importantly?),The book comes with a 'container' wich is, also, bound with 'leatherette', they both complement each other and the cover is a perfect protector against the day to day 'wear n tear' of life.Personally, I cant put the book down. I'm three chapters through and cant find fault in the book. All of this goes for the \\"Lord of the rings - Leatherette edition\\" just as much as for \\"The Hobbit - Leatherette edition\\".This book is a must for all!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My introduction to the world of Middle-Earth happened last year. I was never very enthusiastic about the world created by Tolkien, but when I finally read Lord of The Rings (which I'm actually still reading: I'm in the beginning of RotK) and The Hobbit last year, in 8th grade, I could''t be more impressed, and I'm an official Fantasy geek (and I mean this in a friendly way).The Hobbit is a fairy-tale like adventure, easy to read and told in a much less accurate and serious way than LoTR, one of the greatest Fantasy tales ever published. But don't take this book as a work of less importance, because though it is not as epic as LoTR, The Hobbit is a excellent book that can be used as an introduction to the world of Middle Earth, or as a separate tale. The book shows Tolkien doing what he seems to do best: it's an aventure full of carachter development, with both sad and lighter, even comic moments. Though this book isn't a epic war tale, it's a great and easy read, reccomended for everibody."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you are reading this you probably already know that a hobbit is a really fascinating epic story and the prequel of the lord of the rings.

I suppose that's a given when you replace so much of his expertly crafted words with pictures.If nothing else, read the standard version of the Hobbit first before trying this.

At once, I knew I'd hate that book! Who'd want to read about a midget who lives in a dirty hole? When I was in ninth grade, I decided to read it anyway. I discovered how wrong I was about hobbits! Hobbits are people just like you and me, only they're plumper and about two to four feet tall. Most have curly brown hair on their heads, and on the leathery soles of their feet to match! They live in the Shire, which is in Middle Earth, in little tunnels (which DON'T slope down, merely just go right into the heart of their hill) all panneled and decorated to look cozy and inviting. Their town is a very pretty place full of flowers and rolling green hills. Bilbo Baggins, a fairly young hobbit, is strangely greeted by Gandalf, an old wizard clad in blue-ish grey and a whole bunch of dwarves! Unexpectedly, Bilbo joins them on a journey to steal the gold back from the dragon who sits on the Lonely Mountain far, far away rich with all the dwarve's gold and jewels. But it is a long, perilous road they must take. They meet elves, trolls, goblins, and many other unlikely creatures along the way. You feel like you're one among them. Just imagine: You're captured by a tall, gruff troll in the middle of the night and stuffed into a dirty, smelly sack with twelve others and listen to the trolls quarrels of whether they should roast or mince you after they squash you . . ."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Tolkien is a genius and his Brilliant son Christopher should be commended for continuing his father's noble work.

There is a newer release, with a yellow cover, that packages this version of The Hobbit (1968) and The Lord of the Rings (1981) together with some bonus material. This is a full-cast audio drama originally developed for radio, not an audiobook. There are 8 episodes clocking in at a little under half an hour each.***This is a much-beloved adaptation with some serious flaws. It's easy to forget that it will be half a century old in a few years. It is presented in frequently abrasive mono sound, with dated effects, a few questionable casting choices, and more than a few questionable music choices.So why bother?Bilbo - that's why. Paul Daneman's Bilbo is clever, bumbling, endearing, and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious. In short, he is the perfect gentlehobbit. Much like Bill Nighy's Sam in the later Lord of the Rings radio production, Daneman is the overt inspiration for Martin Freeman's recent take on Bilbo in Peter Jackson's movies. Freeman does a great job, but the similarities are striking. In the end, Daneman's subtlety and sharpness set him apart as the greatest Bilbo interpreter.The rest of the cast for the most part dives in with great relish. There are unfortunately two glaring misfires: Gandalf and Gollum.Heron Carvic's Gandalf (interestingly pronounced \\"Gandalv\\" by most of the cast) is played as a sneering elite with a nasal drone. It is so vastly different from the great interpretations of Hordern and McKellen that it will probably take you out of the story the first few times he opens his mouth. Carvic is at least a perfectly serviceable actor, even if badly miscast, so you eventually get used to it.I can't really say the same for Gollum. Gollum is a tough character to play in an audio format, and even the fantastic later radio production of Lord of the Rings cannot escape the issue. Wolfe Morris hits the notes of manic schizophrenia just fine, but it is a screeching performance that is poorly served by the presentation. The audio is neither mixed nor compressed too carefully, so the dynamics allow Gollum's piercing wail to rise above the normal levels like a blaring commercial in the middle of a sedate TV show. The mastering leans heavily treble for the sake of clarity as well, due to technological issues with both the transmission and reproduction of radio programs at the time. In crisp digital audio on CD, it does Gollum no favors.Thankfully, Gollum is not in the story for long, and Gandalf's visits become more and more believable as the story draws on. Bilbo is there all the while, however, and his charm is a rock solid foundation for the rest of this aged, flawed, but ultimately delightful production."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I FIRST read the hobbits 47 years ago and I'll never tire of it.

The great dragon Smaug has been terrorizing the country and must be destroyed before his work of death can go any farther. Bilbo and the Dwarves go off to destroy this abomination. They are soon swept up in a quest filled with evil orcs, giant spiders, and much worse hidden dangers. Although Tolkien does well in describing the settings and characters, he doesn't really do too well with his action. Some authors, such as C.S. Lewis or J.K. Rowling, have the ability to create the sweeping kind of action that seems to just bring you along and keep you reading whether you like the story or not. J.R.R. Tolkien doesn't, no matter what you say. At the beginnning of the story, he seems to just drone on and on until by the time he's gotten to the point, you forget what he's really trying to say. Of course he does well in his description, but there is too much.

For those uninitiated with the lore and legend of Middle Earth, this book comes across as just another story of dragons, elves and dwarves set in a land that was probably medieval England post-Roman Empire. And there are the occasional songs and chants that break up the text. But the most important part of the story is the ring, which sets up the three Lord of the Rings books.

Afterward, our son wrote the following essay:Since The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was offered as an option for our family book club, I've been asking for it each month. In August, my pleas were granted, and we started the book well before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrives in theaters.A quick summary of \\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings\\": The comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins smokes his pipe, relaxes in his easy chair, watches the stars. He leads a peaceful life until Gandalf, an old white wizard, comes along and changes it forever. In spite of his Tookish ancestors, Mr. Baggins is a \\"lazy\\" hobbit who doesn't want adventures: \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them.\\" (p. 4) Of course, then, he is quite suprised when he is called to serve as a professional burglar for a band of thirteen dwarves. Later, he's even called upon to kill Smaug, a dragon with a diabolical appearance and a mammoth appetite. Of the thirteen dwarves, Thorin is the most eager to see Smaug die, for a few of the villages Smaug has destroyed were part of the kingdom of Thorin's fathers and forefathers, making Thorin the King Under the Mountain - not Smuag! With no choice but to join them, the hobbit has no idea of the dangers he must face to reach his goal, no idea how to kill a dragon (let alone a dragon who has been the glorious victor of who knows how many battles).My favorite part of their adventure takes place in the Elvenking's palace, when Bilbo is devising a plan to save the dwarves. He decides to put them all in barrels to be rafted off with the other empty barrels sent to \\"the Long Lake... a town of Men still throve there.\\" This plan gets them out of the castle without being seen. But, as Tolkien points out, \\"It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don't suppose you would have done half as well as him yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there any one to pack him in, even if there had been a chance!\\" (p.182)The mastermind of this journey, J.R.R. Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) were friends, colleagues, and masters of fantasy. We can see the influence of the Chronicles on the many series written for younger readers today. Tolkien's influence can be seen in series that appeal to more advanced readers; The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are the \\"granddaddy\\" of the sci-fi/fantasy genre.In The Hobbit, Tolkien relies on the power of the mythological \\"hero's journey.\\" Bilbo has a lot in common with Odysseus of Homer's Odyssey (perhaps the original hero) and Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars epic, a hero whose story was told four decades after Bilbo's. Hero stories teach us about our own potential. Heroes are called to journey and adventure for their heart's desire (Bilbo and Odysseus both want to return home, for example), but they must fight evil and learn about themselves before they can achieve their goals. Each of the heroes I mentioned are guided by mentors or wise guides: Odysseus by Athene, Luke by Obi-Won, and Bilbo by Gandalf. They each benefit from a magical talisman or sacred object: Odysseus has his magical bow and quiver of arrows and assorted amulets Athene and others provide during his twenty-year journey home; Luke Skywalker wields his father's lightsaber; and Bilbo has Sting, a short sword made by Elves, and the invisibility ring. In each of their stories, the hero must enter the \\"underworld,\\" a classic mythological detail. They are also encounter ugly, horrible beasts on land and in water, adding chilling action and, in some cases, humor to the stories. The heroes also, I might add, eventually achieve their goals.The Fellowship of the Rings is our next book club selection. I look forward to more of the same exciting and enchanting elements that made The Hobbit so memorable."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"On of the greatest books I have ever read was The Hobbit by J.R.R. Talkie. It takes you on an amazing journey through a fantasy world of mythical creatures and such. It is the prequel to the more famous Lord of the Rings trilogy. It has been around for more than 30 years and is still considered a work of greatness.In this book you go on an adventure with the main character Bilbo Baggins. He is a hobbit who lives in a hole by himself. He goes on a journey with a wizard named Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. He travels many miles to find gold to steal from a dragon named Smaug. Along his way he finds a ring with magical powers that is very powerful. This ring chances his life for ever and helps him steal the gold from the dragon. The Dwarves want to get there home land back from the dragon. He later returns to his hobbit hole very wealthy and a different person from when he left. The Ring in which he holds is very important for the survival of the hobbits. I felt that this book really held your interest with the amazing things it had. The most amazing thing is that Bilbo Baggins is only a hobbit who is able to steal the gold from the Dragon. This book sets up the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy which is very important. It is a book in which anyone from any age group can enjoy.Basically this book is suitable for anybody who enjoys fantasy and also enjoyed Lord of the Rings. If you were confused reading Lord of the Rings, you should try reading The Hobbit which explains the main story of what happened before. Many professional book reviews except this piece of literature as one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Have you ever heard of a hobbit? A hobbit is a small wooly footed creature. They don't wear shoes because they have thick soles that form on the bottom of their feet. They have curly brown hair like the stuff on their feet. Some people call them hole dwellers because they live in holes.Now that you have learned what a hobbit is, I shall tell you about one particular hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. This hobbit lives in a place called Hobbiton or the Shire if you like. Anyway, this hobbit is about to go on an adventure with thirteen dwarves and one wizard named Gandalf. The dwarves are trying to get their gold back from an evil dragon named Smaug. Will they succeed? I'll tell you one thing, this is one adventure that will change this hobbits life forever.I love this book. I have read it over and over again and I still can't get enough. It has so much action, adventure, and it's hilarious. You will adore this book and want to read it over and over again. I would think that older kids might enjoy this book more than younger kids. For instance five year olds; or two year olds would not understand it very well. But older kids like nine or older would most definitely love this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is amazing. I love the depth of the details it offers, plus all the photos and illustrations... It gives a very interesting and deep perspective of the Hobbit's/Tolkien's world.However, all that extra info kinda gets in the way if you are reading the story and want to get lost in it.Really something you do not want when reading it for the first time.Highly recommended if you want to go deeper though :)For the rest of you, I would recommend the 70th Anniversary Edition [Hardcover]"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Did you have to read the Hobbit when you were in school? There is so much to this story that is missed when you first read it for plot, which is typically what is done when you read something for your High School English class. This time, enjoy a slower pace and drink in the awesome details and background to one of the jewls of the English language literature. The increidible journey of 13 dwarves and one hobbit, which became the spark and foundation for the Lord of the Rings, is rich in detail that will only enhance your appreciation for these amazing stories. This particular edition contains illustrations and passages, which are later linked to the Lord of the Rings. The illustrations are Tolkien's own and I was delighted when I watched the movie and found them come to life in the big screen.

The vibrancy, the realistic character portrayal, the in depth descriptions and the sheer imagination and fortitude it took to concoct these imaginary lands is astounding. Whether you appreciate the fantasy genre or not, this classic book series is in a class by itself. This is one of those rare books - like the Harry Potter novels - that one can read over and over and never get bored of. It can take a bit of time to get used to the &#34;Middle English&#34; language (read: much like old English) however, once you get used to it is becomes smooth sailing. The plot is engaging and you find yourself caring about the characters very easily. Tolkien was a true master of the story telling art. The Audible reading (by Inglis) is really a treat as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It was disappointing to me what the movie producers did to this book!

It contains many illustrations in the book which make it that much nicer."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've already whined about not being able to give six stars out of five to \\"A Christmas Carol\\", given how much better it is than other books that I've rated five stars; given that this book is better than that one, (or at least, more fun, anyway) can I rate this one seven stars?Seriously, this book is one of the most enjoyable stories ever told. With all the attention that the new movie series is bringing to Tolkien's writings, there is a resurgence of interest in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but a great many of the newfound fans are failing to start with \\"The Hobbit\\", and this is a mistake; this book is a great deal easier to get into than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and once you're read this one, you'll likely find it much easier to enjoy that one.Granted, there are people who like \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but aren't fond of this book because they feel patronized by the easy, \\"children's book\\" writing style. If you don't enjoy \\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" or C.S. Lewis's \\"Narnia\\" series (and if what you object to in the \\"Narnia\\" series is the writing style, rather than the blatant Christian symbolism) then you may not care for this book. If, on the other hand, you enjoy an occasional romp in a light-hearted style that still has serious plot, characterization, and deeper meanings, rather than insisting that all of your literature act its age and take itself (and the world) seriously, there are few books more enjoyable than this one."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a fantasy book written by J.R.R.

Mr. Baggins has many different encounters with trolls, elves, and giant spiders, and finds himself close to death more than once. At the end of the book Bilbo and his companions reach the cave where the dwarf's treasure lies. After the dragon guarding the cave is slain they reclaim the treasure with a little bit of trouble. The book is well written and once you start reading it, you will have trouble putting it down.

I have read The Lord of the Rings before, and The Hobbit is an excellent edition that precedes the expectations that unfold in The Lord of the Rings. With many features and more unfolding of past, present, and future which J.R.R. Tolkien has always been successful of invoking; it is a tale that Bilbo Baggins, the most lucky and entertaining beast out of the peaceful Shire to ever save lives, fight evil creatures, and win his way out of getting eatin' alive. I best love The Hobbit for its many attributions to new characters and places rediscovered again. The Hobbit is an equal success as to his famous trilogy and sequel, The Lord of the Rings.

Not only are these things deadly but the land itself can also be filled with traps and other twists and turns. But fear not, for there are people who try to defend Middle Earth from such things, such as the elves of Elrond, dwarves of Morlia and other men of Middle Earth.

Tolkien 5 years ago, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is magical tale that will delight audiences of all ages.

Telling a story of how one small individual makes a BIG (especially in view of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;) impact on the world, this story is an inspiration as well as a captivating story.

Ready to leap right into the middles of a world full of magaic, danger, wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, dragons, and little people no taller than three feet? Searching for a book where the hero is the one who appears to be unlikely or unworthy of the title hero? Then the hobbit is the perfect choice to fulfill your reading desires. It is a tale of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, venturing out into the great big world. He takes risks, makes new life long friendships, and grows more mature and wise on his journey. Just when you things can't get possibily any worse, they do. The book presents a life learning lesson, that life isn't worth living if you don't explore it and get out into the world. In doing so you are setting goals for yourself, you never know what to expect but in the end you are a better person for getting out there. I thought this book was great! I recommend it, if one has the patience and the understanding to read it. It is the book right before The Lord Of The Rings. It introduces some of the characters in the up coming books. Tolkien is an extraordinary author, his words put me right in the story. The images were brought to life through is his words. This book is a must.
