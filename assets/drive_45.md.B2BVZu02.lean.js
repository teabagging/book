Teachers can use this book to explore any facet or era of poetry. Any reader can use it as an entryway into the art of poetry. Teaching the Art of Poetry shows poetry as a multi-faceted artistic process rather than a mystery on a pedestal. It demystifies the art of poetry by providing specific historical, social, and aesthetic contexts for each element of the art. It is a nuts-and-bolts approach that encourages teachers and students to work with poetry as a studio art--something to be explored, challenged, assembled and reassembled, imagined, and studied--all the things that an artist does to present poetry as a search for meaning. This book advocates poetry as an essential tool for aesthetic, cultural, and linguistic literacy. It portrays poetry as an art rather than a knowledge base, and methods for integrating the art of poetry into the school curriculum. The authors' intention is not to fill gaps; it is to change how poetry is presented in the classroom, to change how it is taught and how students think about it. Teaching the Art of Poetry: * Emphasizes hands-on experiences. Over 160 exercises focus attention on the dynamics of the art of poetry. Activities include group work, peer editing, critical thinking skills, revising drafts, focused reading, oral communication, listening skills, and vocabulary, as well as mechanics and usage. * Features a week-long lesson plan in each chapter to aid the teacher. These relate the main aspects of each chapter to classroom activities and, in addition, include a \\"Beyond the Week\\" section to promote further investigation of the topic. * Promotes an integrated approach to poetry. The examples used in each chapter show poetry as a living tradition. * Makes extensive use of complete poems along with extracts from many others. * Does not talk down to teachers--is teacher oriented and jargon free.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w3yRAgAAQBAJ&dq=Teaching+the+Art+of+Poetry:+The+Moves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zS0ftwAACAAJ&dq=Dil+Ne+Jise+Apna+Kahaa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creation vs. Evolution: What You Need to Know","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ps3eEU8QMTAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tale of Custard the Dragon","description":"In this humorous poem, Custard the cowardly dragon saves the day when a pirate threatens Belinda and her pet animals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OKcwHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Tale+of+Custard+the+Dragon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Bequest (Brewster Baby Boom) (Harlequin Romance)","description":"The Baby Bequest by Susan Meier released on Dec 24, 1999 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QCqzyk4q3mwC&dq=Baby+Bequest+(Brewster+Baby+Boom)+(Harlequin+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kelly Miller's History of the World War for Human Rights - 2 VOLUMES (1 Regular Book & 1 Salesman Sample)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tV8bAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Answer: A Fable for Our Times","description":"In this ingenious and unforgettable twentieth-century parable, a world on the brink of war is thrown into chaos when angels fall from heaven Major General Marcus Scott is a seasoned veteran of combat, a loyal American, and a skeptic in a volatile world.

The new style is reflected in a panoply of Community Economic Development (ced) initiatives efforts led by locally-based organizations to develop housing, jobs, and business opportunities in low-income neighborhoods. In this book William H. Simon provides the first comprehensive examination of the evolution of Community Economic Development, complete with an analysis of its operating premises and strategies. He describes the profusion of new institutional forms that have arisen from the movement, amalgamations that cut across conventional distinctions such as those between private and public and that encompass the efforts of nonprofits, cooperatives, churches, business corporations, and public agencies. Combining local political mobilization with entrepreneurial initiative and electoral accountability with market competition, this phenomenon has catalyzed new forms of property rights designed to motivate investment and civic participation while curbing the dangers of speculation and middle-class flight. With its examination of many localities and its appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the prevailing approach to Community Economic Development, this book will be a valuable resource for local housing, job, and business development officials; community activists; and students of law, business, and social policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FuSVku24-0kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karma On Tap: The Online Buddhist Revolution","description":"Spiritual evolution takes a quantum leap in this tale of a future Buddha who embraces high technology to help liberate the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bulskJ_0S7cC&dq=Karma+On+Tap:+The+Online+Buddhist+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Convergence Phase 2: A Field Guide for Creator-Collaborators","description":"This book clarifies and explains the convergence of computing, digital communications technology and digital media.

Here it all is the tactics, the movement, the truth about warfare.   The Civil War Times In Antietam: The Soldiers  Battle, historian John Michael Priest tells this brutal tale of slaughter from an entirely new point of view: that of the common enlisted man. Concentrating on the days of actual battle September 16, 17, and 18, 1862 Priest vividly brings to life the fear, the horror, and the profound courage that soldiers displayed, from the first Federal cavalry probe of the Confederate lines to the last skirmish on the streets of Sharpsburg. Antietam is not a book about generals and their grand strategies, but rather concerns men such as the Pennsylvanian corporal who lied to receive the Medal of Honor; the Virginian who lay unattended on the battlefield through most of the second day of fighting, his arm shattered from a Union artillery shell; the Confederate surgeon who wrote to the sweetheart he left behind enemy lines in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that he had seen so much death and suffering that his  head had whitened and my very soul turned to stone.  Besides being a gripping tale charged with the immediacy of firsthand accounts of the fighting, Antietam also dispels many misconceptions long held by historians and Civil War buffs alike. Seventy-two detailed maps which describe the battle in the hourly and quarter-hourly formats established by the Cope Maps of 1904 together with rarely-seen photographs and his own intimate knowledge of the Antietam terrain, allow Priest to offer a substantially new interpretation of what actually happened.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IKi9AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Book of Psalms: Exploring the Prayers of Ancient Israel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Good News Bible: English Version- Flex Burgundy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Here Comes the Year","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Regency Buck","description":"An altogether unsatisfactory arrangement After their father's death, Miss Judith Taverner and her brother Peregrine travel to London to meet their guardian, Lord Worth, expecting an elderly gentleman.

With deep roots in classic and medieval literatures, and great achievements in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, the genre of the short story, which benefits from the linguistic tightness of poetry and the narrative comforts of the novel, has finally been recognised as having a (hybrid) identity of its own.

The first edition included stories by twelve writers: Pilar Cibreiro, Cristina Fernaandez Cubas, Paloma Daiaz-Mas, Adelaida Garcaia Morales, Lourdes Ortiz, Laura Freixas, Marina Mayoral, Mercedes Abad, Rosa Montero, Maruja Torres, Soledad Puaertolas and Maraia Eugenia Salaverri.

A charismatic, obstinate leader, Simon soon lost patience with the king's incompetence and inability to keep his word, and found himself the champion of the common people. This is his story, and the story of Henry III, as weak and changeable as Simon was brash and unbending.

Beard's main argument is that both Democratic and Republican leaders, but Roosevelt above all, worked quietly in 1940 and 1941 to insinuate the United States into the Second World War. Basing his work on available congressional records and administrative reports, Beard concludes that FDR's image as a neutral, peace-loving leader was a smokescreen, behind which he planned for war against Germany and Japan even well before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Beard contends that the distinction between aiding allies in Europe like Great Britain and maintaining strict neutrality with respect to nations like Germany and Japan was untenable. Beard does not argue that all nations were alike, or that some did and others did not merit American support, but rather that Roosevelt chose to aid Great Britain secretly and unconstitutionally rather than making the case to the American public. President Roosevelt shifted from a policy of neutrality to one of armed intervention, but he did so without surrendering the appearance, the fiction of neutrality. This core argument makes the work no less explosive in 2003 than it was when first issued in 1948.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KwJKtAEACAAJ&dq=President+Roosevelt+and+the+Coming+of+the+War,+1941:+Appearances+and+Realities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Mule","description":"Political scientists and social choice theorists often assume that economic diversification within a group produces divergent political beliefs and behaviors. Michael Dawson demonstrates, however, that the growth of a black middle class has left race as the dominant influence on African- American politics.

To account for this phenomenon, Dawson develops a new theory of group interests that emphasizes perceptions of \\"linked fates\\" and black economic subordination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WOfaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Revenger's Tragedy, Second Edition (New Mermaids)","description":"\\"Oh do not jest thy doom\\" The Revenger's Tragedy is an intense tragic burlesque. Its hero, Vindice, desires to avenge the death of his betrothed. Operating in disguises he provokes discord among his enemies so that they plot against each other. It is an anonymous masterpiece (the play was entered in the Stationer's Register on 7th October 1607 without an author being named) produced at a crucial phase in Jacobean theatre with Hamlet, The Malcontent, Measure for Measure, Volpone and King Lear all recently performed. Written with vivid imagery, the play contains energetic, high-spirited action and brooding, slow-paced scenes on the subjects of death, revenge and evil, culminating in an unexpected ironic climax. This new student edition contains a completely re-edited text of the play and a new Introduction examining this unique combination of poetic tragedy, macabre farce and satire, focused on the dark brilliance of the hero Vindice. It also views the play in wider contexts - of contemporary attitudes to women, as well as contemporary debates concerning rebellion against tyranny.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l0CJAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sales Letters Ready To Go!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Narrative of Sojourner Truth: A Bondswoman of Olden Time, With a History of Her Labors and Correspondence Drawn from Her \\"Book of Life\\" (Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers)","description":"\\"A dictated autobiography written by Olive Gilbert\\"--Introd.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hNVmFvaBOm0C&dq=Narrative+of+Sojourner+Truth:+A+Bondswoman+of+Olden+Time,+With+a+History+of+Her+Labors+and+Correspondence+Drawn+from+Her+%22Book+of+Life%22+(Schomburg+Library+of+Nineteenth-Century+Black+Women+Writers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology (2 Volume Set)","description":"This modern dogmatics text is invaluable for Lutheran pastors, teachers, professors and Christians who desire to arrive at a deeper understanding of the Lutheran confession of the faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gDSijgEACAAJ&dq=Systematic+Theology+(2+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Trap","description":"Focusing on twenty major obstacles to effective time management, a guide to using time well offers practical solutions to the problem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eVErzXucFk8C&dq=Time+Trap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Racing Through the Century: The Story of Thoroughbred Racing in America","description":"A lively tour of twentieth-century horse racing takes readers inside the exciting world of thoroughbreds, race tracks, and high-stakes betting and horse breeding, accompanied by more than 165 black-and-white and full-color photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qnwUAQAAMAAJ&dq=Racing+Through+the+Century:+The+Story+of+Thoroughbred+Racing+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rape offenders and their victims,","description":"Presents a realistic examination of the crime's inplications from the points of view of rapists, victims, police, lawyers, physicians, and psychiatrists","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IesYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Rape+offenders+and+their+victims,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New History of Florida","description":"The New History of Florida, the first comprehensive history of the state to be written in a quarter of a century, is the culmination of the most recent and significant work from a galaxy of specialists. Each of the 22 chapters, which weave together in one continuous narrative, was written especially for this volume. Their authors present here not only political, economic, military, and religious information but also social history and personal experiences. Endnotes and a bibliography are appended to each chapter. Florida's first inhabitants entered the peninsula and panhandle about 10,000 years ago. The Spaniard Juan Ponce de Le n stumbled ashore near Melbourne Beach in 1513. He called the place La Florida, the first permanent geographic name of European origin to be etched upon the maps of the American continent. Over three centuries of Spanish and English colonial history followed before the United States acquired Florida in 1821. The first state flag was raised over a new capitol in Tallahassee on May 26, 1845. Written to observe the sesquicentennial of statehood, this work will document the rich history of the Sunshine State for general readers, students, and scholars well into the twenty-first century.

For centuries historians have offered often bitterly contradictory answers. Although Cranmer was a key participant in the changes to English life brought about by the Reformation, his reticent nature and lack of extensive personal writings have left a vacuum that in the past has too often been filled by scholarly prejudice or presumption. For the first time, however, this book examines in-depth little used manuscript sources to reconstruct Cranmer's theological development on the crucial Protestant doctrine of justification. The author explores Cranmer's cultural heritage, why he would have been attracted to Luther's thought, and then provides convincing evidence for the Reformed Protestant Augustinianism which Cranmer enshrined in the formularies of the Church of England. For Cranmer the glory of God was his love for the unworthy; the heart of theology was proclaiming this truth through word and sacrament. Hence, the focus of both was on the life of on-going repentance, remembering God's gracious love inspired grateful human love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-aVWHGKe_EC&dq=Thomas+Cranmer%27s+Doctrine+of+Repentance:+Renewing+the+Power+to+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The government inspector (World theatre series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5X59AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+government+inspector+(World+theatre+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The works of Victor Hugo","description":"Victor Hugo is often regarded as one of the greatest French writers of all time.

Rhea completes his much-lauded history of the Overland Campaign, a series of Civil War battles fought between Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee in southeastern Virginia in the spring of 1864. Having previously covered the campaign in his magisterial volumes on The Battle of the Wilderness, The Battles for Spotsylvania Court House and the Road to Yellow Tavern, To the North Anna River, and Cold Harbor, Rhea ends this series with a comprehensive account of the last twelve days of the campaign, which concluded with the beginning of the siege of Petersburg. On to Petersburg follows the Union army s movement to the James River, the military response from the Confederates, and the initial assault on Petersburg, which Rhea suggests marked the true end of the Overland Campaign. Beginning his account in the immediate aftermath of Grant s three-day attack on Confederate troops at Cold Harbor, Rhea argues that the Union general s primary goal was not as often supposed to take Richmond, but rather to destroy Lee s army by closing off its retreat routes and disrupting its supply chains. While Grant struggled at times to communicate strategic objectives to his subordinates and to adapt his army to a faster-paced, more flexible style of warfare, Rhea suggests that the general successfully shifted the military landscape in the Union s favor. On the rebel side, Lee and his staff predicted rightly that Grant would attempt to cross the James River and lay siege to the Army of Northern Virginia while simultaneously targeting Confederate supply lines. Rhea examines how Lee, facing a better-provisioned army whose troops outnumbered Lee s two to one, consistently fought the Union army to an impasse, employing risky, innovative field tactics to counter Grant s forces. Like the four volumes that preceded it, On to Petersburg represents decades of research and scholarship and will stand as the most authoritative history of the final battles in the campaign.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qa6PDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam in Ethiopia","description":"First Published in 2004.

But in 1960, noting the prevalence of aging frame houses and  substandard  conditions such as outdoor toilets, voters decided that Vinegar Hill would be redeveloped. Charlottesville s black residents lost a cultural center, largely because they were deprived of a voice in government. Vinegar Hill s displaced residents discuss the loss of homes and businesses and the impact of the project on black life in Charlottesville.

Millions more fell victim to forced labor, deportation, famine, bloody massacres, and detention and interrogation by Stalin's henchmen. Stalin's Genocides is the chilling story of these crimes. The book puts forward the important argument that brutal mass killings under Stalin in the 1930s were indeed acts of genocide and that the Soviet dictator himself was behind them. Norman Naimark, one of our most respected authorities on the Soviet era, challenges the widely held notion that Stalin's crimes do not constitute genocide, which the United Nations defines as the premeditated killing of a group of people because of their race, religion, or inherent national qualities. In this gripping book, Naimark explains how Stalin became a pitiless mass killer. He looks at the most consequential and harrowing episodes of Stalin's systematic destruction of his own populace--the liquidation and repression of the so-called kulaks, the Ukrainian famine, the purge of nationalities, and the Great Terror--and examines them in light of other genocides in history. In addition, Naimark compares Stalin's crimes with those of the most notorious genocidal killer of them all, Adolf Hitler.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F3UwF1eqb0AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Waiting Dog","description":"The book reveals a dog's ultimate Fantasy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vjZaAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Waiting+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek Bronzes in the Metropolitan Museum of Art","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WydYmgEACAAJ&dq=Greek+Bronzes+in+the+Metropolitan+Museum+of+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free admission","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sDhkAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dolphin Adventure:: A True Story","description":"Eighty feet below the ocean's surface, Wayne Grover hears a clicking sound.

Few of its outraged critics anticipated the onset of another world war with its Holocaust and atomic ruin.

The setting is Los Angeles where a \\"rediscovery expedition\\" from New Zealand is trying to make sense of what is left. From chief botanist Alfred Poole we learn, to our dismay, about the twenty-second-century way of life. \\"It was inevitable that Mr. Huxley should have written this book: one could almost have seen it since Hiroshima is the necessary sequel to Brave New World.\\" Alfred Kazin. \\"The book has a certain awesome impressiveness; its sheer intractable bitterness cannot but affect the reader.\\" Time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z5Q4UskBX0MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 1 (Re-Mastered)","description":"Since 1973, TEXAS MONTHLY has chronicled life in contemporary Texas, reporting on vital issues such as politics, the environment, industry, and education.

East River  is a novel by Sholem Asch, first published in 1946, and a New York Times bestseller of that year. Unlike the denser Jewish pockets of the lower East Side of New York, East 48th Street by the river was, even at the beginning of the twentieth century, an international neighborhood made up of Orthodox Jews, Catholic Irish, nostalgic Poles, chauvinistic Italians, all hungry, all overworked, all insecure. But although these folk were all, so to speak, melting in the same pot, they were kept at a certain distance from one another, by their inherited prejudices, the most pernicious of which were supplied by their religions. To allow them to live together and work together toward a happier life, and to turn them from their European pasts toward a high American future, they needed, in Asch s view, the religion of love. And the same religion was needed to get the bosses and workers together in the garment industry, so as to end the sweatshops, the subcontracting system, and destructive strikes. Set in the diverse, impoverished neighborhood of 48th Street and the East River in Manhattan, during the years before World War I, Asch s novel is a captivating tale of the inevitable and wrenching consequences of peaceful coexistence between Jews and Christians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yAQqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Type VII U-Boats","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ANNA: A Friend of Mathias","description":"Struggles of 3 immigrants to the US during 1891-1926.

Synthesis is essential to phenomenological description. But what does it mean to say that one experience is combined with others? This monograph is a speculative-exegetical Husserlian analysis of the ground, the mechanisms, and the results of synthesis. Focusing on Husserl's Logical Investigations, I argue that synthesizing consciousness must be a self-propelling, self-explicating system of interpretative acts driven by ongoing forward and backward references, grounding its structures as it proceeds, and positing its origins as that which must have been given \\"in advance\\". To this end, I develop a dialectical reading of Husserl's largely untreated category of \\"referring backward\\" (zur ckweisen). Treatments of Husserl's concept of synthesis have tended to focus on Husserl's later work on passive synthesis. By drawing out the centrality of the concept of synthesis in the Logical Investigations, I show how synthesis is at the foundation of intentionality as such, and also indicate the continuity of descriptive categories that run through both the early and the late Husserl. The Introduction to this study schematizes the modem history of the concept of synthesis, and reviews the secondary literature on Husserl's concept of synthesis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C-ssBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare Without Tears","description":"Covers Elizabethan theater, later changes in theatrical practice, scholarly interpretations, staging problems, analysis of principal characters. \\"Not an obscure or otherwise dull page in the book.\\"   N.Y.

This is the story of a man who, like Nat Turner, Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X, is a complex yet seminal hero in the history of African American emancipation. Denmark Vesey was a charasmatic ex-slave--literate, professional, and relatively well-off--who had purchased his own freedom with the winnings from a lottery. Inspired by the success of the revolutionary black republic in Haiti, he persuaded some nine thousand slaves to join him in a revolt. On a June evening in 1822, having gathered guns, and daggers, they were to converge on Charleston, South Carolina, take the city's arsenal, murder the populace, burn the city, and escape by ship to Haiti or Africa. When the uprising was betrayed, Vesey and seventy-seven of his followers were executed, the matter hushed by Charleston's elite for fear of further rebellion. Compelling, informative, and often disturbing, this book is essential to a fuller understanding of the struggle against slavery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c_98WSvh6s8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House On Hackman's Hill","description":"For use in schools and libraries only.

Few other authors have created as many characters and situations that so painstakingly and memorably recreate the social conventions, tastes, manners, and habits of speech of a particular era. This book, the most comprehensive single-volume reference work on Dickens ever produced, provides quick access to an enormous range of information about Dickens's writings and literary career. The Dickens Index consists of over 5000 entries arranged alphabetically and referenced by chapter rather than page number so that they work well with any edition. Thus, the Index can be used either in tandem with a particular work--to check allusions, unfamiliar quotations, obsolete words and slang, and topical, historical, and topographical references--or as an independent guide for looking up characters, both real and fictional, other writers whom Dickens quotes, and institutions to which he refers. But The Dickens Index does much more. It includes: *Entries on individual works that describe main themes, unique features, and bibliographical details of first publication *Over 1,400 entries on individual characters that describe the plots in which they function *Numerous cumulative entries that bring together for the first time Dickens's quotations and allusions (by author and title), his use of such genres as nursery rhyme, and his references to places and institutions *Full coverage of Dickens's publishers and illustrators *An illuminating time chart that juxtaposes events inDickens's personal and professional life with those in the wider world *An appendix covering Dickens's journalism, listing titles, subject matter, and first publication of those writings not covered in the Index itself. All Dickens enthusiasts, as well as teachers and students, will find this a handy reference work to accompany their reading, and those engaged in literary or historical research will find it an invaluable and time-saving tool.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VV3pUMDGIJ8C&dq=The+Dickens+Index&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garden At Levens","description":"At Levens Hall in the Lake District are the most famous and elaborate topiary gardens in Britian.

NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS  CHOICE ? An enduring account of joy and sorrow from one of the great writers of our time, The New Yorker s Kathryn Schulz, winner of the Pulitzer Prize  I will stake my reputation on you being blown away by Lost & Found. It is brilliant and profound and charming, all at once.  Anne Lamott, author of Dusk, Night, Dawn and Bird by Bird ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022 Oprah Daily, The Washington Post, Vogue, Los Angeles Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, BuzzFeed, Esquire, Chicago Review of Books, Town & Country, Electric Lit, The Millions, Lambda Literary, The Rumpus, Lit Hub, The Week, Kirkus Reviews Eighteen months before Kathryn Schulz s beloved father died, she met the woman she would marry. In Lost & Found, she weaves the stories of those relationships into a brilliant exploration of how all our lives are shaped by loss and discovery from the maddening disappearance of everyday objects to the sweeping devastations of war, pandemic, and natural disaster; from finding new planets to falling in love. Three very different American families form the heart of Lost & Found: the one that made Schulz s father, a charming, brilliant, absentminded Jewish refugee; the one that made her partner, an equally brilliant farmer s daughter and devout Christian; and the one she herself makes through marriage. But Schulz is also attentive to other, more universal kinds of conjunction: how private happiness can coexist with global catastrophe, how we get irritated with those we adore, how love and loss are themselves unavoidably inseparable. The resulting book is part memoir, part guidebook to living in a world that is simultaneously full of wonder and joy and wretchedness and suffering a world that always demands both our gratitude and our grief. A staff writer at The New Yorker and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Kathryn Schulz writes with curiosity, tenderness, erudition, and wit about our finite yet infinitely complicated lives. Crafted with the emotional clarity of C. S. Lewis and the intellectual force of Susan Sontag, Lost & Found is an uncommon book about common experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eJgoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Polar Bears: Monty's Left Flank, from Normandy to the Relief of Holland with the 49th Division (British Army Divisional Histories Series)","description":"Originally a Territorial unit with its roots in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the 49th Infantry Division saw action in the ill-fated Norwegian campaign in 1940, before it was appointed to garrison Iceland where it stayed for two years. In August 1944, under the command of the Canadian Army, the Polar Bears acted as Monty's left flank after the invasion of France. Following the battle for Normandy, the Polar Bears played a key role in the capture of Le Havre, campaigned vigorously in Belgium and garrisoned the 'island' between Arnhem and Nijmegen during the winter of 1944. They helped to take Arnhem and then liberated Utrecht and Hilversum; and the Recce regiment were the first to arrive with their armoured cars in Amsterdam. In the final weeks of the war the Polar Bears played a humanitarian role by bringing desperately needed food supplies to the starving population of Holland. During the campaign in North West Europe, the Polar Bears were a completely British division with units drawn from Yorkshire, Durham, Royal Scots Fusiliers, Tyneside Scottish, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Kent Yeomanry and Suffolk Hussars. In August 1944 they were joined by the South Wales Borderers, the Gloucesters and the Essex regiments. The Polar Bears suffered 11,000 casualties and earned a Victoria Cross. Following the successful formula adopted for his other divisional histories, Patrick Delaforce draws on contributions from the soldiers who fought with the Polar Bears - privates, NCOs and officers alike. In their own words they tell just what it was like as they fought through from Normandy to the relief of Holland.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PIVeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"INVENTORS","description":"Presents a timeline of inventions from the use of fire in prehistoric times to the iPad in 2010, with an emphasis on developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-twg1IqTeIIC&dq=INVENTORS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medjugorje: The Untold Story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uHLWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Medjugorje:+The+Untold+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African Ice","description":"In this brilliant new thriller from the author of \\"Lethal Dose\\" and \\"Bloodline,\\" a small team travels deep into Africa to find a hidden cache of diamonds, but will they manage to get out alive?

Siepel, is intended for the general reader. The book presents the history of the Spanish Conquest of the Americas principally through the voices of those who participated in that signal event. Its goal is to make this story engaging by substantial use of first-person narrative--much of it newly translated from Spanish and Italian sources.The overall story is told in five parts, each part featuring a principal Conquest actor--an explorer or conquistador. Volume I is devoted to the four voyages of Christopher Columbus, and to the subsequent conquest of Mexico by Hernan Cortes.Volume I opens with a scene-setting narrative and introduction to Columbus, a man with an unshakable belief in an idea and a dogged determination to carry out that idea. Columbus's landing and initial encounter with the peoples of the Americas is covered, as is his worsening relationship with the colonists, his arrest and removal to Spain, his rehabilitation, and his subsequent year-long, mutiny-ridden isolation on a Jamaican beach. Equally well covered are the many aspects of his complex personality.The second part of volume I covers the conquest of Mexico and the Aztecs by Hernan Cortes. We are taken on the early exploratory voyages to the Mexican coast, eventually to land there with Cortes and his not-totally-loyal troops. We see Cortes take charge of his men, gather initially-hostile Indian warriors to his cause, and move this large force inexorably toward the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. We witness Cortes's bold seizure of the Aztec king Montezuma, the Spaniards' flight from the capital on the noche triste, Cortes's determination to hold this land against attacking Spaniards, and his final razing of the city with the slaughter of most of its inhabitants.An effort has been made throughout Conquistador Voices to avoid moralizing on these events, but to report them--with all due filtering of wheat from chaff--as we have been told that they occurred. Nine maps accompany the text, along with index, copious footnotes, and brief bibliography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rB_LsgEACAAJ&dq=Conquistador&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not My Bowl of Rice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yIwBMAAACAAJ&dq=Not+My+Bowl+of+Rice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Having A Mary Heart in a Martha World","description":"With nearly a million copies sold, Joanna Weaver's popular book shows women how to blend intimacy with Jesus and service for Him. An invitation for every woman who feels she isn't godly enough... isn't loving enough... isn't doing enough. The life of a woman today isn't really all that different from that of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet... but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him... yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy. Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany. Tenderly he invites you to choose \\"the better part\\"-a joyful life of \\"living-room\\" intimacy with him that flows naturally into \\"kitchen service\\" for him. How can you make that choice? With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us -Marys and Marthas alike- can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy. This book includes a twelve-week Bible study. Also look for the ten-week DVD study pack companion product to this book, which includes three DVDs and a separate, revised and expanded study guide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOhe_h5_6zYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terrible Times: Book 3, The Eddie Dickens Trilogy","description":"Leaving his parents, his Mad Uncle Jack, and his Even Madder Aunt Maud at home at Awful End, Eddie Dickens, along with the color-blind Lady Constance, boards the ship the Pompous Pig on a mission to America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kWxokJPFfCsC&dq=Terrible+Times:+Book+3,+The+Eddie+Dickens+Trilogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Day for Up (Bright & Early Books(R))","description":"Rhymed text and illustrations introduce the many meanings of \\"up.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cSg_8eaKFwQC&dq=Great+Day+for+Up+(Bright&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE LIFE OF MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI.

In his latest undertaking, years in the making, Hofer has taken on nothing less than a complete and straightforward account of the Hutterite experience, an explanation of its religious basis and the source of its communal life, the life cycles from birth to death and nearly 500 years of history of this most successful of the anabaptist Christian sects, right up to present-day schisms and struggles to survive into the 21st Century. What makes \\"The Hutterites: Lives and Images of a Communal People\\" unique among books dealing with Hutterites is the author's insightful and equitable perspective on his subject. Unlike other Hutterite who have left the \\"ark of communal life, Hofer has no bones to pick, no great cause to espouse. While the book is peppered with engaging anecdotes of his Hutterite upbringing, he describes the Hutterite experience with the objectivity and dispassion worthy of a professional historian or sociologist -- but in plain language stripped of jargon and pretense. His accessibility to the Hutterite communities and to others who have left the colonies has given him a wealth of stories and examples which help to make the Hutterite experience vivid and engaging. A reader comes to know not just about the Hutterites but also what it is like to be a Hutterite. The work is studded with 140 photographs, a valuable visual record in itself. While scholars will treasure this work for both its breadth and its detail, casualobservers of Hutterite life will find it both an easy and an illuminating read. Hofer has written for the common reader who is curious about the people whose dress and language have set them apart from the multitude of other cultures, not just for professors or for other disaffected Hutterites. He pierces the myth and misconceptions that have arisen about the communal people and builds a bridge of understanding that may be crossed by anyone conscious of our common humanity. In doing so, he has created that rare book that not only informs, but serves the cause of goodness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kGTZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hutterites:+Lives+and+Images+of+a+Communal+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myths and Monsters (Secret Worlds)","description":"Contains information about the monsters found in movies, mythology, and the imagination, from dragons and sea monsters to fairies and witches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6cs-3_DoNHkC&dq=Myths+and+Monsters+(Secret+Worlds)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Willow","description":"Seven months ago, on a rainy March night, sixteen-year- old Willow's parents drank too much wine and asked her to drive them home.

Anne Moody s autobiography is an eloquent, moving testimonial to her courage.  Chicago Tribune Born to a poor couple who were tenant farmers on a plantation in Mississippi, Anne Moody lived through some of the most dangerous days of the pre-civil rights era in the South. The week before she began high school came the news of Emmet Till s lynching. Before then, she had  known the fear of hunger, hell, and the Devil. But now there was . . . the fear of being killed just because I was black.  In that moment was born the passion for freedom and justice that would change her life. A straight-A student who realized her dream of going to college when she won a basketball scholarship, she finally dared to join the NAACP in her junior year. Through the NAACP and later through CORE and SNCC, she experienced firsthand the demonstrations and sit-ins that were the mainstay of the civil rights movement and the arrests and jailings, the shotguns, fire hoses, police dogs, billy clubs, and deadly force that were used to destroy it.

Storytelling is a universal experience. From an early age, we begin to shape our own world by crafting tales. But learning to tell and write a good story isn t easy. It takes dedication and practice, just like for a musician or an athlete, and it can be just as rewarding to accomplish as winning a game or mastering an instrument. It s the kind of work that feeds our souls and makes us glad to be alive. In What s Your Story?, Newbery Medal-winning author Marion Dane Bauer discusses how to write fiction from beginning to end, including creating a story plan, choosing the best idea, bringing characters to life, deciding on a point of view, creating realistic dialogue, keeping readers hooked, and revising and polishing the finished product.  Her last comment is telling:  Knowing your craft can help you tell a story. But only by taking risks can you make art.  After many pages of provocative information and straightforward counsel, that sentence may be the one to launch youngsters to the challenge.

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER | NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Huffington Post ? Financial Times ? Success ? Inc. ? Library Journal Creativity, Inc. is a manual for anyone who strives for originality and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation into the meetings, postmortems, and  Braintrust  sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about creativity but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes,  an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.  For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, and Inside Out, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired and so profitable. As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his co-founding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie s success and in the thirteen movies that followed was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as: ? Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. ? If you don t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. ? It s not the manager s job to prevent risks. It s the manager s job to make it safe for others to take them. ? The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. ? A company s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Excursions","description":"The book deals with the combinatorial geometry of convex bodies in finite-dimensional spaces.

Recent research is discussed, for example the three problems from the combinatorial geometry of convex bodies (unsolved in the general case): the Szoekefalvi-Nagy problem, the Borsuk problem, the Hadwiger covering problem. These and related questions are then applied to a new class of convex bodies which is a natural generalization of the class of zonoids: the class of belt bodies. Finally open research problems are discussed. Each section is supplemented by a wide range of exercises and the geometric approach to many topics is illustrated with the help of more than 250 figures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0LHc-DoBHgC&dq=Excursions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","description":"An  emotion-packed  New York Timesbestselling saga by the author of Cashelmara, set on a Welsh family estate in the early twentieth century (San Francisco Chronicle).

Here is the first ever inside look at the elite NYPD squad that cracks these  unsolvable  cases. In this fascinating, in-depth narrative, Stacy Horn uses her unprecedented access to the NYPD Cold Case Squad to immerse herself into four unsolved murder cases cases going back as far as 1951 investigated by three indefatigable Cold Case detectives. Each detective uses his own contacts, informants, and resources and sifts through decades-old evidence, searching for new leads, looking for what others missed, and uncovering any possible connections. These Cold Case detectives are on a constant hunt for the needle in the haystack, and Stacy Horn puts you there every step of the way. From the grisly circumstances and desperate reconstructions of the crimes, through the endless legwork, the scientific advances that don t always yield hoped-for answers, and the harrowing politics and tangled history of the storied NYPD, Horn depicts the drama of each case, and lays out the puzzle as seen through the eyes of the detectives. At once contemplative and energetic, The Restless Sleep is a completely addictive, fly-on-the-wall story of a subculture of crime solving, and of the people who must beat the odds to offer a final resolution for the unavenged.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Msf3XZlXXo4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Watch Below","description":"\\"Five people are trapped under the sea in an experimental tanker sunk during the War.

Conventional earthquake-resistant design focuses on the strengthening of structures to avoid collapse, while little attention is paid to the prevention of damage as it is almost impossible to construct completely earthquake proof structures at reasonable cost. This state-of-the-art volume explores seismic isolation as an alternative and performance-based design approach to minimise earthquake induced loads and resulting damage in low to medium-rise buildings. A discussion of the characteristics, advantages and limitations of seismic isolation is followed by a demonstration of its capability to decouple a structure from the damaging effects of ground acceleration. Describes currently used seismic isolation systems in detail. Evaluates the performance of seismically isolated structures and provides examples of their response under earthquake action. Proposes a preliminary design methodology for seismically isolated structures. Accessible to both students and practising structural engineers who need to familiarise themselves with this approach.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VQt0QgAACAAJ&dq=Seismic+Isolation+for+Earthquake+Resistant+Structures+(Advances+in+Earthquake+Engineering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Presents Complete Book of Wedding Music for Flute or Violin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Antigone: In a New Translation (Plays for Performance Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Western Connecticut Atlas: Fairfield/New Haven/Litchfield Counties","description":"This Western Connecticut Street Atlas details Fairfield County, Litchfield County, and New Haven County.

The Cumberland army engaged the enemy across five times more territory with one-third to one-half fewer men than the Army of the Potomac, and yet its achievements in the western theater rivaled those of the larger eastern army. In Days of Glory, Larry J. Daniel brings his analytic and descriptive skills to bear on the Cumberlanders as he explores the dynamics of discord, political infighting, and feeble leadership that stymied the army in achieving its full potential. Making extensive use of thousands of letters and diaries, Daniel creates an epic portrayal of the developing Cumberland army, from untrained volunteers to hardened soldiers united in their hatred of the Confederates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GsZzRJLA9hQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Naval Strategy of the World War (Classics of Sea Power)","description":"A reprint of a classic work on German Naval strategy in WWI.

Tall, blond, and handsome, Jack was once a beloved teacher and soccer coach at a girls' prep school until a student's crush sparked a powder keg of accusation and robbed him of his reputation. Now, working for minimum wage washing dishes for Addie Peabody at the Do-Or-Diner, Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue. With ghosts of her own haunting her, Addie Peabody is as cautious around men ad Jack St. Bride is around women. But as this unassuming stranger steps smoothly into the diner's daily routine, she finds him fitting just as comfortably inside her heart - and slowly, a gentle, healing love takes hold between them. Yet planting roots in Salem Falls may prove fateful for Jack. Amid the white-painted centuries-old churches, a quartet of bored, privileged teeage girls have formed a coven that is crossing the line between amusment and malicious intent. Quick to notice the attractive new employee at Addie's diner, the girls turn Jack's world upside down with a shattering allegation that causes history to repeat itself - and forces Jack to proclaim his innocence once again. Suddenly nothing in Salem Falls is as it seems; a safe haven turns dangerous, an innocent girl meets evil face-to-face, a dishwasher with a Ph.D. is revealed to be an ex-con. As Jack's hidden past catches up with him, the seams of this tiny town begin to tear, and the emerging truth becomes a slippery concept written in shades of gray.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BquVRIOPyOUC&dq=Salem+Falls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Super Me!

By Francis Parkman)","description":"This Library of America volume, along with its companion, presents, for the first time in compact form, all seven titles of Francis Parkman s monumental account of France and England s imperial struggle for dominance on the North American continent. Deservedly compared as a literary achievement to Gibbon s The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Parkman s accomplishment is hardly less awesome than the explorations and adventures he so vividly describes. Pioneers of France in the New World (1865) begins with the early and tragic settlement of the French Huguenots in Florida, then shifts to the northern reaches of the continent and follows the expeditions of Samuel de Champlain up the St. Lawrence River and into the Great Lakes as he mapped the wilderness, organized the fur trade, promoted Christianity among the natives, and waged a savage forest campaign against the Iroquois. The Jesuits in North America in the Seventeenth Century (1867) traces the zealous efforts of the Jesuits and other Roman Catholic orders to convert the Native American tribes of North America. La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West (1869) records that explorer s voyages on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and his treks, often alone, across the vast western prairies and through the labyrinthine swamps of Louisiana. The Old R gime in Canada (1874) recounts the political struggles among the religious sects, colonial officials, feudal chiefs, royal ministers, and military commanders of Canada. Their bitter fights over the monopoly of the fur trade, the sale of brandy to the natives, the importation of wives from the orphanages and poorhouses of France, and the bizarre fanaticism of religious extremists and their  incessant supernaturalism  animate this pioneering social history of early Canada.

Created in conjunction with an exhibition of tiaras at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, this magnificent volume showcases more than 75 of the world's most exquisite tiaras adorned with everything from delicate feathers to ornately decorated, gold fleur-di-lis scrollwork set in diamonds, pearls, and sapphires.

(John Smyth Mystery Series #1)","description":"This set includes all three books of the John Smyth Mysteries series: Who's Grace?, Desolation Highway, and Mountaintop Drive. In Who's Grace?, James Coggins presents a fast-paced murder mystery with a twist. A Christian magazine editor named John Smyth witnesses a murder through the window of an airplane as it descends for a landing in Winnipeg, Canada. Neither the city police nor the RCMP (Mounties) take his tip seriously until an unidentified woman's body turns up in some nearby woods two weeks later. The only clue to her identity is a necklace with a pendant bearing the name 'Grace.' Who is she, and where is her killer? As the case twists and turns, everyone involved gets to see clear evidence of the grace of God. In Desolation Highway, two bodies are found in the forest near the Yellowhead Highway in northern British Columbia, prompting Sergeant Wesson and other members of the local detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to begin searching for a serial murderer. Suspects include a woodsman who makes wildlife sculptures using a chainsaw, an antisocial doctor, a strange woman engaged in occult practices, and a group of Native youth addicted to gasoline sniffing. As more dismembered bodies turn up, John Smyth, editor of Grace magazine in Winnipeg, visits the area and starts putting pieces of the puzzle together. In Mountaintop Drive, it is just like a second honeymoon when diminutive editor John Smyth and his wife, Ruby, are invited to stay in a beautiful mountaintop house while attending a church convention in Canada's \\"Bible Belt.\\" Everything seems perfect--until the woman next door is murdered. Has trouble from the impoverished streets of old Abbotsford invaded the upscale community of Mountaintop Drive?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SVMR1A_qGSAC&dq=Who%27s+Grace%3F+(John+Smyth+Mystery+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estimation of the Time Since Death in the Early Postmortem Period","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nelly's Silver Mine: A Story of Colorado Life","description":"A New England preacher suffering from asthma moves his family to Colorado.

Just may be the best new comedy of [the year] . . . based on restaurateur Eddie Huang s memoir of the same name . . . [a] classic fresh-out-of-water comedy.  People  Bawdy and frequently hilarious . . . a surprisingly sophisticated memoir about race and assimilation in America . . . as much James Baldwin and Jay-Z as Amy Tan . . . rowdy [and] vital . . . It s a book about fitting in by not fitting in at all.  Dwight Garner, The New York Times NATIONAL BESTSELLER ? NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY KIRKUS REVIEWS Assimilating ain t easy. Eddie Huang was raised by a wild family of FOB ( fresh off the boat ) immigrants his father a cocksure restaurateur with a dark past back in Taiwan, his mother a fierce protector and constant threat. Young Eddie tried his hand at everything mainstream America threw his way, from white Jesus to macaroni and cheese, but finally found his home as leader of a rainbow coalition of lost boys up to no good: skate punks, dealers, hip-hop junkies, and sneaker freaks. This is the story of a Chinese-American kid in a could-be-anywhere cul-de-sac blazing his way through America s deviant subcultures, trying to find himself, ten thousand miles from his legacy and anchored only by his conflicted love for his family and his passion for food. Funny, moving, and stylistically inventive, Fresh Off the Boat is more than a radical reimagining of the immigrant memoir it s the exhilarating story of every American outsider who finds his destiny in the margins. Praise for Fresh Off the Boat  Brash and funny . . . outrageous, courageous, moving, ironic and true.  New York Times Book Review  Mercilessly funny and provocative, Fresh Off the Boat is also a serious piece of work. Eddie Huang is hunting nothing less than Big Game here. He does everything with style.  Anthony Bourdain  Uproariously funny . . . emotionally honest.  Chicago Tribune  Huang is a fearless raconteur. [His] writing is at once hilarious and provocative; his incisive wit pulls through like a perfect plate of dan dan noodles.  Interview  Although writing a memoir is an audacious act for a thirty-year-old, it is not nearly as audacious as some of the things Huang did and survived even earlier. . . . Whatever he ends up doing, you can be sure it won t look or sound like anything that s come before. A single, kinetic passage from Fresh Off the Boat . . . is all you need to get that straight.

Piers Anthony s Shame of Man is a towering saga of remarkable scope, retelling the story of humanity in a daring and exciting way. At once grand in scope and intimate in human detail, Shame of Man recounts the stunning journey of a single family reborn again and again throughout history. Beginning in the earliest origins of our ancient ancestors who emerged from the Eden of Africa millions of years ago, Shame of Man follows two lovers Hugh, a dreamer and musician, and his beloved Ann, a beautiful dancer as they struggle to preserve their family and their way of life during some of the most turbulent periods of our savage past. Their saga takes them from the caves of prehistoric Europe to the Holy Land in the time of King David, through the imperial court of third century Japan, and Damascus in the early days of Islam, to Central Asia in the era of Genghis Khan, and the fallen paradise of Easter Island, concluding with a harrowing glimpse of our future, in the wreckage of a world devastated by global ecological catastrophe.

This universal truth unites three bodies of thought--economics, evolution, and history--that have developed largely in mutual isolation. Here, Geerat Vermeij undertakes a groundbreaking and provocative exploration of the facts and theories of biology, economics, and geology to show how processes common to all economic systems--competition, cooperation, adaptation, and feedback--govern evolution as surely as they do the human economy, and how historical patterns in both human and nonhuman evolution follow from this principle. Using a wealth of examples of evolutionary innovations, Vermeij argues that evolution and economics are one. Powerful consumers and producers exercise disproportionate controls on the characteristics, activities, and distribution of all life forms. Competition-driven demand by consumers, when coupled with supply-side conditions permitting economic growth, leads to adaptation and escalation among organisms. Although disruptions in production halt or reverse these processes temporarily, they amplify escalation in the long run to produce trends in all economic systems toward greater power, higher production rates, and a wider reach for economic systems and their strongest members. Despite our unprecedented power to shape our surroundings, we humans are subject to all the economic principles and historical trends that emerged at life's origin more than 3 billion years ago. Engagingly written, brilliantly argued, and sweeping in scope, Nature: An Economic History shows that the human institutions most likely to preserve opportunity and adaptability are, after all, built like successful living things.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H9RFCa7rH8QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biological Psychology (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Growing Up With \\"Shoeless Joe\\" The Greatest Natural Player in Baseball History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wACeAAAACAAJ&dq=Growing+Up+With+%22Shoeless+Joe%22+The+Greatest+Natural+Player+in+Baseball+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Unofficial Guide to the Best RV & Tent Campgrounds in the U.S.A.","description":"Covers campgrounds in every state except Hawaii One out of every ten vehicle-owning households in the U.S. owns an RV, and 150 million Americans enjoy camping Reviews nearly 5,000 campgrounds that accommodate RVers and families traveling by car Includes \\"Campground Awards\\" for privacy, cleanliness, security, facilities, and best setting Formerly titled The Unofficial Guide to the Best RV and Tent Campgrounds in the U.S.A.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bcq5wAEACAAJ&dq=Frommer%27s+Unofficial+Guide+to+the+Best+RV&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Venetian painters of the renaissance,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KZ9svf4p3MoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bigwig Briefs: Become an Investment Banker - The Real World Intelligence Necessary to Become a Successful Investment Banker","description":"Provides articles by leading investment bankers from such firms as Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank on how to become successful and rise to the top of the profession.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MMdAQAAMAAJ&dq=Bigwig+Briefs:+Become+an+Investment+Banker+-+The+Real+World+Intelligence+Necessary+to+Become+a+Successful+Investment+Banker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boy Next Door Signed","description":"To: You (you) From: Human Resources (human.resources@thenyjournal.com) Subject: This Book Dear Reader, This is an automated message from the Human Resources Division of the New York Journal, New York City s leading photo-newspaper.

They have been on tour since September, but hopes of a West End transfer have been abandoned and they are all looking forward to the end of the run the following Saturday. Flood is visited that night by his estranged wife, Jenny, now living with wealthy entrepreneur Roger Colborn. Jenny runs a shop in the Lanes and is worried about a strange man who is hanging around outside. Roger has dismissed her concerns but Jenny persuades Toby, for old times  sake, to do something. The next day Flood trails the man and confronts him. Derek Oswin is an unemployed loner who blames Roger Colborn for his father s death from cancer on account of dangerous practices at the now-closed plastics factory run by Roger and his late father, Sir Walter Colborn. However, Oswin is a fan of Flood s and eventually he agrees to lay off. Then, Colborn gets wind of Flood s contact with Jenny and tries to buy him off, but Flood sees only a longed-for opportunity to win Jenny back, and presses for answers to a host of questions surrounding the death of Sir Walter seven years earlier. Before he fully understands the risks he is running, Flood finds himself entangled in the mysterious -- and dangerous -- relationship between the Oswins and the Colborns.

However, our current understanding of what such systems would be like is insufficient to bring the promise to reality. Embedded, Everywhere explores the potential of networked systems of embedded computers and the research challenges arising from embedding computation and communications technology into a wide variety of applicationsa\\"from precision agriculture to automotive telematics to defense systems. It describes how these emerging networks operate under unique constraints not present in more traditional distributed systems, such as the Internet.

Douglas in an historic argument over the future of slavery in a westward-expanding America. Two years later, an equally historic oratorical showdown between secessionists and Unionists in Georgia generated as much popular interest south of the Mason-Dixon line, and perhaps had an even more profound immediate effect on the future of the United States. With Abraham Lincoln's \\"Black Republican\\" triumph in the presidential election of 1860 came ardent secessionist sentiment in the South. But Unionists were equally zealous and while South Carolina--a bastion of Disunionism since 1832--seemed certain to secede; the other fourteen slave states were far from decided. In the deep South, the road to disunion depended much on the actions of Georgia, a veritable microcosm of the divided South and geographically in the middle of the Cotton South. If Georgia went for the Union, secessionist South Carolina could be isolated. So in November of 1860 all the eyes of Dixie turned to tiny Milledgeville, pre-war capital of Georgia, for a legislative confrontation that would help chart the course toward civil war. In Secession Debated, William W. Freehling and Craig M. Simpson have for the first time collected the seven surviving speeches and public letters of this greatest of southern debates over disunion, providing today's reader with a unique window into a moment of American crisis. Introducing the debate and debaters in compelling fashion, the editors help bring to life a sleepy Southern town suddenly alive with importance as a divided legislature met to decide the fate of Georgia, and by extension, that of the nation. We hear myriad voices, among them the energetic and self-righteous governor Joseph E. Brown who, while a slaveholder and secessionist, was somewhat suspect as a native North Georgian; Alexander H. Stephens, the eloquent Unionist whose \\"calm dispassionate approach\\" ultimately backfired; and fiery secessionist Robert Toombs who, impatient with Brown's indecisiveness and the caution of the Unionists, shouted to legislators: \\"Give me the sword! but if you do not place it in my hands, before God! I will take it.\\" The secessionists' Henry Benning and Thomas R.R. Cobb as well as the Unionists Benjamin Hill and Herschel Johnson also speak to us across the years, most with eloquence, all with the patriotic, passionate conviction that defined an era. In the end, the legislature adopted a convention bill which decreed a popular vote on the issue in early January, 1861. The election results were close, mirroring the intense debate of two months before: 51% of Georgians favored immediate secession, a slim margin which the propaganda-conscious Brown later inflated to 58%. On January 19th the Georgia Convention sanctioned secession in a 166-130 vote, and the imminent Confederacy had its Southern hinge. Secession Debated is a colorful and gripping tale told in the words of the actual participants, one which sheds new light on one of the great and hitherto neglected verbal showdowns in American history. It is essential to a full understanding of the origins of the war between the states.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1xKD6b-w1JMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learnables Hebrew Level 1 Listening Book & CD","description":"\\"Reviews, goal setting, what to teach, learning styles, how to teach, planning and record keeping, resource addresses\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7PUx_XpLclcC&dq=Learnables+Hebrew+Level+1+Listening+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success Secrets of Super Achievers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gTPVvQm747AC&dq=Success+Secrets+of+Super+Achievers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indian Two Feet and his horse: El indio Dos Pies y su caballo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7lOMwEACAAJ&dq=Indian+Two+Feet+and+his+horse:+El+indio+Dos+Pies+y+su+caballo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tuff's Luck (Puppy Patrol)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Necessary Fictions","description":"From the author of Welcome to Camp America, an eerie exploration of America's performance of power and identity in the post-9/11 era What are the stories we tell ourselves, the games we play, to manage unsettling realities?

Fans of the chart-topping comics could turn to the cards for further insight into their favorite characters, as Marvel writers and editors included bios, stats, and trivia for each hero and villain. The Uncanny X-Men Trading Cards: The Complete Series collects, for the first time, the front and back of each collectible card in the set--including Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Magneto, and Deadpool--along with select scans of Lee's original and digitally remastered art. It also includes an introduction by and original interviews conducted by writer and set editor Bob Budiansky, with the Marvel staff who helped assemble, design, and create these iconic trading cards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N9qzzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Uncanny+X-Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Cup Overflows","description":"Delois Ford Perry was born in Conway, Arkansas where she lived until she graduated from Pine Street High School.

Stanley Jones","description":"2007 John Pollock Award for Christian Biography (Beeson Divinity School, Samford University) For more than half a century, E. Stanley Jones (1884-1973) was arguably the most widely known and universally admired Christian missionary and evangelist of the twentieth century. He went to India as a missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1907 and later became an itinerant evangelist. Equally concerned for social justice and spirituality, Jones supported Indian aspirations for independence, and was sensitive to Indian religious traditions. He founded two Christian ashrams (religious retreats) in India, one at Sat Tal and the other in Lucknow (where he also founded a psychiatric center). He wrote nearly thirty books, most notably The Christ of the Indian Road (1925). This is a paperback book with a photo section. Dr. Graham has written a chronological account of the life and ministry of E. Stanley Jones's life for a broad audience. Jones's life is set in the context of the historical, political, and religious events of his day. In particular, Jones's life and ministry will be set against the backdrop of the Christian missionary movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; the aftermath of WWI; the different phases of the Indian independence movement; the origins of Japanese imperialism and militarism in the Pacific during the 1930s and 1940s; and finally, American domestic and international politics following WWII.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=otI8AAAACAAJ&dq=Ordinary+Man,+Extraordinary+Mission:+The+Life+and+Work+of+E.+Stanley+Jones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative International Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Thing: Project Pegasus Saga","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M_kfAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Thing:+Project+Pegasus+Saga&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life of a Jamaican Girl","description":"From the simple paradise of mango and guava trees in the tropics of Jamaica to the fast-moving, unfamiliar streets of New York, Sandra's life took a change that she couldn't control. When she and her brother Kevin were swept away from their grandmother's rural home by a father that had been absent for as many years as they could remember, it was supposed to be for the best. However, an abusive stepmother and a stepbrother with hands that wandered made Sandra's life a living hell. Forced to find ways to dodge the bullets of the life she'd come to know, Sandra constantly struggled with the crushing blows of a shattered self-esteem, and a father who hid so far in a bottle of booze that he was indifferent to his own flesh and blood. Deep in the pit of depression, Sandra sought the ultimate out, suicide. In the hospital, Sandra learned that the prison she'd desperately tried to break free of followed her. Her own guilt of her circumstances and the resulting self-loathing had become worse than any bars could have ever been. Prescribing more than medicine, Dr. Russo gave Sandra a healthy dose of something she hadn't had since those long ago days in Jamaica, care and concern. With new scenery, and a determination to take control of her life, Sandra learned that living with others required trust and compromise. She also learned that the people who cared the most were the ones who were patient enough to allow her to find herself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wc85AAAACAAJ&dq=Life+of+a+Jamaican+Girl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meaning and Necessity: A Study in Semantics and Modal Logic","description":"\\"This book is valuable as expounding in full a theory of meaning that has its roots in the work of Frege and has been of the widest influence. . . .

The riveting inside story of Elon Musk and Tesla's bid to build the world's greatest car from award-winning Wall Street Journal tech and auto reporter Tim Higgins.  A deeply reported and business-savvy chronicle of Tesla's wild ride.   Walter Isaacson, New York Times Book Review Tesla is the envy of the automotive world. Born at the start of the millennium, it was the first car company to be valued at $1 trillion. Its CEO, the mercurial, charismatic Elon Musk has become not just a celebrity but the richest man in the world. But Tesla s success was far from guaranteed. Founded in the 2000s, the company was built on an audacious vision. Musk and a small band of Silicon Valley engineers set out to make a car that was quicker, sexier, smoother, and cleaner than any gas-guzzler on the road. Tesla would undergo a hellish fifteen years, beset by rivals pressured by investors, hobbled by whistleblowers. Musk often found himself in the public s crosshairs, threatening to bring down the company he had helped build. Wall Street Journal tech and auto reporter Tim Higgins had a front-row seat for the drama: the pileups, breakdowns, and the unlikeliest outcome of all, success. A story of impossible wagers and unlikely triumphs, Power Play is an exhilarating look at how a team of innovators beat the odds and changed the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQEHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fate of a Gesture: Jackson Pollock and Postwar American Art","description":"I am indebted first to Thomas B.

The storyteller is Big Jim Wilson, All-American football player and survivor of seven years in the NFL, who was promised wealth and the world championship as pro wrestler. Instead, Jim Wilson found a surprisingly lucrative sports entertainment industry built on a pyramid of secrets that included abusive control of its performers and a long history of illegal business practices and corruption of politicians and state athletic commissions. Chokehold describes and documents the abuses that Jim Wilson witnessed and endured blacklisting, strong-arm tactics, homosexual blackmail, defiance of the U.S. Justice Department and bribery of TV executives and arena managers. Chokehold is an explosive indictment of the pro wrestling industrys business practices as well as a thoughtful proposal for pro wrestlings reform. This book is not a conventional expos of pro wrestlings orchestrated stunts, gimmicks and blade jobs. Instead, it is an unprecedented examination of pro wrestlings less visible cons outside the ring -- its hidden manipulation of wrestlers with broken promises and broken bones and a backstage power of the pencil that writes scripts for wrestler stardom or extinction. Chokehold describes a secret slice of the wrestling life where traveling troupes of heels and babyfaces understand how they got into the game, but cannot find a way up or out. This is the story of why and how the big guys almost always lose. Chokehold is part autobiography and part pro wrestling history. Written in wrestlespeak (the industrys insider argot), it is dedicated to the memory of the older boys whose broken bodies and shattered lives should have taught us something. In addition to Jim Wilsons experiences in The Business, this book reviews significant but forgotten episodes in the wrestling industrys long history of gangland tactics. The industrys infamous blacklist is revisited by revealing the dozens of wrestlers from the past whose names were on it. The industrys history of predatory promotional wars in California, Georgia, Texas and Virginia is told with FBI reports obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. From court documents, this book names compromised state athletic commissions, TV station managers and local politicians from wrestlings viewpoint, the best that money could buy. There are many famous wrestling names in this book --Gorgeous George, Lou Thesz, Jack Brisco, the Funk brothers, Dusty Rhodes, Bruiser Brody, Bill Watts and others. Another is The Sheik (Eddie Farhat), who says: There aint no nice guys in this business. There aint no people theres dollars! Another is Jim Wilsons tag team partner Thunderbolt Patterson who warned Jim, The wrestling business takes advantage of anybody who has any notoriety or ability. You got to understand that wrestlers are worse than whores. They are pimped. They use you as long as they possibly can or as long as you dont complain. When you complain, they get rid of you. Another is Jim Wilsons friend The Magnificent Zulu (Ron Pope) who summarizes his career this way: Its such a crooked business. The guys [wrestlers] are a bunch of crooks. They steal from the marks and the promoters steal from them. The guys [wrestlers] want to be stars! Theyll do anything theyll cut throats for it. Actually, wrestlers dont have to be paid. All they need is a couple of six packs of beer a night and a nice looking ring rat with a good body. Or, drugs and a ring rat. Its not the money. Its being a star! Its the glory and the pussy! This book confronts the wrestling industrys traditional practice of punishing wrestlers who refuse","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=epCYZj7Li-AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The book of Monelle,: By Marcel Schwob; translated by William Brown Meloney v; with preface by John Erskine and an introduction by the translator","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HG80AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+book+of+Monelle,:+By+Marcel+Schwob%3B+translated+by+William+Brown+Meloney+v%3B+with+preface+by+John+Erskine+and+an+introduction+by+the+translator&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gleanings from Paul: Studies in the Prayers of the Apostle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"First Latin lessons (The Lake classical series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Year: Astrology, Millenarianism, and History in the Western Tradition (Arkana)","description":"Acorns delineates the future of humanity as a reunification of intellect with the Deep Self.

In Knowing When to Stop, one of the most creative American artists of our time offers readers a colorful narrative of his first twenty-seven years, expertly unraveling the intriguing conundrum of who he truly is and how he came to be that way. As the author himself writes,  A memoir is not a diary. Diaries are written in the heat of battle, memoirs in the repose of retrospect.  But careful thought and consideration have not dulled the sharp point of Rorem s pen as he writes openly of his life and loves, his missteps and triumphs, and offers frank and fascinating portraits of the luminaries in his circle: Aaron Copland, Truman Capote, Jean Cocteau, Martha Graham, Igor Stravinsky, Billie Holliday, Paul Bowles, and Alfred C. Kinsey, to name a few. The result is an early life story that is riveting, moving, and intimate a magnificent self-portrait of one of the great minds of this age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3VHLC1SLzkcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Protrait of the Artist as a Young Man","description":"\\"James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) is one of the twentieth century's great coming-of-age novels.

Over the next decade he, like other German Jews, lost his job, his house and many of his friends. Klemperer remained loyal to his country, determined not to emigrate, and convinced that each successive Nazi act against the Jews must be the last. Saved for much of the war from the Holocaust by his marriage to a gentile, he was able to escape in the aftermath of the Allied bombing of Dresden and survived the remaining months of the war in hiding. Throughout, Klemperer kept a diary. Shocking and moving by turns, it is a remarkable and important account.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J2YLzgEACAAJ&dq=I+shall+bear+witness+:+the+diaries+of+Victor+Klemperer,+1933-41&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese Tanka: The Court Poetry of a Golden Age","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5NqINwAACAAJ&dq=Japanese+Tanka:+The+Court+Poetry+of+a+Golden+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"German Women for Empire, 1884 1945 (Politics, History, and Culture)","description":"When Germany annexed colonies in Africa and the Pacific beginning in the 1880s, many German women were enthusiastic. At the same time, however, they found themselves excluded from what they saw as a great nationalistic endeavor. In German Women for Empire, 18841945 Lora Wildenthal untangles the varied strands of racism, feminism, and nationalism that thread through German women s efforts to participate in this episode of overseas colonization. In confrontation and sometimes cooperation with men over their place in the colonial project, German women launched nationalist and colonialist campaigns for increased settlement and new state policies. Wildenthal analyzes recently accessible Colonial Office archives as well as mission society records, periodicals, women s memoirs, and fiction to show how these women created niches for themselves in the colonies. They emphasized their unique importance for white racial  purity  and the inculcation of German culture in the family. While pressing for career opportunities for themselves, these women also campaigned against interracial marriage and circulated an image of African and Pacific women as sexually promiscuous and inferior. As Wildenthal discusses, the German colonial imaginary persisted even after the German colonial empire was no longer a reality. The women s colonial movement continued into the Nazi era, combining with other movements to help turn the racialist thought of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries into the hierarchical evaluation of German citizens as well as colonial subjects. Students and scholars of women s history, modern German history, colonial politics and culture, postcolonial theory, race/ethnicity, and gender will welcome this groundbreaking study.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WK7wTLVneYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deep Black (Deep Black Series)","description":"In Stephen Coonts' Deep Black, cowritten with Jim DeFelice, a spy plane gathering data on a new Russian weapon is blown out of the sky by a mysterious MiG.

For most, menopause occurs around around age 50. Those women are lucky, because they can access the plethora of books that will help guide them through every phase of menopause. But for at least 1 in 100 women, menopause can occur as early as age 35, sometimes younger. And thousands more women will experience premature ovarian failure due to other medical conditions and treatments, such as cancer treatment. Whatever the cause of early menopause, women going through it are left in a vacuum, where finding a healthcare practitioner experienced enough to treat them is difficult, let alone finding suitable information. Until now. With Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure, Karin Banerd adds an important voice to menopause literature, addressing the distinct needs of the woman in premature menopause, as they are quite different from those of natural menopause. Banerd's personal experience and knowledge of premature menopause offers a unique perspective, as she shares her intimate, treacherous and painful journey that started at age 35. In the book, Banerd describes the warning signs of hormonal decline and the havoc these unexpected changes wreaked on her life. She also highlights the unique context of premature menopause, how it necessitates a different set of responses from doctors, and what she feels those responses should be. She goes on to explain exactly what premature menopause is and how it differs from natural menopause. And finally, she details various strategies for maintaining optimum health during the menopausal years. The last section, in particular, demonstrates how premature menopause can be a wake-up call for making nutritional and lifestyle choices that have far-reaching effects into the senior years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G8LPHYWaEUQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack Russell Terriers: Everything About Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Behavior, and Training (Complete Pet Owner's Manual)","description":"Everything you want to know about adoption, purchase, care, nutrition, behavior, and training.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3ZgWAAAACAAJ&dq=Jack+Russell+Terriers:+Everything+About+Purchase,+Care,+Nutrition,+Behavior,+and+Training+(Complete+Pet+Owner%27s+Manual)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of World Military Aircraft.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I, and the space race was born. Desperate to beat the Russians into space, NASA put together a crew of the nation s most daring test pilots: the seven men who were to lead America to the moon. The first into space was Alan Shepard; the last was Deke Slayton, whose irregular heartbeat kept him grounded until 1975. They spent the 1960s at the forefront of NASA s effort to conquer space, and Moon Shot is their inside account of what many call the twentieth century s greatest feat landing humans on another world. Collaborating with NBC s veteran space reporter Jay Barbree, Shepard and Slayton narrate in gripping detail the story of America s space exploration from the time of Shepard s first flight until he and eleven others had walked on the moon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CIj9b6O4ygcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seth Material","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oVHWAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Seth+Material&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transform Your Life (Revised and Expanded to Include \\"How to Have a Flood and Not Drown\\")","description":"Offers a positive, inspirational message of love, faith, and prosperity, with a personal plan for transforming one's life through the power of prayer and leading a more spiritual life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1H30OF3VWZoC&dq=Transform+Your+Life+(Revised+and+Expanded+to+Include+%22How+to+Have+a+Flood+and+Not+Drown%22)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Money Game-how it is played on Wall street","description":"An expose on the delusion, greed, and arrogance that led to America's credit crisis The collapse of America's credit markets in 2008 is quite possibly the biggest financial disaster in U.S. history.

In this book Ludlow uses the metaphysics of time as a case study and focuses on the dispute between A-theorists and B-theorists about the nature of time. According to B-theorists, there is no genuine change, but a permanent sequence of events ordered by an earlier-than/later-than relation. According to the version of the A-theory adopted by Ludlow (a position sometimes called \\"presentism\\"), there are no past or future events or times; what makes something past or future is how the world stands right now. Ludlow argues that each metaphysical picture is tied to a particular semantical theory of tense and that the dispute can be adjudicated on semantical grounds. A presentism-compatible semantics, he claims, is superior to a B-theory semantics in a number of respects, including its abilities to handle the indexical nature of temporal discourse and to account for facts about language acquisition. Along the way, Ludlow develops a conception of \\"E-type\\" temporal anaphora that can account for both temporal anaphora and complex tenses without reference to past and future events. His view has philosophical consequences for theories of logic, self-knowledge, and memory. As for linguistic consequences, Ludlow suggests that the very idea of grammatical tense may have to be dispensed with and replaced with some combination of aspect, modality, and evidentiality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8wZtjkL1l28C&dq=Semantics,+Tense,+and+Time:+An+Essay+in+the+Metaphysics+of+Natural+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Much Is That Couple In The Window?

This book analyses the ways in which sex and sexuality have been discussed in The People's Republic of China since 1949. It examines a wide range of materials - the official and popular press, women's magazines, sex education publications, self-help guides and medical advice pamphlets - and compares and contrasts the various discourses of sexuality and the meanings associated with 'woman' that emerge from them. It considers the role of the state in matters of sexuality, and argues that women's sexuality has been consistently targeted as a site for the regulation of general standards of sexual and social conduct. This is a highly original contribution to the growing body of literature on women and gender in China. It will appeal to students and scholars of modern and contemporary China, and to all those engaged in current debates about sexuality and gender in international feminist scholarship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SblpQgAACAAJ&dq=Women+and+Sexuality+in+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemical Engineering Design, Fourth Edition: Chemical Engineering Volume 6 (Coulson & Richardson's Chemical Engineering)","description":"Chemical Engineering Design is one of the best-known and widely adopted texts available for students of chemical engineering.

This symbolism encouraged the aeronautical community to focus research and development on metal airplanes at the expense of promising projects involving wood - despite the fact that other countries continued to produce highly successful aircraft with wood through the end of World War II. According to Schatzberg, technical personnel in the American military played the key role in this process. They had little evidence for metal's superiority but used their dominant influence to press the case that metal was the wave of the future and that airplanes would inevitably follow ships and abandon wood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6BEoAQAAMAAJ&dq=Wings+of+Wood,+Wings+of+Metal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Homosexualization of America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Sticker Dictionary","description":"Scholastic Early Learners: Encourage early literacy with My Sticker Dictionary, an interactive project book that introduces kids to over 250 first words!

It is a mantra, a duty, a way of life in a tightly monitored world where thinking is dangerous and books are forbidden. In 1953, Ray Bradbury envisioned one of the world's most unforgettable dystopian futures, and in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the artist Tim Hamilton translates this frightening modern masterpiece into a gorgeously imagined graphic novel. As could only occur with Bradbury's full cooperation in this authorized adaptation, Hamilton has created a striking work of art that uniquely captures Montag's awakening to the evil of government-controlled thought and the inestimable value of philosophy, theology, and literature. Including an original foreword by Ray Bradbury and fully depicting the brilliance and force of his canonic and beloved masterwork, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is an exceptional, haunting work of graphic literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HXeODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sears Roebuck Catalogue: 1927 Edition","description":"Reproduction of the 1927 Sears catalogue illuminates the fashions, furnishings, and fads of this prosperous period","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3FgrAQAACAAJ&dq=Sears+Roebuck+Catalogue:+1927+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","description":"John C.

A Novel.","description":"Acclaimed National Book Award-winning author George Packer diagnoses America's descent into a failed state, and envisions a path toward overcoming injustices, paralyses, and divides How, in a few decades, did the United States transform from a broadly prosperous middle-class country, with relatively healthy institutions and competent leaders, to a nation defined by discredited elites, hollowed-out institutions, and blatant inequalities-feared and pitied by our friends, mocked and sabotaged by our adversaries, first in the world in Covid cases and deaths, and led in recent years by an incompetent authoritarian bigot? Last Best Hope is a bracing account of our current crisis and of how a new era of civic revitalization may bring it to an end. Combining reportage with historical narrative, autobiography, and political analysis, Packer depicts and assesses the four inadequate narratives that dominate American public life: Libertarian America, which imagines a nation of individuals responsible for their own fate, and serves the interests of corporations and the wealthy; Cosmopolitan America, the ideology of Silicon Valley and the professional elite,which celebrates globalization and leaves many American communities behind; Diverse America, which defines citizens as members of large identity groups that have inflicted or suffered oppression; and White America, a shallow nationalism that fears the contamination of non-whites and treachery of coastal elites, and poses the greatest threat to democracy in our lifetime. At a time when many fear that the American experiment in self-government may collapse, or, in Abraham Lincoln's words, \\"die by suicide\\", Packer shows that none of these narratives can sustain American democracy. To point a better way forward, he looks back at previous eras of crisis to discover the resources for invigorating self-government. Combining trenchant social analysis with a vibrant and stinging essayistic voice and a deep knowledge of America's past and present, Last Best Hope is an essential contribution to the literature of national self-examination the times demand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zqYAEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+LAST+BEST+HOPE.+A+Novel.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","description":"Since 1973, TEXAS MONTHLY has chronicled life in contemporary Texas, reporting on vital issues such as politics, the environment, industry, and education.

Protestants deny it even exists, while many Catholics fundamentally misunderstand it. It is Purgatory: that place of purifying penance where souls saved by Christ are made perfect and acceptable to spend life eternal in heaven. In The Biblical Basis For Purgatory, author and apologist John Salza (Why Catholics Cannot Be Masons) offers the definitive scriptural explanation of this distinctively Catholic doctrine. Building on the teachings of Christ and St. Paul, he shows how the existence of a place of temporal punishment after death is not only a logical extension of what we know about the reality of sin and God's justice, but is also a supreme expression of God's love and mercy. Although Purgatory is a place of mercy, its pains are real, and they are severe. This book does more than defend and explain Purgatory it provides a solid plan, drawn from the Church's perennial wisdom for conquering our sins by God's grace, while still on earth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4eG7CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","description":"Mikhail Tal, the 'magician from Riga, ' was the greatest attacking World Champion of them all, and this enchanting autobiography chronicles his extraordinary career with charm and humor.

We reach a hand out. In the 2.1 seconds that this impulse travels through our brain, billions of neurons communicate with one another, sending blips of voltage through our sensory and motor regions. Neuroscientists call these blips  spikes.  Spikes enable us to do everything: talk, eat, run, see, plan, and decide. In The Spike, Mark Humphries takes readers on the epic journey of a spike through a single, brief reaction. In vivid language, Humphries tells the story of what happens in our brain, what we know about spikes, and what we still have left to understand about them. Drawing on decades of research in neuroscience, Humphries explores how spikes are born, how they are transmitted, and how they lead us to action. He dives into previously unanswered mysteries: Why are most neurons silent? What causes neurons to fire spikes spontaneously, without input from other neurons or the outside world? Why do most spikes fail to reach any destination? Humphries presents a new vision of the brain, one where fundamental computations are carried out by spontaneous spikes that predict what will happen in the world, helping us to perceive, decide, and react quickly enough for our survival. Traversing neuroscience s expansive terrain, The Spike follows a single electrical response to illuminate how our extraordinary brains work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1f36DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Women: An Anthology of Readings on Women in Western Culture, Volume 2 (Renaissance to the Present)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RERLAQAAMAAJ&dq=Creating+Women:+An+Anthology+of+Readings+on+Women+in+Western+Culture,+Volume+2+(Renaissance+to+the+Present)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fourth Of Forever (Harlequin Historical)","description":"Marcus Quicksilver Moved Like A Mountain Lion On The Prowl And if Amanda Grenville had any sense, she'd be putting miles of prairie between them, instead of running straight into his arms.

A consummate professional? A bright star in the Hollywood universe? Yes, you could say all those things. Or you could just say that he was the little dog that could. The little dog that never took no for an answer. The little dog that never said, \\"I can't,\\" but always, \\"why can't I?\\" The story of Moose is a classic rags-to-riches story of how an average pound-bound puppy barked, jumped, and mugged his way up the ladder of success to become a major superstar. Not since Lassie has America cared so much about one of its four-legged creatures. At least, that's what Moose would say. I would say that working with that dog has been a nightmare. I had to be at his beck and call, any time, day or night. You don't know what it's like to get a call at three o'clock in the morning because \\"someone\\" has something he wants to add to the Frasier chapter. Did he think I had no life of my own? Or that I slept by the telephone waiting for him to call? Yes, he did. Because, like most uber-stars, he thought the world revolved around him. From the moment I committed to working with him on this book, it's been nothing but Moose, Moose, Moose. But I have to admit he's had a fascinating life. To be plucked out of obscurity and thrust into the limelight may be the dream of every actor in the world, but in reality it's more of a challenge than most people realize. It's hard not toget caught up in all the glitter and hype of Hollywood and completelylose sight of what's really important--family and friends. As egomaniacal as Moose is, he has never forgotten where he came from or taken for granted the fans that got him where he is today. He's a complex guy--selfish and independent, demanding and feisty, impatient and intense, arrogant and stubborn, and strong-willed. But heis also loving, caring, thoughtful when he wants to be, charismatic, funny, charming, and above all loyal. In short, Moose is a Jack Russell terrier with an attitude.

Just listen to the everyday talk that emerges in public spaces, suggests Melissa Harris-Lacewell. And listen this author has--to black college students talking about the Million Man March and welfare, to Southern, black Baptists discussing homosexuality in the church, to black men in a barbershop early on a Saturday morning, to the voices of hip-hop music and Black Entertainment Television. Using statistical, experimental, and ethnographic methods Barbershops, Bibles, and B.E.T offers a new perspective on the way public opinion and ideologies are formed at the grassroots level. The book makes an important contribution to our understanding of black politics by shifting the focus from the influence of national elites in opinion formation to the influence of local elites and people in daily interaction with each other. Arguing that African Americans use community dialogue to jointly develop understandings of their collective political interests, Harris-Lacewell identifies four political ideologies that constitute the framework of contemporary black political thought: Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, Black Conservatism and Liberal Integrationism. These ideologies, the book posits, help African Americans to understand persistent social and economic inequality, to identify the significance of race in that inequality, and to devise strategies for overcoming it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M9Iu6oSm9NEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clymer Suzuki: Gsx-R750 1988-1992 & Gsx750F Katana 1988-1996 (Clymer Motorcycle Repair)","description":"GSX-R750 (1988-1992), GSX750F Katana (1989-1996)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0fwwAEACAAJ&dq=Clymer+Suzuki:+Gsx-R750+1988-1992&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bringing Mysteries Alive for Children and Young Adults","description":"Presents an introduction to the mystery genre, discussing why children and young adults might or might not enjoy mysteries, looking at series mysteries, offering suggestions for educators on how to integrate mysteries into other areas of the curriculum, and including outlines for mystery-related programs, as well as lists of mystery books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T4hYAAAAYAAJ&dq=Bringing+Mysteries+Alive+for+Children+and+Young+Adults&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technoculture (Studies in Classical Philology)","description":"Case studies of groups including high-tech office workers, Star trek fans, Japanese technoporn producers, teenage hackers, AIDS activists, rap groups, and rock stars yield insights about the production and management of repressive technocultures, as well as new possibilities for the encouragement of technoliteracy, a requirement for the democratization of social communication.

However, museum collections as a whole are enormous in size and quantity and the question of how can they can be put to best use is ever present. When conventional exhibitions can only ever utilise a tiny proportion of them, what other uses of the collections are possible? Will their exploitation and use now destroy their value for future generations? Should they simply be kept safely and as economically as possible as a resource for the future? Fragments of the World examines these questions, first reviewing the history of collecting and of collections, then discussing the ways in which the collections themselves are being used today. Case studies of leading examples from around the world illustrate the discussion. Bringing together the thinking about museum collections with case studies of the ways in which different types of collection are used, the book provides a roadmap for museums to make better use of this wonderful resource.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2HNSjwa5Hn4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designing Usable Electronic Text, Second Edition","description":"Poor design and a failure to consider the user often act against the effectiveness in online communication.

I could not put this book down. It truly was terrifying and unutterably beautiful.\\" -Alison Borden, The Denver Post From the best-selling author of The Dog Stars, the story of two college students on a wilderness canoe trip--a gripping tale of a friendship tested by fire, white water, and violence Wynn and Jack have been best friends since freshman orientation, bonded by their shared love of mountains, books, and fishing. Wynn is a gentle giant, a Vermont kid never happier than when his feet are in the water. Jack is more rugged, raised on a ranch in Colorado where sleeping under the stars and cooking on a fire came as naturally to him as breathing. When they decide to canoe the Maskwa River in northern Canada, they anticipate long days of leisurely paddling and picking blueberries, and nights of stargazing and reading paperback Westerns. But a wildfire making its way across the forest adds unexpected urgency to the journey. When they hear a man and woman arguing on the fog-shrouded riverbank and decide to warn them about the fire, their search for the pair turns up nothing and no one. But: The next day a man appears on the river, paddling alone. Is this the man they heard? And, if he is, where is the woman? From this charged beginning, master storyteller Peter Heller unspools a headlong, heart-pounding story of desperate wilderness survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VZHODwAAQBAJ&dq=The+River&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technological Bluff","description":"M.

Concern is rooted in the storm clouds of 1938, when the same question arose just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War and the Holocaust. The contributors do not presume that the events of seventy years ago are identical with those today, or that they emanate from the same sources. However, the shared feeling is that Jewish communities worldwide are very much, once again at risk.In post 1938 Germany, the Nazi state began its march toward world conquest, with the destruction of European Jewry as its centerpiece. In an act of willful blindness, Western democratic leaders chose to negotiate and appease the Hitler regime. Many Jewish leaders also chose to minimize the risks. Seven years later, over 50 million people, including six million Jews had been liquidated. In 2008 extremist Islamic forces have spawned a global Jihad. State sponsored terrorism, a war against the West as well as against moderate Islamic states, once again holds the destruction of the Jewish people, and in particular the State of Israel, as a critical goal. The Iranian leadership proclaims that \\"a world without America and Israel is both possible and feasible.\\"Against such a diplomatic and historical background a conference was organized resulting in these essays written by Alan Dershowitz, Norman Podhoretz, Michael Walzer, Leonard Fein and David Price-Jones. The results are varied at the policy level, but unified in appreciator of a disturbing revival of inherited hatred and anti-Semitic outbreaks against Jews both within and outside of Europe.

I have tried to make the art of cooking easy to understand and even easier to master.

The field of knowledge most concerned with oral tradition is folkloristics, the study of folklore. Folklorist Alan Dundes has carefully and respectfully documented some of these unmistakable traces. These traces include numerous oral formulas repeated throughout the Qur'an as well as several traditional folktales. Just as Jesus effectively used parables to get His message across, so similar means are to be found in the Qur'an. The scholarly identification of formulas and folktales in the Qur'an represents an entirely new approach to this world-famous religious text. Not only does it provide insight into the basic composition of this sacred document, but for readers not previously familiar with the Qur'an, it pinpoints and makes accessible many of the principal themes contained therein.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yfo2AgAAQBAJ&dq=Fables+of+the+Ancients%3F:+Folklore+in+the+Qur%27an&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil and Mrs. Devine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YE5BAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Devil+and+Mrs.+Devine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ambedkar and Buddhism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XyOFX7yqJb4C&dq=Ambedkar+and+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frank Buchman's Secret","description":"Portrait of the founder of Moral Re-Armament.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_nlIAAAAMAAJ&dq=Frank+Buchman%27s+Secret&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GNMGAAAACAAJ&dq=Imaginary+Playmate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","description":"The fully automatic Nikon offers hundreds of options and incredible flexibility--and this \\"improved instruction guide\\" explains how to take full advantage of every one.

Heywood examines the different ways in which people have thought about childhood as a stage of life, the relationships of children with their families and peers, and the experiences of young people at work, in school and at the hands of various welfare institutions. The aim is to place the history of children and childhood firmly in its social and cultural context, without losing sight of the many individual experiences that have come down to us in diaries, autobiographies and oral testimonies. Heywood argues that there is a cruel paradox at the heart of childhood in the past. On the one hand, material conditions for children have generally improved in the West, however belatedly and unevenly, and they are now more valued than in the past. On the other hand, the business of preparing for adulthood has become more complicated in urban and industrial societies, as the young face a bewildering array of choices and expectations. A History of Childhood will be an essential introduction to the subject for students of history, the social sciences and cultural studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-oBhwnTQkbEC&dq=A+History+of+Childhood:+Children+and+Childhood+in+the+West+from+Medieval+to+Modern+Times+(Themes+in+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening the Heavens: Accounts of Divine Manifestations, 1820-1844","description":"Joseph Smith had only one request of the publisher of the Chicago Democrat, to whom he directed his now-famous Wentworth Letter: ?All that I shall ask at his hands, is, that he publish the account entire, ungarnished, and without misrepresentation.?

The relevant passages are presented in their entirety, plainness, and veracity, according to established standards of documentary editing. Here are the historical documents for the key events of the Restoration in which heavenly elements were powerfully evident: the First Vision, the translation of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the priesthood, the opening of the heavens, the outpouring of keys at the Kirtland Temple, and the mantle of Joseph Smith passing to Brigham Young.

The Chinese have now become masters at perpetuating the illusion of a newly emerging middle class of consumers - as long as you are willing to believe that they will arrive just in time for the next five year plan. Foreign investors have not learned the lessons of the past. Taking the bait yet again they have committed huge investments in plant and equipment - especially in the automotive sector - turning China into the manufacturing \\"factory floor\\" of the world. Imports from China alone have displaced 1.659 million US jobs in five years while creating only 199,000. Our trade deficit with China is fast approaching US$15 billion - per month. Recent technology accelerators have the potential to turn the current downturn in US manufacturing into a rout. This is not how the concept of globalization was supposed to play out for the American middle class.Our government and our business leaders seem unwilling or unable to level the playing field.

After a suspicious autopsy and a rushed burial, friends had Aquash exhumed and found a .32-caliber bullet in her skull. Using this scandal as a point of departure, The Unquiet Grave opens a tunnel into the dark side of the FBI and its subversion of American Indian activists. But the book also discovers things the Indians would prefer to keep buried. What unfolds is a sinuous tale of conspiracy, murder, and cover-up that stretches from the plains of South Dakota to the polished corridors of Washington, D.C. First-time author Steve Hendricks sued the FBI over several years to pry out thousands of unseen documents about the events. His work was supported by the prestigious Fund for Investigative Journalism. Hendricks, who has freelanced for The Nation, Boston Globe, Orion, and public radio, is one of those rare reporters whose investigative tenacity is accompanied by grace with the written word.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWTj6Ci0aGIC&dq=The+Unquiet+Grave+:+The+FBI+and+the+Struggle+for+the+Soul+of+Indian+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Wind Rising","description":"Set in the Blue Mountains of Pennsylvania before the French and Indian War, this novel tells the story of Sebastian, a man who had been kidnapped and raised by Native Americans.

The government has long collected information and assembled files on unidentified objects, extraterrestrial encounters, and strange convergences in the skies, but with new government secrets constantly being revealed (including finally admitting the existence of Area 51) is it too much to believe that it is hiding important information on close encounters, UFOs, and alien life? Nearly 100 sightings and other occurrences are thoroughly examined. Suppressed evidence, hidden plots, cover-ups, misleading statements, and documented connections to government intrigue are all addressed.

Steam locomotives grew scarcer by the month, as did rail passenger connections. With a keen eye for location and composition, James Gallagher in Trackside Maryland captures the drama and majesty of steam transportation in Maryland in its waning days, when passing trains left clouds of cinders and smoke behind them and the sound of steam whistles still echoed across the landscape -- all these sights and sounds giving way to modern diesel locomotives. Here Jacques Kelly's evocative prose accompanies Gallagher's ever vigilant lens. We are transported back to the last years of steam railroading. \\"Each of Jim's photographs tells a story and conveys mood, spirit, atmosphere, and character. The ground in his photographs rumbles. Some of the antique trains he photographed look as if they might rust and crumble before the end of their trip. Other photos impart a feeling of majesty and romance. And you don't have to be a train buff to appreciate them. Just step aboard and savor the results of Jim Gallagher's skill, luck, and persistence.\\" -- Jacques Kelly, from the Introduction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HCVSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Trackside+Maryland:+From+Railyard+to+Main+Line&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better spelling: Fourteen steps to spelling improvement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YebhPwAACAAJ&dq=Better+spelling:+Fourteen+steps+to+spelling+improvement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dolphins","description":"The extraordinary ability of dolphins to echolocate has fascinated scientists and the public since its discovery in the late 1950's.

Here are collected, for the first time, the accounts of four little known pieces of Confederate history. These four pieces are important components in understanding Confederate life in both small and large scale. The first section concerns the battle of Dinwiddie Court House on March 31, 1865, the last significant Confederate victory and the prelude to the battle of Five Forks the next day. The second section chronicles the experiences of Col. Charles C. Blacknall of the 23rd North Carolina Infantry, whose letters offer insight into the life of an officer and his personal struggles before his death from wounds received at the battle of Winchester. The third section examines a tragic and bloody series of conflicts and retaliations in southeast Missouri that demonstrated the revenge and violence against civilians that often erupted during the war. Finally, the history of General Hospital Number One, at Kittrell Springs, is analyzed, including accounts from the hospital's chaplain and its chief surgeon, and many of the last words they recorded in the performance of their duties. These four accounts illustrate very personal experiences of war by Confederate soldiers, in their own words from letters and diaries, period and contemporary photographs, and maps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-qxTPgAACAAJ&dq=Confederate+Courage+on+Other+Fields:+Four+Lesser+Known+Accounts+of+the+War+Between+the+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Bouquet for Mother (Notable Keepsake Gift Book)","description":"A new title in the !Notable Keepsake gift book series, this book serves as a richly deserved expression of thanks to every mother.

Nietzsche's madness may have caused him to lose perspective on the meaning of having dwelt in \\"a world of exalted and delicate things,\\" as he writes of himself in Ecce, but the original experience of elevation that comes of an abundance of life, of a surplus of life, certainly was not pathological.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T1mGVMJODR0C&dq=A+Commentary+on+Nietzsche%27s+%22Ecce+Homo%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concise Introduction to Syntactic Theory: The Government-Binding Approach","description":"This textbook is intended to give students a quick start in using theory to address syntactic questions.

These techniques, sometimes called brand-name or proprietary techniques, each provide a step-by-step protocol for proceeding from examination findings to adjustive and other treatment procedures. Until now, the most readily available descriptions of these techniques have taken the form of articles and seminar advertisements written and distributed by the technique innovators themselves. Major chiropractic technique textbooks frequently list these techniques and some provide synopses, but they do not include the detail really required for readers to come to any serious conclusions about their safety and efficacy. In Technique Systems in Chiropractic, the authors describe over two dozen technique systems in a non-judgmental but critical manner, summarizing the available research and drawing conclusions as to what is actually known about them, compared with what the technique innovators themselves say. KEY FEATURES - Describes and analyses over two dozen of the most widely known and used chiropractic technique systems, in' alphabetical order. - Uses a common format for each technique system, allowing the reader to easily locate desired information and draws comparisons between techniques. - Features chapters on chiropractic terminology, as well as examination and adiustive methods that are common to many technique systems. - Compiles and summarizes the relevant research on each technique, drawing summary conclusions and clearly identifying what is known and what is not known about each. - Explains why there have been so many technique systems in chiropractic, past and present, as this relates to issues of jurisprudence, practice parameters, and guidelines for care. - Explores the interface between chiropractic technique systems and the movement toward evidence-based chiropractic (EBC). Presents demographic information on the rates of utilization of each technique in Canada and the United States. - Includes a glossary of technique-specific terms and jargon. Technique Systems in Chiropractic provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art resource on the different technique systems in common use by chiropractors throughout the world. It will provide students and practitioners of chiropractic with the easy access they need to enrich their knowledge of the vast array of chiropractic technique procedures, whether to whet their interest in pursuing further training in given technique systems, or to incorporate various of these procedures into the more generic, eclectic practice or chiropractic to which many practitioners seem to be drawn at this time.

Covey showed us how to become as effective as it is possible to be. In his long-awaited new book, THE 8th HABIT, he opens up an entirely new dimension of human potential, and shows us how to achieve greatness in any position and any venue. All of us, Covey says, have within us the means for greatness. To tap into it is a matter of finding the right balance of four human attributes: talent, need, conscience and passion. At the nexus of these four attributes is what Covey calls voice - the unique, personal significance we each possess. Covey exhorts us all to move beyond effectiveness into the realm of greatness - and he shows us how to do so, by engaging our strengths and locating our powerful, individual voices. Why do we need this new habit? Because we have entered a new era in human history. The world is a profoundly different place than when THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE was originally published in 1989. The challenges and complexity we face today are of a different order of magnitude. We enjoy far greater autonomy in all areas of our lives, and along with this freedom comes the expectation that we will manage ourselves, instead of being managed by others. At the same time, we struggle to feel engaged, fulfilled and passionate. Tapping into the higher reaches of human genius and motivation to find our voice requires a new mindset, a new skill-set, a new tool-set - in short, a whole new habit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LZyYKAb8Be4C&dq=The+8th+Habit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Tuscany & Umbria's Best-Loved Driving Tours","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Pirates of Shan (A Rick Brant Science-Adventure Story)","description":"Rick Brant and his pal, Scotty, are plunged into danger and excitement when they encounter the cutthroat pirates of Shan in the heart of the Pacific tropics.

Drawing from the tradition established by American painters of the Hudson River School--artists like Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, and George Inness--author and painter Ken Salaz reveals great masters' philosophy and methods, updating their approaches for the contemporary landscape painter. Beginning painters are given the basic tools and step-by-step demonstrations, intermediate painters are challenged with unpublished techniques that allow them to break through to the next level, and advanced painters learn to apply their skills under unified theories. Landscapes in Oil devotes a chapter to each of the fundamental elements of landscape painting--drawing, value, color, composition, and light quality--and offers critical advice on selecting tools and materials, choosing colors, and structuring your palette for best results. Emphasizing the necessity of plein air drawing and painting, Salaz demonstrates how to translate small, quick studies made outdoors into full-scale studio paintings. He provides detailed step-by-step breakdowns of the creation of four of his own paintings, focusing not only on application but also on the ideas that underpin every decision a landscape painter must make. The scores of landscape masterworks, past and present, that illustrate this book have been carefully chosen for their aesthetic power and because each embodies a specific aspect of the landscape painter's craft. For Salaz, landscape painting is a noble pursuit, and the goal of the landscape artist is not to paint \\"pretty pictures\\" but to create compelling images that express human beings' profound connection to nature in all its diversity and grandeur. At a time when classical landscape is enjoying a renaissance in art schools, ateliers, and galleries across North America, this book is an essential resource for beginning and experienced painters alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8CGDwAAQBAJ&dq=LANDSCAPE+PAINTING+IN+OIL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","description":"Here is the complete learning guide that teaches American Sign Language by \\"category,\\" the most popular and preferred method of teaching and learning.

People expected painting, sculpture, architecture, and other forms of visual art to have a meaningful effect on their lives, \\" write the authors of this important new look at Italian Renaissance art. A glance at the pages of Art in Renaissance Italy shows at once its freshness and breadth of approach, which includes thorough explanation into how and why works of art, buildings, prints, and other kinds of art came to be. This book discusses how men and women of the Renissance regarded art and artists as well as why works of Renaissance art look the way they do, and what this means to us. It covers not only Florence and Rome, but also Venice and the Veneto, Assisi, Siena, Milan, Pavia, Padua, Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, Urbino, and Naples -- each governed in a distinctly different manner, every one with its own political and social structures that inevitably affected artistic styles. Spanning more than three centuries, the narrative brings to life the rich tapestry of Italian Renaissance society and the art works that are its enduring legacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EFhVehAvVyUC&dq=Art+in+Renaissance+Italy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Was Annie","description":"A young Navajo girl attempts to prevent the passage of time when she learns that her grandmother's days are numbered","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HtNIPwAACAAJ&dq=One+Was+Annie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STORIES FOR SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS","description":"The Puffin Book of Stories for Five-year-olds edited by Wendy Cooling brings together stories perfectly suited for every five-year-old.

Charms and beseechings, hexes and potions, all have a place in the lives of the people of this world. Dowsers find water, the second sight warns of dangers to come, and a torch can read a person's future---or their heart. In this world where \\"knacks\\" abound, Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a very special man indeed. He's a Maker; he has the knack of understanding how things are put together, how to create them, repair them, keep them whole, or tear them down. He can heal hearts as well as bones, he build a house, he can calm the waters or blow up a storm. And he can teach his knack to others, to the measure of their own talent. Alvin has been trying to avert the terrible war that his wife, Peggy, a torch of extraordinary power, has seen down the life-lines of every American. Now she has sent him down the Mizzippy to the city of New Orleans, or Nueva Barcelona as they call it under Spanish occupation. Alvin doesn't know exactly why he's there, but when he and his brother-in-law, Arthur Stuart, find lodgings with a family of abolitionists who know Peggy, he suspects he'll find out soon. But Nueva Barcelona is about to experience a plague, and Alvin's efforts to protect his friends by keeping them healthy will create more danger than he could ever have suspected. And in saving the poor people of the city, Alvin will be put to the greatest test of his life---a test that will draw on all his power. For the time has come for him to turn to his old friend Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet who controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy.

Determined to speak out more actively for both Holocaust survivors and the disenfranchised everywhere, he sets himself a challenge: \\"I will become militant. I will teach, share, bear witness. I will reveal and try to mitigate the victims' solitude.\\" He makes words his weapon, and in these pages we relive with him his unstinting battles. We see him meet with world leaders and travel to regions ruled by war, dictatorship, racism, and exclusion in order to engage the most pressing issues of the day. We see him in the Soviet Union defending persecuted Jews and dissidents; in South Africa battling apartheid and supporting Mandela's ascension; in Cambodia and in Bosnia, calling on the world to face the atrocities; in refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia as an emissary for President Clinton. He chastises Ronald Reagan for his visit to the German military cemetery at Bitburg. He supports Lech Walesa but challenges some of his views. He confronts Francois Mitterrand over the misrepresentation of his activities in Vichy France. He does battle with Holocaust deniers. He joins tens of thousands of young Austrians demonstrating against renascent fascism in their country. He receives the Nobel Peace Prize. Through it all, Wiesel remains deeply involved with his beloved Israel, its leaders and its people, and laments its internal conflicts. He recounts the behind-the-scenes events that led to the establishment of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. He shares the feelings evoked by his return to Auschwitz, by his recollections of Yitzhak Rabin, and by his memories of his own vanished family. This is the magnificent finale of a historic memoir.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ON6QR2zhQckC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selling Out","description":"\\"From celebrated music writer Dan Ozzi comes a comprehensive chronicle of the punk music scene's evolution from the early nineties to the mid-aughts, following eleven bands as they dissolved, \\"sold out,\\" and rose to surprise stardom.

Drawing on work in cognitive psychology and philosophy, this framework begins with the observation that to be conscious is literally to have a point of view. From this starting point, the book develops a descriptive scheme that allows perceptual, symbolic, and emotional awareness to be discussed in common theoretical terms, compatible with a computational view of the mind. A central theme is our experience of ourselves as agents, consciously controlling activities situated in environments. In contrast to previous theories of consciousness, the experienced cognition framework emphasizes the changes in conscious control as individuals acquire skills. The book is divided into four parts. The first introduces the central themes and places them in the context of information-processing theory and empirical research on cognitive skill. The second develops the theoretical framework, emphasizing the unity of perceptual, symbolic, and emotional awareness and the relation of conscious to nonconscious processes. The third applies the experienced cognition framework to a variety of topics in cognitive psychology, including working memory, problem solving, and reasoning. It also includes discussions of everyday action, skill, and expertise, focusing on changes in conscious control with increasing fluency. The last concludes the book by evaluating the recent debate on the \\"cognitive unconscious\\" and implicit cognition from the perspective of experienced cognition, and considering the prospects for a cognitive psychology focused on persons. This book addresses many of the issues raised in philosophical treatments of consciousness from the point of view of empirical cognitive psychology. For example, the structure of conscious mental states is addressed by considering how to describe them in terms of variables suitable for information-processing theory. Understanding conscious states in this way also provides a basis for developing empirical hypotheses, for example, about the relation of emotion and cognition, about the apparent \\"mindlessness\\" of skilled activity, and about the nature and role of goals in guiding activity. Criticisms of the computational view of mind are addressed by showing that the role of first-person perspectives in cognition can be described and investigated in theoretical terms compatible with a broadly-conceived information-processing theory of cognition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yVh4AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rose Is Rose: 15th Anniversary Collection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DaI7xQEACAAJ&dq=Rose+Is+Rose:+15th+Anniversary+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science Of Poker","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Country Home Plans","description":"The Architecture of Country Houses is a lengthy pattern book full of designs for cottages, interiors and furniture.

Tetsuden Kashima uses newly obtained records to trace this process back to the 1920s, when a nascent imprisonment organization was developed to prepare for a possible war with Japan, and follows it in detail through the war years. Along with coverage of the well-known incarceration camps, the author discusses the less familiar and very different experiences of people of Japanese descent in the Justice and War Departments? internment camps that held internees from the continental U.S. and from Alaska, Hawaii, and Latin America. Utilizing extracts from diaries, contemporary sources, official communications, and interviews, Kashima brings an array of personalities to life on the pages of his book ? those whose unbiased assessments of America?s Japanese ancestry population were discounted or ignored, those whose works and actions were based on misinformed fears and racial animosities, those who tried to remedy the inequities of the system, and, by no means least, the prisoners themselves. Kashima?s interest in this episode began with his own unanswered questions about his father?s wartime experiences. From this very personal motivation, he has produced a panoramic and detailed picture ? without rhetoric and emotionalism and supported at every step by documented fact ? of a government that failed to protect a group of people for whom it had forcibly assumed total responsibility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fHoUCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roadmap to the Virginia SOL: EOC Virginia and United States History (State Test Preparation Guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5r8S9sPkYwkC&dq=Roadmap+to+the+Virginia+SOL:+EOC+Virginia+and+United+States+History+(State+Test+Preparation+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acoustic chamber music sets (1899-1926): A discography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PmZLAAAAYAAJ&dq=Acoustic+chamber+music+sets+(1899-1926):+A+discography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legends & lore of southern Illinois","description":"In a dark future, when North America has split into two warring nations, 15-year-olds Day, a famous criminal, and June, the brilliant soldier hired to capture him, discover that they have a common enemy.P.

In myth and memory, he is always the Great Emancipator and savior of the Union, second in stature only to George Washington. But was Lincoln always so exalted? Was he, as some historians argue, a poor President, deeply disliked, whose legacy was ennobled only by John Wilkes Booth's bullet? In this fascinating book, a leading historian finally takes the full measure of Lincoln's reputation. Drawing on a remarkable range of primary documents, speeches, newspaper accounts and editorials, private letters, memoirs, and other sources--Hans L. Trefousse gives us the voices of Lincoln's own time. From North and South, at home and abroad, here are politicians and ordinary people, soldiers and statesmen, abolitionists and slaveholders alike, in a rich chorus of American opinion.

We are also introduced to some of the lesser-known poets such as Paul Gerhardt, Samuel Crossman and Samuel Medley.

More than this, we also discover how their individual personalities and circumstances are reflected in the hymns they wrote.We can only stand amazed as we read of the demonstration of their faith, often in the face of severe persecution and hardship, which has been so wonderfully expressed in verse. It is our privilege to have available to us the lives and work of such gifted writers to enhance our worship.

Between 1920 and 1970, cosmology transformed into a branch of physics. With this remarkably rapid change came a theory that would finally lend empirical support to many long-held beliefs about the origins and development of the entire universe: the theory of the big bang. In this book, Helge Kragh presents the development of scientific cosmology for the first time as a historical event, one that embroiled many famous scientists in a controversy over the very notion of an evolving universe with a beginning in time. In rich detail he examines how the big-bang theory drew inspiration from and eventually triumphed over rival views, mainly the steady-state theory and its concept of a stationary universe of infinite age. In the 1920s, Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lema?tre showed that Einstein's general relativity equations possessed solutions for a universe expanding in time. Kragh follows the story from here, showing how the big-bang theory evolved, from Edwin Hubble's observation that most galaxies are receding from us, to the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Sir Fred Hoyle proposed instead the steady-state theory, a model of dynamic equilibrium involving the continuous creation of matter throughout the universe. Although today it is generally accepted that the universe started some ten billion years ago in a big bang, many readers may not fully realize that this standard view owed much of its formation to the steady-state theory. By exploring the similarities and tensions between the theories, Kragh provides the reader with indispensable background for understanding much of today's commentary about our universe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9OcSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's national monuments and historic sites;: A guide in pictures and text to our magnificent natural and historic treasures,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7HsYAAAAIAAJ&dq=America%27s+national+monuments+and+historic+sites%3B:+A+guide+in+pictures+and+text+to+our+magnificent+natural+and+historic+treasures,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English Presbyterians: From Elizabethan Puritanism to Modern Unitarianism","description":"Report for Bachelor of Applied Science (Marine Engineering)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m-ocAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+English+Presbyterians:+From+Elizabethan+Puritanism+to+Modern+Unitarianism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Competitive Dominoes: How To Play Like A Champion","description":"From general principles to advanced skills, this fully illustrated, in-depth guide takes readers through every aspect of the game of dominoes. 131 illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=McoMAAAACAAJ&dq=Competitive+Dominoes:+How+To+Play+Like+A+Champion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Carmelite,: A novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How To Draw Deltora Monsters","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bear Trading","description":"The first edition of this book was published during a raging bull run and still proved a sell-out success. The reason is simple -- the bears are always with us. Fat bears, slow bears and little bears are not the traders' enemy. When markets stumble, private traders DO make money. Already, thousands of Australians earn their living by trading the financial markets. Many traders have progressed, step-by-step, from long-term investing to position equity trading, acquiring their skills against the background of the seemingly ever-rising market. They may have found that trading for a living is hardly the easiest of careers, even in the good times, when the bulls are running. They wonder if it is possible to continue trading when the market is rocked by the bears. Daryl Guppy knows from experience that it is. The bears are always with us. Even at the height of a bull run, still some corners of the equity market are in their grip and he shows how to trade these 'bear dips'. He has also traded during the resources and Asian bear markets and many of the examples in this book are trades he has personally taken. There are two sides to the market -- long and short. The author explores the short side -- selling high and buying low -- and demonstrates practical ways to trade these warrants and options. In this comprehensive book, Daryl Guppy discusses a broad sample of methods the private trader can use not only to survive, but to prosper in falling or static markets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NeLuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Bear+Trading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Ladies of the Windswept Moor","description":"Ignoring warnings, young Janet Clarissa Clarke goes to Cheviot Chase, determined to prove herself a capable restorer of Lord Rathbone's priceless collection of paintings, and she falls under the nobleman's sinister spell","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gRur9L8WMocC&dq=Lost+Ladies+of+the+Windswept+Moor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 5: Best Of The Eighties Book 1","description":"The awesome eighties a time when pop culture inevitably ruled America as a former actor rose to become the nation's President!

Through Climacus, Kierkegaard contrasts the paradoxes of Christianity with Greek and modern philosophical thinking. In Philosophical Fragments he begins with Greek Platonic philosophy, exploring the implications of venturing beyond the Socratic understanding of truth acquired through recollection to the Christian experience of acquiring truth through grace. Published in 1844 and not originally planned to appear under the pseudonym Climacus, the book varies in tone and substance from the other works so attributed, but it is dialectically related to them, as well as to the other pseudonymous writings. The central issue of Johannes Climacus is doubt. Probably written between November 1842 and April 1843 but unfinished and published only posthumously, this book was described by Kierkegaard as an attack on modern speculative philosophy by \\"means of the melancholy irony, which did not consist in any single utterance on the part of Johannes Climacus but in his whole life. . . . Johannes does what we are told to do--he actually doubts everything--he suffers through all the pain of doing that, becomes cunning, almost acquires a bad conscience. When he has gone as far in that direction as he can go and wants to come back, he cannot do so. . . . Now he despairs, his life is wasted, his youth is spent in these deliberations. Life does not acquire any meaning for him, and all this is the fault of philosophy.\\" A note by Kierkegaard suggests how he might have finished the work: \\"Doubt is conquered not by the system but by faith, just as it is faith that has brought doubt into the world!.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IX2hX2kHg3kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures in Odyssey Passages Spring Sampler","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Consolidated B-24 Liberator","description":"One of a series of books designed for the layman which looks at military aircraft that have recently arrived in the marketplace.

The study presents extensive evidence showing that the famous exchange of telegrams between the artist Frederic Remington and newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst-in which Hearst is said to have vowed to \\"furnish the war\\" with Spain-almost certainly never took place.

It begins with the first theories and experiments in flight, including the attempts to fly by jumping from towers and the experiences of the lighter-than-air flight using balloons. It then analyses the experiments with kites and models in an attempt to understand the principles of aerodynamics. All this leads up to the first successful powered flights, culminating in the achievement of the Wright Brothers, whose flight at Kitty Hawk represented the first successful powered, sustained, and controlled flight. The remainder of the book covers the creation of an aeroplane industry putting aeroplanes to work, refining airframes and engines, adapting aeroplanes to fly from water, and understanding safety issues.

Years ago, when I was training to become a hospital chaplain, my supervisor offered a startling observation: \\"You will learn that chaplaincy and the art of caring for another during times of grief have little to do with a job description and everything to do with the interruptions.\\" If I Could Mend Your Heart, is all about life's interruptions - the losses, the endings, the upheavals.

The use of forensic evidence in criminal investigations and trials is analysed in detail. This book uncovers the way in which this new reliance on forensic technologies has gained a foothold within the criminal justice system, and the risks and dangers that this can pose.

Artists often spurned the cities, living and working in the numerous art colonies that sprang up throughout the country in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One of the best known of these colonies formed in 1898 on the banks of the Delaware River north of Philadelphia, centered in the picturesque village of New Hope, Bucks County. Known as the Pennsylvania impressionists, this group of artists played a dominant role in the American art world of the 1910s and 1920s, winning major awards and sitting on prestigious exhibition juries. Their work was celebrated for its freedom from European influence, and was praised by the noted painter and critic Guy Pene du Bois as \\"our first truly national expression.\\" Many of the Pennsylvania impressionists both studied and taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and their stylistic roots hearkened back to the \\"academy realism\\" practiced by Thomas Eakins and his followers. Edward Redfield was the generally acknowledged stylistic leader of the New Hope painters; his vigorously realistic, unsentimental brand of impressionism influenced several generations of artists associated with the group. However, what most characterized Pennsylvania impressionism was not a single, unified style but rather the emergence of many mature, distinctive voices: Daniel Garber's luminous, poetic renditions of the Delaware River; Fern Coppedge's colorful village scenes; Robert Spencer's lyrical views of mills and tenements; John Folinsbee's moody, expressionistic snowscapes; and William L. Lathrop's deeply felt, evocative Bucks County vistas. Pennsylvania impressionist artwork is now widely collected, and many works in private hands are shown here, as well as the holdings of the James A. Michener Museum, recognized as the most extensive public collection. Pennsylvania Impressionism explores in comprehensive and sumptuous detail this important American movement. Principally authored by the Michener's Senior Curator Brian H. Peterson, the book contains additional essays by art historians William H. Gerdts, Professor Emeritus of Art History at the City University of New York, and Sylvia Yount, Margaret and Terry Stent Curator of American Art at the High Museum in Atlanta. Also included are biographies of more than 75 artists and extensive color reproductions of their work. Intended for both a general audience and aficionados, this book will become the principal source for information about this important branch of American impressionism. Also of Interest  Edward W.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming  unstuck in time.  An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut s writing the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as  the kind of writer who made people young people especially want to write.  George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be  the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era s uncertainties.  Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.

One the most important figures in the history of art, his monumental paintings in the Sistine Chapel, his sculpture David in Florence, and his Piet; at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome are among the greatest human achievements of all time and remain the most visited and admired works of art in the world. Michelangelo's life has been the subject of many biographies over the centuries, but it was not until the appearance of John Addington Symonds's The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti, in 1893, that a biographer had complete access to the artist's family archives. The Buonarroti archives were to be available to the public with the passing of the last family member, but even when that event occurred, in 1858, material from the archives remained closely guarded and only fragments emerged through the hands of family friends. The Italian government, predisposed to Symonds for his impeccable scholarship of Renaissance art, gave Symonds full access to the Buonarroti archives in the 1880s, the first independent scholar so honored. With the ability to consult the massive amount of material in the archives, Symonds produced the first documented, and considered by many still to be the best, biography of Michelangelo. Symonds's expertise as a historian and critic gives added depth to this biography, and it is here that the public first learned that translations of Michelangelo's poetry had been altered to opaque the artist's sexuality. Yet this great work, the last of Symonds's life, has largely been forgotten by students of Michelangelo. In this new edition, the first in more than fifty years, preeminent art historian Creighton E. Gilbert reintroduces Symonds's masterful study of Michelangelo to a new audience through a discussion of the historical context in which the biography appeared, a biographical sketch of Symonds, an openly gay man who worked rigorously to evaluate and promote the contributions of gay artists and scholars to mainstream life, and concludes with an appreciation of The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti, for its scholarly and literary merits, as an account of the most brilliant painter and sculptor of the Italian Renaissance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a--Alw8V7koC&dq=The+life+of+Michelangelo+Buonarroti,+(The+Modern+library+of+the+world%27s+best+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Godowsky Collection: Original Compositions for Piano Solo, Vol. 1","description":"One of the most admired qualities of Claude Debussy s music has been its seemingly effortless evocation and assimilation of exotic musical strains.

With what mnemonic conventions was Scripture conveyed in a largely oral world, and can those methods still be effective? The Bible was fashioned for the ear using popular symmetrical patterns and rhetorical devices that helped listeners remember without a ready 'text' for reference. These astonishing literary 'shapes' are both mnemonic devices and interpretative aids. They offer ideal paradigms for teaching the books, yet they have remained largely dormant under the guise of an alien medium the printed page.

Nikita Khrushchev is politically adept, visionary, and locked in a fight with the Politburo and a battle with Mao and the Chinese. His country and his political future are in trouble because he has opened doors to the West and espoused the doctrine of peaceful coexistence. Meanwhile, the arms race is crushing the Soviet economy and there is unrest throughout the Communist empire. Changes are imperative. The army must be reduced, money redirected to a consumer economy, and the US neutralized. But the old boars of the Red Army will not be easily displaced; its leaders are intent on saving their country from Khrushchev. A cabal of senior Red Army patriots are led by a man who the world thinks is Khrushchev's unswerving toady. The game is treason, and the tools are Albania's mad-dog leaders, for whom assassination is second nature. What begins subtly soon turns brittle. A rocket technician disappears before a major accident at the Soviet Space Center. In Belgrade a psychotic CIA agent escapes an ambush, vows revenge, and disappears. Khrushchev turns to the Special Operations Group, the elite hunting team featured in the author's prequel, THE BERKUT. In Washington the Bay of Pigs invasion is in the final planning stages, and its timing is tied to the missing CIA agent. He must be found. Two teams, one from Russia and one from the United States, begin a desperate hunt that leads them on an inward spiral toward each other and to a lethal showdown at the 1961 summit in Vienna. There they find themselves in an uneasy alliance as they race to find the American renegade and the Albanian death team, both groups pawns in a global chess game. With a vast canvas of disparate characters and events, The Domino Conspiracy is a coruscating tour de force. Breathtakingly suspenseful, it lays open the myths of the Soviet monolith and reveals the delicate seeds of glasnost and perestroika, movements that were not to flower until three decades later. Readers know how the Soviet story ended; now they will see how it all began.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=icyhCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Sound Smart: A Quick and Witty Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cLLvNFqaqkIC&dq=How+to+Sound+Smart:+A+Quick+and+Witty+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boxes","description":"Annie's Uncle Marco goes on one of his mysterious trips, leaving her in charge of two sealed boxes on one condition: she must not open either one while he is away.

However, none address the fundamental questions of different structures of production and how the consumer relates to the product - this book is the first to do just that. Wine and Society: the cultural and social context of wine production and consumption looks at the relationship between wine production and marketing, focussing in consumer behaviour and cultural attitudes. Divided into four parts, it examines the context of wine production, the wine consumer and the social context of wine, discussing the following themes: * That the core of wine production and consumption is shaped by historical, geographical and cultural factors. * Wine production - European and new world looking at the different kinds of producer and how the varying background of each shapes their perspective on what they produce * Terroir and appellations: why demarcation and sense of place became important, how they are used to achieve marketing differentiation, and the 'benefits' (or otherwise) to the customer. * The contemporary wine consumer and lifestyle factors - looking at wine clubs, tourism, education, culture and literature * The politics and economics of wine - from supporting rural industries in France to protecting customers from deception and health risks. Suitable for third year and post-graduate students of hospitality, wine (both in production and marketing), wine tourism, gastronomy and related courses, it encourages students to think critically about the issues raised by using real life case studies and examples from around the world, also including press releases and marketing campaigns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TP3LymQQEkAC&dq=Wine+and+Society:+The+Cultural+and+Social+Context+of+a+Drink&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird: The Legend of Charlie Parker","description":"More than to any other musician, the credit for the birth of modern jazz belongs to Charles \\"Yardbird\\" Parker--known to his friends and fans simply as \\"Bird.\\" Parker's virtuoso technique, melodic genius, and inspired improvisations helped launch a whole new era in jazz, an era that began with bop and culminated in the \\"cool\\" or modern jazz of the fifties. His brilliant handling of the alto saxophone inspired a generation of jazz musicians; without him, there would have been no John Coltrane, no Ornette Coleman, no jazz as we know it today. Parker died in 1955 at the age of thirty-five. He left behind a rich legacy of musical innovation and a legend of self-destructive dissipation that made him a votive hero of the hipsters and the beat generation. For this first full-length reminiscence, Reisner interviewed eighty-one of Parker's friends, relatives, and fellow performers. From Charlie Mingus, one of the few real innovators since Bird, and Dizzy Gillespie, whom Parker once called \\"the other half of my heart,\\" to jazz historian Rudi Blesh and Parker's mother, each remembers Bird in his or her own special way. Thus from the shards and splinters of firsthand reminiscence emerges a telling mosaic of Parker's brief but intense career: the indulgences in drugs and alcohol; the legendary bouts of lovemaking; the temperamental behavior on and off the bandstand; the jam sessions at the Harlem jazz club Minton's Playhouse with Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk; and the historic firing from Birdland, the club which took its name from this larger-than-life musician and man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AT8IAQAAMAAJ&dq=Bird:+The+Legend+of+Charlie+Parker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel of John: Introduction, Exposition and Notes","description":"New in the Eerdmans Classic Biblical Commentaries collection In this classic commentary on the Gospel of John, first published in 1983, F.

To McCarthy, Florence, or Firenze, is a place of ageless enchantment, from the Duomo to the fortressed palaces. The Renaissance began here; art and architecture flourished.

That almost captures the flavor of Sue Spencers real-life book filled with comical and hair-raising adventures. Her blithe and breezy memoir takes readers along on an unusual armchair-travel escape, roaming across five continents and recapturing memorable cultures and eras -- some now vanished forever. Spencer writes humorously about all the countries, the people and what she learned along the way including such pearls of wisdom as how to get ants out of the sugar, how to shrink heads, and why one must not point an emu bone at a stranger. When the author, with her mining engineer husband and three of their five children, gamely moved to West Africa in the 1950s, she little knew what lay ahead. I was a young housewife who read only Dr. Spock and Betty Crocker, and had never even seen Paris, much less Gbangbama, she says. I had so much to learn. Living in bush country mining camps for 10 years, they traveled by dugout canoe and shared a six-room mud house with a pet mongoose and, for awhile, two leopard cubs. Nightmarish bugs and snakes were just a few of the novelties. Armies of ferocious ants invaded the bedroom, requiring the Spencers to make a running leap for the window in their nightclothes. When a cobra crawled in the front door, the houseboy calmly chopped it in half with a machete. Village prostitutes invited themselves into the living room, urging the author to join them in a dance that would have embarrassed Salome. Communal life amid curious neighbors made daily routine unusually interesting, especially when the makeshift shower was outdoors. Fresh vegetables and meat were scarce and eggs nonexistent, but the family learned to enjoy native delicacies including roasted termites sprinkled with salt. Surviving it all with a sense of humor, the undaunted Spencers moved on to Australia. In their trusty Land Rover, they bounced along the dusty tracks of the Outback, where rain was so scarce people stopped whatever they were doing to watch any shower. Daily life among kangaroos and wallabies, aborigines, sheep ranchers and fossickers (as oldtime miners were called) meant a constant series of surprises. Sue Spencer, jotting down her experiences as she went, explored remote and intriguing spots, from the ghost town, Coolgardie, to Madmans Track, Alice Springs and Booloogoolooroo. After Australia, she traipsed off to South America, still following her miner husband, to share further challenges, curious sights and expeditions in Brazil, Paraguay and Guyana. Up and down the Amazon, from cosmopolitan Ro to charming Asuncin or scruffy but scenic Iguac, with the Spencers there was never a dull moment. Whenever they took a break from global wanderings, they returned to Bugtussle, their beloved Florida farm, surrounded by marsh, sand, mosquitoes and alligators. The Bugtussle background helped make them capable of surviving anywhere, according to the author. Its simple, she says. Be prepared to be wet in the rainy season, dry in the dry season, and dont fight the bugs immoderately. With a down-to-earth style, the book blends travel anecdotes with wry reflections on life around the world and at home. The saga spans 40 years of shifting scenes, experiences and changes. Throughout it all, the stories reflect the spirit of a woman living vibrantly -- and irrepressibly seeing the funny side of things -- at any age, under any conditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BXCznAEACAAJ&dq=More+Creeks+I+Have+Been+Up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Indulgence: Easy, Everyday Things to Do for Me","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Joy","description":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER Two great spiritual masters share their own hard-won wisdom about living with joy even in the face of adversity. The occasion was a big birthday. And it inspired two close friends to get together for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet, despite having experienced great personal and national suffering. From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake, the first being their personal stories and teachings about joy. Both the Dalai Lama and Tutu have been tested by extraordinary adversity, oppression, and conflict. The second layer consists of the exciting research into joy as well as the other qualities essential for any enduring happiness, like gratitude, humility, humour, compassion, generosity, and forgiveness. And the third encompasses practical exercises and guidance based on the Dalai Lama's and Tutu's own daily practices, which anchor their emotional and spiritual lives. Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and even wise-cracking humour, how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9CPXCwAAQBAJ&dq=Joy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncertainty and Ground Conditions: A Risk Management Approach","description":"All civil engineering and construction projects require some sort of solid foundation, but ground conditions bring some degree of uncertainty to every project.

Our narrator, the somewhat mysterious Mr Jones, is travelling through the Holy Land and lamenting his lack of a companion. When a young Mr John Smith requests to accompany him on his travels, having also been suffering with loneliness, Mr Smith gladly accepts. Over the course of their journey the pair become close, though all is not as it seems. Dealing with the topics of gender stereotypes and gender expectations of the time, this is a thrilling short story of deception and disguise. Anthony Trollope (1815  1882) was a Victorian writer and author of 47 novels. He also wrote an autobiography, short stories and plays, travel articles, reviews and lectures. A prolific writer, he made no secret of the fact that money was his motivation for writing  an admission which raised eyebrows among his literary contemporaries at the time. The amount of works Trollope authored are testament to his belief in hard work. His first successful novel was The Warden followed by its sequel, Barchester Towers. The Chronicles of Barsetshire are perhaps his most well-known series of novels, though many of his works have been adapted for TV and radio, starring many familiar faces such as Alan Rickman, David Tennant, Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander. Alongside his literary career, Trollope also worked for some time for the Post Office and is credited with the introduction of the iconic post box to Britain. A memorial to Anthony Trollope was unveiled in Poets  Corner in Westminster Abbey in 1993.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2j4_EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intimate Friendship with God: Through Understanding the Fear of the Lord","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Vital Breath","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Deal With Teachers Who Are Angry, Troubled, Exhausted, or Just Plain Confused","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pragmatic Development (Essays in Developmental Science)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cutting the Pain Away (Psy) (Encyclopedia of Psychological Disorders)","description":"Abnormal and clinical psychology courses are offered in psychology programs at universities worldwide, but the most recent major encyclopedia on the topic was published many years ago.

The microfinance revolution has allowed more than 150 million poor people around the world to receive small loans without collateral, build up assets, and buy insurance. The idea that providing access to reliable and affordable financial services can have powerful economic and social effects has captured the imagination of policymakers, activists, bankers, and researchers around the world; the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize went to microfinance pioneer Muhammed Yunis and Grameen Bank of Bangladesh. This book offers an accessible and engaging analysis of the global expansion of financial markets in poor communities. It introduces readers to the key ideas driving microfinance, integrating theory with empirical data and addressing a range of issues, including savings and insurance, the role of women, impact measurement, and management incentives. This second edition has been updated throughout to reflect the latest data. A new chapter on commercialization describes the rapid growth in investment in microfinance institutions and the tensions inherent in the efforts to meet both social and financial objectives. The chapters on credit contracts, savings and insurance, and gender have been expanded substantially; a new section in the chapter on impact measurement describes the growing importance of randomized controlled trials; and the chapter on managing microfinance offers a new perspective on governance issues in transforming institutions. Appendixes and problem sets cover technical material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XSo3AgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Economics+of+Microfinance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE GORGON - and Other Beastly Tales: Anna Medea; Meow; The Hunting of Death: The Unicorn; Magritte's Secret Agent; Money's Stagger; Sirriamnis; Because Our Skins Are Finer; Quatt Sup; Draco Draco; La Reine Blanche","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Facility Programming and the Corporate Architect (Architectural Media Monographs)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stepdads: Stories of Love, Hope, and Repair","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Emma at the Beach","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of the O'Dalys;: The story of the ancient Irish sept; the race of Dalach of Corca Adaimh;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5sE6AAAAMAAJ&dq=History+of+the+O%27Dalys%3B:+The+story+of+the+ancient+Irish+sept%3B+the+race+of+Dalach+of+Corca+Adaimh%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for Life","description":"What makes a Catholic a Catholic?

The daughter of an English Christian mother and an Iranian Zoroastrian father, Nesta Ramazani sketches her personal life story against the backdrop of a society marked by the fusion of Iranian, Islamic, and Western cultures, and by the efforts of an authoritarian state to force modernization on a traditional society. Within this multicultural tapestry of personal, cultural, and national life, the author portrays how she came to love Persian and Western music, poetry, and dance. But translating this love into practice seemed an insurmountable task until an American woman pioneered the establishment of the first indigenous Iranian ballet company. As a member of this troupe, the author violated convention, performing first in her native land and then traveling abroad to exhibit this beautiful synthesis of Persian/Western forms to foreign audiences. The significance of this work transcends an autobiography penned by an Iranian woman still a taboo in traditional Iranian society it is a unique microcosm of today s universal quest for a dialogue among civilizations. Ramazani s story will appeal not only to students of Iran, the Middle East, and women s studies, but also to general readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ctKFWg0pjaIC&dq=The+Dance+of+the+Rose+and+the+Nightingale+(Gender,+Culture,+and+Politics+in+the+Middle+East)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is music 7,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Your Personality, Your Health","description":"Connecting Personality with the Human Energy System, Chakras, and Wellness!

From the small coastal town of Senjan, notorious for its pirates, a young woman sets out to find vengeance for her lost family. That same spring, from the wealthy city-state of Seressa, famous for its canals and lagoon, come two very different people: a young artist traveling to the dangerous east to paint the grand khalif at his request--and possibly to do more--and a fiercely intelligent, angry woman posing as a doctor's wife but sent by Seressa as a spy. The trading ship that carries them is commanded by the accomplished younger son of a merchant family, ambivalent about the life he's been born to live. And farther east a boy trains to become a soldier in the elite infantry of the khalif--to win glory in the war everyone knows is coming. As these lives entwine, their fates--and those of many others--will hang in the balance when the khalif sends out his massive army to take the great fortress that is the gateway to the western world....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OSRRvgAACAAJ&dq=Children+of+the+Earth+and+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"San Francisco Opera: The First Seventy-Five Years","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hdQSzQEACAAJ&dq=San+Francisco+Opera:+The+First+Seventy-Five+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acid Casuals (A Mask Noir Title)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Passtrak Series 6 Investment Company/Variable Contracts Limited Representative : License Exam Manual (edicin en espaol )","description":"Documentation and testimony from Da Corte's 2020 reinvention of a classic 1960s happening In early March 2020, on the cusp of the COVID-19 shutdown, an audience gathered to witness a reinvention of Allan Kaprow's happening, Chicken, by Philadelphia-based artist Alex Da Corte (born 1980). Performed at the site of Kaprow's original--the Gershman Y at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia--Da Corte's first live performance reimagined Kaprow's chaotic event, which had been orchestrated in 1962 under the auspices of the first Pop art exhibition on the East Coast.

Recent Congressional elections fly in the face of those requirements, however, with a startling lack of competition, growing ideological polarization, and a fierce struggle between the parties to manipulate the electoral rules of the game. Party Lines addresses these problems head on in an authoritative and timely analysis of redistricting in the United States. The practice of state legislatures redrawing district lines after the decennial census has long been a controversial aspect of our governing system. Recent developments have added new urgency to earlier debates. The sorry spectacle of mid-decade partisan gerrymandering in Texas renewed public attention to the potential problems of redistricting, reinforcing the view that it is unfairly dominated by self-serving elected officials and parties. The perfunctory character of Congressional elections is another growing problem in 2002, only four House incumbents were defeated in the general election, the lowest in American history. Despite a hotly contested presidential contest in 2004, that number increased by only three. In Pa rty Lines, eminent political analysts explain the legal and political history of redistricting since the one personone vote revolution in the 1960s and place it in the larger context of American politics. The authors document the impact of redistricting on competition, polarization, and partisan fairness, and they assess the role technology played in the redistricting process. The final chapter analyzes options for reform, including most importantly the use of independent redistricting commissions as an alternative to the normal state legislative process. Redistricting reform is no panacea but it is a start toward ensuring that American voters still have the largest say in who will represent them.

In Eat My Words: Reading Women's Lives through the Cookbooks They Wrote, Janet Theophano shows that cookbooks provide food for the mind and the soul as well. Looking beyond the ingredients and instructions, she shows how women have used cookbooks to assert their individuality, develop their minds, and structure their lives. Beginning in the seventeenth century and moving up through the present day, Theophano reads between the lines of recipes for dandelion wine, \\"Queen of Puddings,\\" and half-pound cake to capture the stories and voices of these remarkable women. The selection of books looked at is enticing and wide-ranging. Theophano begins with seventeenth-century English estate housekeeping books that served as both cookbooks and reading primers so that women could educate themselves during long hours in the kitchen. She looks at A Date with a Dish, a classic African American cookbook that reveals the roots of many traditional American dishes, and she brings to life a 1950s cookbook written specifically for Americans by a Chinese  migr  and transcribed into English by her daughter. Finally, Theophano looks at the contemporary cookbooks of Lynne Rosetto Kaspar, Madeleine Kamman, and Alice Waters to illustrate the sophistication and political activism present in modern cookbook writing. Janet Theophano harvests the rich history of cookbook writing to show how much more can be learned from a recipe than how to make a casserole, roast a chicken, or bake a cake. We discover that women's writings about food reveal--and revel in--the details of their lives, families, and the cultures they help to shape.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7wgmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freud's Answer: The Social Origins of Our Psychoanalytic Century","description":"In this stimulating and original book, Martin Wank provides the first coherent view of the roots of Freudian psychoanalysis, showing how Freud and his colleagues were social, political, and economic therapists in the broadest sense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bE99AAAAMAAJ&dq=Freud%27s+Answer:+The+Social+Origins+of+Our+Psychoanalytic+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"D.B.

The simulation part computes the bioimpedance signal with Finite Difference Method. Electrode locations can be specified anywhere in the virtual heart and the FDM computes the complex electrical potential in the whole modelling domain. This method effectively gives the solution to the forward problem of electrical bioimpedance. Sample results of the working system are presented as simulated complex impedance signals at the catheter electrodes with 5 different stroke volumes of the heart and at 2 different frequencies. The results show that magnitude and also phase of the signal correlate with the changing volume of the heart. The impedance of static heart with anisotropic tissue properties was also studied and it uncovered the extent of errors that improper use of anisotropy could introduce.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=--SSZwEACAAJ&dq=Virtual+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Letters for All Occasions","description":"Offers practical, up-to-date advice on how to write several types of personal and professional letters--including cover letters, letters of reference, and thank-you notes--and provides two hundred sample letters.

You won't want to put it down.  --Mary Alice Monroe, New York Times bestselling author of A Lowcountry Wedding In a heartfelt story set in a picturesque small town in Virginia, Mary McDonough portrays three generations of women in a modern Irish-American family as they navigate marriage, motherhood, and independence. . . The Fitzgibbons--especially the women--have long been the backbone of Oliver's Well, Virginia. Matriarch Mary Bernadette is still striking and tireless at seventy-five, with a generous heart that belies her sometimes sharp tongue. Her husband, Paddy, owns the local landscaping business, daughter Grace is a nun, and son Pat and his wife Megan are successful lawyers. Her grandson, PJ, and his new wife, Alexis, live in a charming cottage behind the main house. Church, family, tradition, and the local historical society--everything Mary Bernadette cherishes is here. Yet below the surface, there are fractures. Megan sees the strained relationship between her husband and Mary Bernadette, who has never quite recovered from the loss of her first-born son. Megan, too, is torn between gaining her mother-in-law's approval and living life on her own terms. Alexis loves PJ deeply yet chafes against his grandmother's influence in their marriage. But when a looming scandal brings unexpected tragedy, the Fitzgibbons are compelled to determine the depth of their loyalty, find their strength--and repair the bonds that have held a town, and a family, together for so long. \\"A heartfelt, charming story.\\" --Library Journal","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VgBjBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As the Ward Turns","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ai3ePQAACAAJ&dq=As+the+Ward+Turns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pumpkin Coach","description":"For Alice Pettiford, living near Gloucester in the late 1940s, leaving school for a job as a railway secretary makes perfect sense.

What Alice does not expect is that she would fall in love with Joe Adair, a colleague, almost as soon as she meets him. But Joe has to go overseas on National Service, and in the meanwhile Hester's brother, the enigmatic Valentine, finds that his fondness for Alice is deepening into something much stronger. When he and Alice discover an old railway coach, long abandoned, hidden in a clearing in the Forest of Dean, Alice realises that it has been a very special, magical place. What she doesn't know is that the coach has played a secret part in the history of Joe's family, and that Joe's mother named it 'the pumpkin coach'.

David Levin argues that Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and Fritz Lang's 1920s film Die Nibelungen creatively exploit contrasts between good and bad aesthetics to address the question of what is German and what is not. He shows that each work associates a villainous character, portrayed as non-Germanic and Jewish, with the sometimes dramatically awkward act of narration. For both Wagner and Lang, narration--or, in cinematic terms, visual presentation--possesses a typically Jewish potential for manipulation and control. Consistent with this view, Levin shows, the Germanic hero Siegfried is killed in each work by virtue of his unwitting adoption of a narrative role. Levin begins with an explanation of the book's theoretical foundations and then applies these theories to close readings of, in turn, Wagner's cycle and Lang's film. He concludes by tracing how Germans have dealt with the Nibelungen myths in the wake of the Second World War, paying special attention to Michael Verhoeven's 1989 film The Nasty Girl. His fresh and interdisciplinary approach sheds new light not only on Wagner's Ring and Lang's Die Nibelungen, but also on the ways in which aesthetics can be put to the service of aggression and hatred. The book is an important contribution to scholarship in film and music and also to the broader study of German culture and national identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vtEqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aphrodite (Ancient Manners)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7YxVAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arya Samaj As a Fundamentalist Movement: A Study In Comparative Fundamentalism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FywKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Arya+Samaj+As+a+Fundamentalist+Movement:+A+Study+In+Comparative+Fundamentalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forever, Erma: Best-Loved Writing from America's Favorite Humorist","description":"New York Times Bestseller: This anthology of Erma Bombeck s most memorable and humorous essays is a tribute to one of America s sharpest wits. When she began writing her regular newspaper column in 1965, Erma Bombeck s goal was to make housewives laugh. Thirty years later, she had published more than four thousand columns, and earned countless laughs from housewives, presidents, and everyone in between. With grace, good humor, and razor-sharp prose, she gently skewered every aspect of the American family. This collection holds the best of her columns not just her famous quips, but also the heartbreaking observations that gave her writing such weight. In 1969, Erma wrote:  screaming kids, unpaid bills, green leftovers, husbands behind newspapers, basketballs in the bathroom. They re real . . . they re warm . . . they re the only bit of normalcy left in this cockeyed world, and I m going to cling to it like life itself.

It offers resources to providers and institutions committed to delivering culturally responsive health care, paying special attention to building successful relationships with traditional Hmong patients and families. It makes available extensive information about the health-related beliefs, practices, and values of the Hmong people, including photographs of traditional healing methods. Ranging in age from young infants to older adults, the patients in the stories present a wide range of health problems. The clinicians are from family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry/psychology, and hospice. Each of the fourteen case stories is accompanied by discussion questions as well as two or three commentaries. The commentaries--written by patients, family members, shaman, Western clinicians (including Hmong physicians, nurses, and social workers), medical anthropologists, health care ethicists, social workers, psychologists, and clergy--are rich in personal reflections on cross-cultural health care experiences. Readers are rewarded with a combination of perspectives, including those of Hmong authors who have not previously published in English and scholars with years of professional experience working with the Hmong in Laos, Thailand, and the United States. The editors offer a model for delivering culturally responsive health care with special attention to matters of cross-cultural health care ethics. The model identifies questions health care providers can focus on as they seek to understand the health-related moral commitments and practices prevalent in the cultural groups they serve, ethical questions that arise frequently and with great poignancy in cross-cultural health care relationships, and points to consider when a patient's treatment wish challenges the provider's professional integrity. By sharing stories of suffering, confusion, and success, Healing by Heart couples an accessible method of learning about others with concrete recommendations about how to enhance cross-cultural health care relationships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eTEfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Healing+by+Heart:+Clinical+and+Ethical+Case+Stories+of+Hmong+Families+and+Western+Providers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson","description":"Memoir.

Anne Noggle, now a photographer and author based in Albuquerque, has captured the spirit of these dynamic aviation pioneers in her photographic book For God, Country, and the Thrill of It. In 1943-44 Noggle was a WASP--a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots group, the country's first women military pilots. She and her colleagues disproved assertions that women would be too emotional or high-strung to fly military aircraft. They flew every type of plane in use at the time, initially ferrying aircraft wherever they were needed and later serving as test pilots and \\"enemy\\" in training maneuvers for male combat flyers. Earning $50 a month less than male counterparts in noncombatant roles, WASPs were called on several times to test planes, such as the P-39, that male flyers had declared \\"flying coffins.\\" The women flyers had better records and adhered to flight regulations, and after their test flights the military declared that the planes were indeed safe to fly--if flown properly. Still, thirty-eight WASPs did lose their lives on active duty. Not until 1979, however, did Congress affirm that these women had been in active military service and were thus eligible for veterans' benefits. Women Airforce Service Pilots had been abruptly dismissed in December 1944, when it was decided that they were no longer needed. Since 1944 Anne Noggle has been a flight instructor, a crop duster, and an air show pilot. More recently she has turned her considerable energy and enthusiasm toward photography and serves on the arts faculty at the University of New Mexico. It was at the 1986 WASP reunion at their old training ground on the flat prairies of Sweetwater, Texas, that Anne Noggle made the stunning photographs of these military pioneers. The Chicago Tribune reported that \\"the portraits, taken against a neutral background that focuses attention on the women themselves, are the heart of the book. . . . Pride and confidence are hallmarks of these pictures. Some women wear their uniforms and the rest wear every manner of civilian dress. But all of them wear their wings and their age with the distinct bearing of people who challenged their own strength of character and won.\\" The WASP portraits have been exhibited across the country. Ms. Noggle's interest in photography on women's experiences in the military took her to Moscow three times, even as the Soviet Union dissolved. Her forthcoming book, A Dance with Death (fall 1994), presents the stories of the Soviet Union's female combat pilots in World War II, along with historic photographs and contemporary portraits by Noggle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=weNOAAAAMAAJ&dq=For+God,+Country,+and+the+Thrill+of+It:+Women+Airforce+Service+Pilots+in+World+War+II+(Charles+and+Elizabeth+Prothro+Texas+Photography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Apostolic Fathers: Modern Translations of These Early Christian Writings: Barnabas / I & II Clement / The Didache / Hermas / Ignatius / Polycarp","description":"The writings in this volume cast a glimmer of light upon the emerging traditions and organization of the infant church, during an otherwise little-known period of its development. A selection of letters and small-scale theological treatises from a group known as the Apostolic Fathers, several of whom were probably disciples of the Apostles, they provide a first-hand account of the early Church and outline a form of early Christianity still drawing on the theology and traditions of its parent religion, Judaism. Included here are the first Epistle of Bishop Clement of Rome, an impassioned plea for harmony; The Epistle of Polycarp; The Epistle of Barnabas; The Didache; and the Seven Epistles written by Ignatius of Antioch among them his moving appeal to the Romans that they grant him a martyr's death.

Finally here is a book that is both a natural history of this beautiful region and an excellent guide to its extensive public lands. The first section introduces the area's geology, climate, flora, fauna, and human history. The second section describes selected sites, trails, and features that are mentioned in Part One. Although Big Sur is world famous for awe-inspiring scenery, it is less known for its great ecological diversity and its significance as a haven for many species of terrestrial and marine wildlife. In no other part of the world do fog-loving coastal redwoods thrive on one slope of a canyon while arid-climate yuccas grow on the other. Similarly, sea otters and cormorants live near dry-climate creatures like canyon wrens and whiptail lizards. The area's staggering beauty and forbidding wilderness have inspired artists, poets, naturalists, and hikers and also real estate developers. As increasing tourism, development pressure, and land-use decisions continue to affect Big Sur, this book will do much to heighten awareness of the region's biotic richness and fragility. Written in nontechnical language, with generous color photographs, drawings, maps, species lists, and a bibliography, it will attract both the casual and the serious naturalist, as well as anyone concerned about preserving California's natural heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7iqPlVKxdSQC&dq=Big+Sur+:+A+Complete+History+and+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sz","description":"Annotation. \\"The rise of the Great Powers and the course of world civilizations, their formative wars and diplomatic, political and economic relations, are the primary focus.

At more than 3 million in number, nurses make up the single largest segment of the health care work force. They also spend the greatest amount of time in delivering patient care as a profession. Nurses therefore have valuable insights and unique abilities to contribute as partners with other health care professionals in improving the quality and safety of care as envisioned in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted this year. Nurses should be fully engaged with other health professionals and assume leadership roles in redesigning care in the United States. To ensure its members are well-prepared, the profession should institute residency training for nurses, increase the percentage of nurses who attain a bachelor's degree to 80 percent by 2020, and double the number who pursue doctorates. Furthermore, regulatory and institutional obstacles -- including limits on nurses' scope of practice -- should be removed so that the health system can reap the full benefit of nurses' training, skills, and knowledge in patient care. In this book, the Institute of Medicine makes recommendations for an action-oriented blueprint for the future of nursing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Q1eS4vz3cMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Erewhon;: Or, Over the range","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book I (2nd Edition)","description":"The Fifth edition of the best-selling communicatively based text for beginning Russian is enhanced by a greater focus on contemporary culture and simplified, visual grammar explanations that will better engage your students.

How do words and mental pictures come to represent things in the world? Do computers think, and if so, are their thought processes significantly similar to our thought processes? Or is there something distinctive about human thought that precludes replication in a computer? These are some of the puzzles that motivate the philosophical discipline called ?philosophy of mind,? a central area of philosophy. This Very Short Introduction introduces the philosophy of mind, and looks at some of the most interesting and important topics in this fascinating field, including the mind-body problem and dualism. Barbara Montero also discusses minds other than our own, and the problems associated with defining consciousness in animals, aliens and machines. Considering these and other such thorny issues such as physicalism and intentionality, she demonstrates how questions of the philosophy of mind also infiltrate disciplines outside of philosophy, including psychology, neuroscience, economics, evolutionary biology, and linguistics. As she observes, almost everyone, at some time or another, has ruminated over the relation between mind and matter.

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash MX Audio Magic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Australia's Underwater Wilderness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Desktop Publishing with PageMaker 6.5","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AcN5zgEACAAJ&dq=Desktop+Publishing+with+PageMaker+6.5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Augustan Aristocracy","description":"While the monarchy established by Caesar Augustus attracts assiduous study, not enough has been said about the old nobility renascent after years of civil war.

The exposition has to range backward to the closing age of the Republic and forward to Nero's death. In fact, the best testimony to the Augustan aristocracy derives from the Annals of Tacitus. After splendour and success, evident notably in the second decade ofthe reign (on which this book is centred), the ancient houses went down in the embrace of the dynasty, itself from the outset an aristocratic nexus.

With a cast of characters that includes friars, soldiers, civilians, a Spanish governor, and a diverse native population, the book portrays the dwellings, daily life, religious practices, social structures, and recreation activities at the mission. From their prehistoric ancestors and first contact with Europeans in the 1500s to their dispersal following attacks by the English and by their Native American allies in the early 1700s, the Apalachee played important roles in the history of Florida and of native peoples throughout the Southeast. The San Luis community near Tallahassee, the most thoroughly investigated mission in Florida, served as Spain's provincial capital in America. From 1656 to its conquest by the English, it flourished as the only significant Spanish settlement in Florida outside of St. Augustine. Written by the two foremost authorities on the Florida Apalachee, this full-color volume offers general readers a compelling combination of archaeology and history. John H. Hann is a research historian at the San Luis Archaeological and Historic Site and a leading scholar on the missions of Spanish Florida. He is the author of Apalachee: The Land Between the Rivers (UPF, 1988), Missions to the Calusa (UPF, 1991), and History of the Timucua Indians and Missions (UPF, 1996). Bonnie G. McEwan, director of archaeology at the San Luis site in Tallahassee, has conducted research in the Southeast, California, Spain, and the Caribbean. She is the editor of The Spanish Missions of La Florida (UPF, 1993).

Writing in a great variety of musical forms--symphonies, concertos, operas, vocal music, and chamber music--he infused his works with poetic lyricism and gave tonal language and forms new vitality. His rich legacy includes such famous compositions as the Adagio for Strings, the orchestral song Knoxville: Summer of 1915, three concertos, and his two operas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Vanessa and Antony and Cleopatra, a commissioned work that opened the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Generously documented by letters, sketchbooks, original musical manuscripts, and interviews with friends, colleagues and performers with whom he worked, this is the first book to cover Barber's entire career and all of his compositions. The biographical material on Barber is closely interspersed with a discussion of his music, displaying Barber's creative processes at work from his early student compositions to his mature masterpieces. Heyman also provides the social context in which this major composer grew: his education, how he built his career, the evolving musical tastes of American audiences, his relationship to musical giants like Serge Koussevitzky, and the role of radio in the promotion of his music. A testament to the significance of the new Romanticism, Samuel Barber stands as a model biography of an important American musical figure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u6QGtHHtr6MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mobilizing Invisible Assets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kLYXVMLUCAAC&dq=Mobilizing+Invisible+Assets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Croatia","description":"Lonely Planet's Croatia is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Like a thief in the night had they come, and for no better reason than that the Captain had been unanimously voted a shade too shady to associate with self-respecting spirits had they made off with the happy floating club-house of their betters; and worst of all, with them, by force of circumstances over which they had no control, had sailed also the fair Queen Elizabeth, the spirited Xanthippe, and every other strong-minded and beautiful woman of Erebean society, whereby the men thereof were rendered desolate. \\"I can't stand it!\\" cried Raleigh, desperately, as with his accustomed grace he presided over a special meeting of the club, called on the bank of the inky Stygian stream, at the point where the missing boat had been moored. \\"Think of it, gentlemen, Elizabeth of England, Calpurnia of Rome, Ophelia of Denmark, and every precious jewel in our social diadem gone, vanished completely; and with whom? Kidd, of all men in the universe! Kidd, the pirate, the ruffian \\" \\"Don't take on so, my dear Sir Walter,\\" said Socrates, cheerfully. \\"What's the use of going into hysterics? You are not a woman, and should eschew that luxury. Xanthippe is with them, and I'll warrant you that when that cherished spouse of mine has recovered from the effects of the sea, say the third day out, Kidd and his crew will be walking the plank, and voluntarily at that.\\" \\"But the House-boat itself,\\" murmured Noah, sadly. \\"That was my delight. It reminded me in some respects of the Ark.\\" \\"The law of compensation enters in there, my dear Commodore,\\" retorted Socrates. \\"For me, with Xanthippe abroad I do not need a club to go to; I can stay at home and take my hemlock in peace and straight. Xanthippe always compelled me to dilute it at the rate of one quart of water to the finger.\\" \\"Well, we didn't all marry Xanthippe,\\" put in Caesar firmly, \\"therefore we are not all satisfied with the situation. I, for one, quite agree with Sir Walter that something must be done, and quickly. Are we to sit here and do nothing, allowing that fiend to kidnap our wives with impunity?\\" \\"Not at all,\\" interposed Bonaparte. \\"The time for action has arrived. All things considered, he is welcome to Marie Louise, but the idea of Josephine going off on a cruise of that kind breaks my heart.\\" \\"No question about it,\\" observed Dr. Johnson. \\"We've got to do something if it is only for the sake of appearances. The question really is, what shall be done first?\\" \\"I am in favor of taking a drink as the first step, and considering the matter of further action afterwards,\\" suggested Shakespeare, and it was this suggestion that made the members unanimous upon the necessity for immediate action, for when the assembled spirits called for their various favorite beverages it was found that there were none to be had, it being Sunday, and all the establishments wherein liquid refreshments were licensed to be sold being closed for at the time of writing the local government of Hades was in the hands of the reform party. \\"What!\\" cried Socrates. \\"Nothing but Styx water and vitriol, Sundays? Then the House-boat must be recovered whether Xanthippe comes with it or not. Sir Walter, I am for immediate action, after all. This ruffian should be captured at once and made an example of.\\" \\"Excuse me, Socrates,\\" put in Lindley Murray, \\"but, ah pray speak in Greek hereafter, will you, please? When you attempt English you have a beastly way of working up to climatic prepositions which are offensive to the ear of a purist.\\" \\"This is no time to discuss style, Murray,\\" interposed Sir Walter. \\"Socrates may speak and spell like Chaucer if he pleases; he may even part his infinitives in the middle, for all I care. We have affairs of greater moment in hand.\\" \\"We must ransack the earth,\\" cried Socrates, \\"until we find that boat. I'm dry as a fish.\\" \\"There he goes again!\\" growled Murray. \\"Dry as a fish!

The Gospel of the Holy Spirit: Mediation and Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles is a scholarly, yet immensely accessible, study of the Acts of the Apostles. It highlights the deep theological and spiritual meaning of Acts and shows the vibrant life of the early Church and its leaders, on fire with love for Christ.

Drawing on the special relationship that the Native people of southeastern Alaska have always had with nature, Blonde Indian is a story about returning. Told in eloquent layers that blend Native stories and metaphor with social and spiritual journeys, this enchanting memoir traces the author s life from her difficult childhood growing up in the Tlingit community, through her adulthood, during which she lived for some time in Seattle and San Francisco, and eventually to her return home. Neither fully Native American nor Euro-American, Hayes encounters a unique sense of alienation from both her Native community and the dominant culture. We witness her struggles alongside other Tlingit men and women many of whom never left their Native community but wrestle with their own challenges, including unemployment, prejudice, alcoholism, and poverty. The author s personal journey, the symbolic stories of contemporary Natives, and the tales and legends that have circulated among the Tlingit people for centuries are all woven together, making Blonde Indian much more than the story of one woman s life. Filled with anecdotes, descriptions, and histories that are unique to the Tlingit community, this book is a document of cultural heritage, a tribute to the Alaskan landscape, and a moving testament to how going back in nature and in life allows movement forward.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hKlKCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lee Marvin: His Films and Career","description":"Lee Marvin did not receive his first starring film role until he was 40, but in three short years following the successes of Cat Ballou (for which he won the Academy Award as Best Actor), The Professionals and especially The Dirty Dozen he was the most popular film actor in America.

Charms and beseechings, hexes and potions, all have a place in the lives of the people of this world. Dowsers find water, the second sight warns of dangers to come, and a torch can read a person's future---or their heart. In this world where \\"knacks\\" abound, Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a very special man indeed. He's a Maker; he has the knack of understanding how things are put together, how to create them, repair them, keep them whole, or tear them down. He can heal hearts as well as bones, he build a house, he can calm the waters or blow up a storm. And he can teach his knack to others, to the measure of their own talent. Alvin has been trying to avert the terrible war that his wife, Peggy, a torch of extraordinary power, has seen down the life-lines of every American. Now she has sent him down the Mizzippy to the city of New Orleans, or Nueva Barcelona as they call it under Spanish occupation. Alvin doesn't know exactly why he's there, but when he and his brother-in-law, Arthur Stuart, find lodgings with a family of abolitionists who know Peggy, he suspects he'll find out soon. But Nueva Barcelona is about to experience a plague, and Alvin's efforts to protect his friends by keeping them healthy will create more danger than he could ever have suspected. And in saving the poor people of the city, Alvin will be put to the greatest test of his life---a test that will draw on all his power. For the time has come for him to turn to his old friend Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet who controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy.

But what about inequality between all citizens of the world? Worlds Apart addresses just how to measure global inequality among individuals, and shows that inequality is shaped by complex forces often working in different directions. Branko Milanovic, a top World Bank economist, analyzes income distribution worldwide using, for the first time, household survey data from more than 100 countries. He evenhandedly explains the main approaches to the problem, offers a more accurate way of measuring inequality among individuals, and discusses the relevant policies of first-world countries and nongovernmental organizations. Inequality has increased between nations over the last half century (richer countries have generally grown faster than poorer countries). And yet the two most populous nations, China and India, have also grown fast. But over the past two decades inequality within countries has increased. As complex as reconciling these three data trends may be, it is clear: the inequality between the world's individuals is staggering. At the turn of the twenty-first century, the richest 5 percent of people receive one-third of total global income, as much as the poorest 80 percent. While a few poor countries are catching up with the rich world, the differences between the richest and poorest individuals around the globe are huge and likely growing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3GMsOhe-xGIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Missing Links","description":"When a group of middle-class buddies obsessed with golf set up a bet to see who can finagle their way onto the nearby private course, their friendship is tested in ways they had never expected in this humorous novel from Rick Reilly, one of America s most popular sportswriters. Missing Links is the story of four middle class buddies who live outside of Boston and for years have been 1) utterly obsessed with golf and 2) a regular foursome at Ponkaquoque Municipal Course and Deli, not so fondly known as Ponky, the single worst golf course in America. Just adjacent to these municipal links lies the Mayflower Country Club, the most exclusive private course in all of Boston and a major needle in their collective sides. Frustrated by the Mayflower's finely manicured greens and snooty members, three of Ponky's finest and most courageous Two Down, Dannie, and Stick set up a bet: $1,000.00 apiece, and the first man to somehow finagle his way on to the Mayflower course takes all. Lying, cheating, and forgery are encouraged, to put it mildly, and with the constant heckling and rare aid of Chunkin' Charlie, Hoover, and Bluto--a few more of Ponky's elite--the games begin. One of the three will eventually play the Mayflower's course, but their friendships--and everything else--will change as various truths unravel and the old Ponky starts looking like the home they never should have left.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zDUXSWgy-YIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Different Kind of Man (Harlequin Superromance #1319)","description":"Emalea LeBlanc is a different kind of woman.

One is \\"America's game,\\" while the other is \\"the world's game.\\" Baseball and soccer are both beloved cultural institutions. What draws fans to one game is often a mystery to fans of the other. Despite superficial differences, however, the business and culture of these sports share more in common than meets the eye. This is the first in-depth, cross-cultural comparison of these two great pastimes and the megabusinesses that they have become. In N ational Pastime, Stefan Szymanski and Andrew Zimbalist illustrate how the different traditions of each sport have generated different possibilities for their commercial organization and exploitation. They pay special attention to the rich and complex evolution of baseball from its beginnings in America, and they trace modern soccer from its foundation in England through its subsequent expansion across the world. They illustrate how Victorian administrators laid the foundation for Major League Baseball (MLB) and soccer leagues such as the English Premier League, Italy's Serie A, and the European Champions League. The authors show how the organizers of baseball and soccer have learned from each other in the past and how they can continue to do so. Both sports are rich in tradition. In some cases, however, these traditions often arbitrary rules established by long-defunct administrators have obstructed the healthy development of the sport. By studying the experiences of other sports, it might be possible to develop new and better ways to operate. For example, soccer might benefit from greater cooperation among teams as in baseball. On the other hand, MLB could learn from soccer's relegation rules and more open system of ownership, thus avoiding some of the excesses (competitive imbalance, uneven team resources) associated with monopoly. Nat ional Pastime does not advocate the jettisoning of all tradition to adopt wholesale the approach of another sport, of course. In an era of globalization, where business interests are increasingly looking to transplant organizational ideas in order to maximize profits, the authors argue that fan-friendly reforms may be necessary in order to avoid something worse. Ultimately, they propose no simple solutions, instead suggesting specific reforms to the organization of baseball and soccer, drawing on each other's experiences. Lively and accessibly written, this book is essential reading for business analysts, journalists, policymakers, and managers of both sports. Most of all, however, it will appeal to baseball and soccer aficionados, whether they root for the New York Yankees, Manchester United, or Real Madrid.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9XzfPqTH7kcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Employee Orientation Training (Pergamon Flexible Learning Trainer's Workshop Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Prayer That Avail Much For Grandparents: James 5:16 (Prayers That Avail Much (Paperback))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Build It Up: An Advanced Course in Esl/Efl Reading Comprehension","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xELjOAAACAAJ&dq=Build+It+Up:+An+Advanced+Course+in+Esl/Efl+Reading+Comprehension&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Prospect Before Her: A History of Women in Western Europe 1500-1800","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ethics of Giving and Receiving: Am I My Foolish Brother's Keeper?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Whispers in the Attic: Living with the Dead","description":"Explores the history and folklore surrounding ghosts and offers case studies and personal experiences featuring different types of ghosts and possible explanations for their sighting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ym3TYHs6XnsC&dq=Whispers+in+the+Attic:+Living+with+the+Dead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Acne Rosacea: A Revised and Updated Directory for the Internet Age","description":"Three volumes collect 750 entries that provide information on the impact of cancer on different countries, along with the causes and strategies for prevention around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nbQ5DQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Official+Patient%27s+Sourcebook+on+Acne+Rosacea:+A+Revised+and+Updated+Directory+for+the+Internet+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Condemned: Death Row Inmates in Their Own Words","description":"With virtually every poll in America citing crime as one of the public's biggest concerns, in late 1994 and early 1995, the Dallas Morning News sent a questionnaire to every man and woman in the country on Death Row, asking some 75 questions about their crimes, their experiences, their attitudes, etc. The survey was drafted by the News with input from a veteran capital murder prosecutor, a Death Row appeals lawyer, a criminologist, a forensic psychiatrist, a Death Row warden and a former Death Row inmate.

The book illustrates that almost everywhere, mountains arose by vertical uplift of a former plain, and by a mixture of cracking and warping by earth movements, and erosion by rivers and glaciers, the present mountainous landscapes were created. It also gives evidence that this uplift only occured in the last few million years, a time scale which does not fit the plate tectonics theory. Another fascinating part of the evidence, shows that mountain uplift correlates very well with climatic change. Mountain building could have been responsible for the onset of the ice age. It certainly resulted in the creation of new environments. Fossil plants and animals are used in places to work out the time of mountain uplift, which in turn helps to explain biogeographical distributions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PdiFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shield - America's 1st Patriotic Comic Book Hero (The Red Circle Series)","description":"Journey back to the Golden Age of comics - a period that defined and shaped the course of comic books for years to come!

As a disenchanted, unemployed English professor, Thad Ziolkowski decides one day to sneak away from his temp job in Manhattan and catch a wave off a dingy Queens shoreline. In the meager cold waves, he contemplates how he could have possibly become a semidepressed, chain-smoking, aimless man when, for a few shining years of his boyhood, he was invincible. His lapsed love affair with the ocean begins amid the late-sixties counterculture in coastal Florida. After his parents  divorce, nine-year-old Thad escapes from his difficult family notably a new brooding and explosive stepfather by heading for the thrilling, uncharted waters of the local beach. In the embrace of the surf, he is able to stay offshore for years, until his life is upended once again, this time by a double tragedy that deposits him at a crossroads between a life in the waves and a life on land.

Sherman contended with Joseph E. Johnston and his successor, John Bell Hood, and moved steadily through Georgia to occupy the rail and commercial center of Atlanta. Sherman's efforts were undertaken as his former commander, Ulysses S. Grant, set out on a similar mission to destroy Robert E. Lee or drive him back to Richmond. These struggles were the millstones that Grant intended to use to grind the Confederacy's strength into dust. By fall, Sherman's success in Georgia had assured the re-election of Abraham Lincoln and determined that the federal government would never acquiesce in the independence of the Confederacy. Richard M. McMurry examines the Atlanta campaign as a political and military unity in the context of the greater struggle of the war itself. Richard M.

While we were waiting for the Internet to make us rich back when we thought all we had to do was to buy lottery tickets called dotcom shares we missed the real story of the information economy. That story, says Bruce Abramson in Digital Phoenix, took place at the intersection of technology, law, and economics. It unfolded through Microsoft's manipulation of software markets, through open source projects like Linux, and through the file-sharing adventures that Napster enabled. Linux and Napster in particular exploited newly enabled business models to make information sharing cheap and easy; both systems met strong opposition from entrenched interests intent on preserving their own profits. These scenarios set the stage for the future of the information economy, a future in which each new technology will threaten powerful incumbents who will, in turn, fight to retard this \\"dangerous new direction\\" of progress. Disentangling the technological, legal, and economic threads of the story, Abramson argues that the key to the entire information economy understanding the past and preparing for the future lies in our approach to intellectual property and idea markets. The critical challenge of the information age, he says, is to motivate the creation and dissemination of ideas. After discussing relevant issues in intellectual property and antitrust law, the economics of competition, and artificial intelligence and software engineering, Abramson tells the information economy's formative histories: the Microsoft antitrust trial, the open-source movement, and (in a chapter called \\"The Computer Ate My Industry\\") the advent of digital music. Finally, he looks toward the future, examining some ways that intellectual property reform could power economic growth and showing how the information economy will reshape the ways we think about business, employment, society, and public policy how the information economy, in fact, can make us all rich, as consumers and producers, if not as investors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HmyqbzrlVpkC&dq=Digital+Phoenix:+Why+the+Information+Economy+Collapsed+and+How+It+Will+Rise+Again&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy: What It Is, With All the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics & Several Cures It; In Three Partitions with Their Several Sections, Members & Subsections Philosophically, Medicinally, HIstorically Opened & Cut Up","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k-caAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The System: An Insider's Life in Soviet Politics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Foxfire 10","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Elton John Piano Solo Collection","description":"(Piano Solo Personality). 22 songs from this pop piano master, including: Bennie and the Jets * Can You Feel the Love Tonight * Candle in the Wind * Daniel * I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues * Rocket Man * Sacrifice * Your Song * and more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xe_LAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Search Engine Placement and Ranking","description":"Finally!

War surprised, devastated, and opened up imagination, taking hold of Americans' words as well as their homes and families. The personal diary wildly ragged yet rooted in day following day was one place Americans wrote their war. Diaries, then, have become one of the best-known, most-used sources for exploring the life of the mind in a war-torn place and time. Delving into several familiar wartime diaries kept by women of the southern slave-owning class, Steven Stowe recaptures their motivations to keep the days close even as war tore apart the brutal system of slavery that had benefited them. Whether the diarists recorded thoughts about themselves, their opinions about men, or their observations about slavery, race, and warfare, Stowe shows how these women, by writing the immediate moment, found meaning in a changing world. In studying the inner lives of these unsympathetic characters, Stowe also explores the importance and the limits of historical empathy as a condition for knowing the past, demonstrating how these plain, first-draft texts can offer new ways to make sense of the world in which these Confederate women lived.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8dNTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The War Above the Trees","description":"The war as seen through the eyes of a helicopter crew member.

But, there are answers to some of these and other intriguing, and sometimes troubling, questions about life inside this book in easy-to-understand language. This book is designed to lessen some of the mystery of God. God wants us to know more about Him and His plans for us. God wants us to know about His Son, Christ Jesus, and exactly what He did for us then and what He does for us now. God wants us to know about His power, the Holy Spirit, and what He does. God wants us to understand how we are viewed by Him and how we fit into His overall plans. He wants us to see ourselves, the condition that we have, and the position that we are in. God wants us to understand that there must be a faithful and productive relationship between Him and us if we are to please Him. And we must have a solid understanding of how that relationship itself works. It is extremely important that we know what sin is and how it affects our relationship with Him. He wants and expects us to know all these things. God has never wanted to remain a total mystery to us because we cannot serve Him if He is a total mystery. Therefore, this book explains to the undecided, enlightens the newly converted, and reinforces for those already \\"born again\\" the necessity of understanding the relationship between God and themselves. Also, you will come to know that there are choices that must be made that only you can make. But they will not be as difficult to make once you have a better understanding of the relationship between God and man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HHlsX-i5_fUC&dq=Trinity+of+man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancestral Trails.

He remains among the few most important interpreters to the West of all aspects of Japanese life and thought. Hearn came to America at 19 and, despite poverty and hardship, nevertheless gained a reputation as an able journalist. He had published three books and was well on the road to achieving lasting fame as a writer in the West but found a new and happier existence when he went to Japan. There he married a Japanese lady who bore him three children, and was able to gain a livelihood by teaching at the universities. He labored persistently, until his premature death in 1904, to understand all the facets of the country and the nation. His descriptions of his travels and contacts with the Japanese people, together with his profound study of Shintoism and Buddhism, established him as one of the great writers of his time. Hearn came to live in Japan permanently at the moment when the government and the upper classes began quite frenziedly to transform Japan into a Westernized, industrial society. Hearn had little faith in this process and foresaw the evils it would bring. He and a few like-minded friends played an extraordinarily significant role in persuading Japanese officials to preserve parts of Japan's priceless artistic and religious heritage which, under the new dispensation, had been left to rot in abandoned temples and monasteries. The chapters of this book are taken from several of the sixteen volumes of Hearn's collected works. They provide perhaps his most enduring writings on Shinto and Buddhism. When Hearn deals with Buddhism he does not concern himself with the different sects but dwells, instead, upon the broad teaching common to all varieties of Buddhism and explains how the Culture of Japan has absorbed it and recreated it in a form native to the land. Hearn was a bold pioneer in his explanation of the historical evolution of Shintoism at a time when Japanese scholars hesitated to treat the subject objectively. It was the national religion and its myths established the divine origin and rise of the Japanese Empire. It was therefore an act of intellectual courage for Hearn to show that Shintoism was a primitive religious development; he also broke new ground when he explained the way in which primitive Shinto had developed and fused with Buddhism in the Middle Ages. Nor did his love for Japan obscure his clear vision of the uses of Shinto mythology for the preparation of totalitarianism and militarism. Hearn's writings, translated into Japanese, remain a vital and important part of Japanese culture. Numerous books and a great deal of newspaper and periodical literature about him were published recently in Japan on the occasion of the centennial. For Hearn's writings succeeded in saving for future Japanese generations much of its cultural and religious heritage. Perhaps the most difficult and complex aspect of Japanese culture are its religions; in this sphere, Hearn achieves the signal feat of being able to explain their religions successfully both to the West and to the Japanese who came after him.\\"--Dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=06rXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Japan%27s+Religions:+Shinto+and+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pedernales country cookbook","description":"Presents recipes with a Texas flavor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eS3EPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Pedernales+country+cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","description":"Presents a comprehensive study that examines how the layman can take a more active role in the church by understanding the basic aspects of theology and its importance in today's world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2u7i62R4SfAC&dq=Theology+and+Sanity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Out about Everyday Things (Explainers Series)","description":"Have you ever tried to learn more about some incredible thing, only to be frustrated by incomprehensible jargon?

Jesus used things like a lily, sparrow, and sheep to teach about the kingdom of God. And in the Old Testament, God repeatedly describes himself and his saving work in relation to physical things such as a rock, horn, or eagle. In God of All Things, pastor and author Andrew Wilson invites you to rediscover God in this way, too--through ordinary, everyday things. He explores the idea of a material world and presents a variety of created marvels that reveal the gospel in everyday life and fuel worship and joy in God--marvels like: Dust: the image of God Horns: the salvation of God Donkeys: the peace of God Water: the life of God Viruses: the problem of God Cities: the kingdom of God God of All Things will leave you with a deeper understanding of Scripture, the world you live in, and the God who made it all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HdTtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Well","description":"Covers all elements of effective and grammatically-correct writing, including electronic formats, for any type of situation from research papers to business memos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2xV1Ah1xSrsC&dq=The+Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide+to+Writing+Well&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North Carolina Atlas & Gazetteer (State Atlas & Gazetteer)","description":"Maps and essays trace the historical evolution of the state's geography, population, and economy, and present modern road systems and current statistical data on crime, education, politics, quality of life, and health care.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XfQYAQAAMAAJ&dq=North+Carolina+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Business of the Internet","description":"An objective look at what Internet commerce can offer both the consumer and the provider.

In racing, the need is for speed, and invention and innovation are the keys to going faster and beating the competition. Nowhere is this more true than at the Indianapolis 500. From the start, Indy has been a hotbed of racing innovation. The early years saw the advancement of engine and chassis design, culminating in Harry Miller's cars and engines that dominated the '20s. In the '30s, the Great Depression hit racing budgets hard; Indy produced the \\"Junk Formula\\", and racers responded with a dizzying array of low-buck, home-brew entries. The '40s and '50s saw the rise of the Offy-powered Indy roadsters, but iconoclasts still brought Novis, diesels, sixwheelers, and other oddities to America's greatest race to try their hand. Then in the '60s, all hell broke loose, with one revolution after another racing around the 2.5-mile Brickyard. In this book, Alex Gabbard covers the history of innovation and racing experimentation at the Indy 500, from the Miller era through the Junk Formula and the Roadster era, then gives you a year-by-year account of Indy's wildest decade ever, the 1960s. The transition to rear-engine cars, followed by Ford's stock-block V-8 challengers, turbo versions of both Fords and Offys, STP's turbine cars, DOHC Fords, wider tires, engineers, aerodynamics - all combined to produce some incredible racing that changed the face of Indy forever. Profusely illustrated with more than 300 photos (nearly half of them in color), this book is sure to become a classic among Indy racing fans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=25IHAAAACAAJ&dq=INDY%27s+Wildest+Decade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"RAW VEGETABLE JUICES","description":"Whats missing on your bookshelf?
