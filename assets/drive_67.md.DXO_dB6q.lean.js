Sometimes, though, you just have to put up with a little more crap.\\" --Michael J. Fox In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease--a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's. Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, he recounts his life--from his childhood in a small town in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television which made him a worldwide celebrity. Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which--with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends--he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He is a very lucky man, indeed. The Michael J. Fox Foundation Michael J. Fox is donating the profits from his book to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is dedicated to fast-forwarding the cure for Parkinson's disease. The Foundation will move aggressively to identify the most promising research and raise the funds to assure that a cure is found for the millions of people living with this disorder. The Foundation's web site, MichaelJFox.org, carries the latest pertinent information about Parkinson's disease, including: A detailed description of Parkinson's disease How you can help find the cure Public Services Announcements that are aired on network and cable television stations across the country to increase awareness Upcoming related Parkinson's disease events and meetings Updates on recent research and developments","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FYmZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PROVERBS.","description":"A reasonably priced, quality black hardcover pew and ministry Bible featuring a large 12-point font.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rbQ4MAEACAAJ&dq=PROVERBS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry Clay: The Great Compromiser (Our People)","description":"Discusses the life and career of the American statesman who, through political compromise, kept the Union together during the early nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dYEFAAAACAAJ&dq=Henry+Clay:+The+Great+Compromiser+(Our+People)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard Handbook of Engineering Calculations","description":"Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.

While Baptists in the antebellum South boasted a different theological pedigree than Presbyterians or Congregationalists, and while they inhabited a Southern landscape unfamiliar to the bustling cities and tall forests of New England, they believed their similarities with Edwards far outweighed their differences. Like Edwards, these Baptists were revivalistic, Calvinistic, loosely confessional, and committed to practical divinity. In these four things, Southern Edwardseanism lived, moved, and had its being. In the nineteenth-century, when so many Presbyterians scoffed at Edwards's \\"innovation\\" and Methodists scorned his Calvinism, Baptists found in Edwards a man after their own heart. By 1845, at the first Southern Baptist Convention, Southern Edwardseans had laid the groundwork for a convention marked by the theology of Jonathan Edwards.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I1lZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roots in the African Dust: Sustaining the Sub-Saharan Drylands","description":"A revisionist study of dryland Africa which synthesises much of the best work of past years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wh_yzCcw8E4C&dq=Roots+in+the+African+Dust:+Sustaining+the+Sub-Saharan+Drylands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anger Management for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients (DHHS Publication No. (SMA) 02-3662)","description":"The last several years have seen a significant increase in research on anger and its clinical treatment. As a result, anger management has become the topic of many self-help books, but there is currently no book that brings together for practitioners and scholars the diversity of therapies used to treat anger in various populations. Treatments for Anger in Specific Populations provides information and instruction on empirically supported interventions for anger in various clinical contexts, including substance abuse, PTSD, the intellectually disabled, borderline personality disorder, children and adolescents, and others. Ten chapters focus on specific populations, while two additional chapters discuss gender and culturally sensitive considerations in anger treatment. An introductory chapter by the volume editor, Ephrem Fernandez, outlines the main therapeutic approaches to anger, summarizing the boundaries between adaptive and maladaptive anger and providing a rationale for tailoring anger treatments to specific populations. For each population-specific chapter, authors provide theoretical background and literature review, followed by findings on the efficacy of each treatment. Each treatment evaluated is also clearly described in terms of clinical procedure. Further, each chapter contains a clinical case vignette illustrating the application of particular treatments to particular clients. Where appropriate, discussions of emerging and as-yet untested therapies are included. Treatments for Anger in Specific Populations is a resource to be treasured by clinicians who work regularly with anger problems and anger disorders, and the volume's careful balance of research review with important information about treatment application will also render it useful to scientists interested in anger.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZYJoAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hellstar","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Invitation to Provence","description":"Invited to attend a family reunion in Provence, Franny Marten leaves behind her unfaithful boyfriend to enjoy the region's beautiful landscapes, but someone is determined to prevent her discovery of family secrets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qPEzGmIcKPkC&dq=Invitation+to+Provence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insider's Guide to Finding a Job: Expert Advice from America's Top Employers and Recruiters","description":"Straight talk from America's top hiring managers and recruiters about how to succeed in a tight job market.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yABfGQAACAAJ&dq=Insider%27s+Guide+to+Finding+a+Job:+Expert+Advice+from+America%27s+Top+Employers+and+Recruiters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history and present state of Virginia","description":"While in London in 1705, Robert Beverley wrote and published The History and Present State of Virginia, one of the earliest printed English-language histories about North America by an author born there. Like his brother-in-law William Byrd II, Beverley was a scion of Virginia's planter elite, personally ambitious and at odds with royal governors in the colony. As a native-born American--most famously claiming \\"I am an Indian--he provided English readers with the first thoroughgoing account of the province's past, natural history, Indians, and current politics and society. In this new edition, Susan Scott Parrish situates Beverley and his History in the context of the metropolitan-provincial political and cultural issues of his day and explores the many contradictions embedded in his narrative. Parrish's introduction and the accompanying annotation, along with a fresh transcription of the 1705 publication and a more comprehensive comparison of emendations in the 1722 edition, will open Beverley's History to new, twenty-first-century readings by students of transatlantic history, colonialism, natural science, literature, and ethnohistory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OWHqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First American Revolution: The American Colonies on the Eve of Independence (Harvest Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wgQpzwEACAAJ&dq=The+First+American+Revolution:+The+American+Colonies+on+the+Eve+of+Independence+(Harvest+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Wildflowers in the Washington-Baltimore Area (Johns Hopkins Paperback)","description":"A thorough yet user-friendly companion to the authors' popular paperback Sugarloaf: The Mountain's History, Geology, and Natural Lore--both books are the result of a ten-year collaboration--this volume is an exquisitely illustrated guide to 350 eastern woodland wildflowers and trees found on site at Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland. Many of these plants also thrive across a wide region of the eastern United States and Canada, making this guide a remarkably helpful resource for both mid-Atlantic naturalists--amateur and experienced--and botanical enthusiasts across North America. Author Melanie Choukas-Bradley and illustrator Tina Thieme Brown have teamed up once again to create a practical tool for answering the age-old question frequently raised by visitors to the woods: \\"What is that plant over there?\\" At the same time, Choukas-Bradley and Brown aim to educate by presenting the plants grouped by family, so that the observer will learn to anticipate the presence of certain plants based on an understanding of their family characteristics. The text describes each plant's flower, leaf, and growth habit, gives its ideal habitat and range, describes similar species that might be confused with the plant, and gives an herbal history where applicable. And because plants are organized by family and genus, the scholarly reader can build on his or her botanical knowledge. An Illustrated Guide to Eastern Woodland Wildflowers and Trees includes a user-friendly key, an illustrated glossary of frequently used botanical terms, and is packed with nearly 400 elaborately and artistically detailed pen-and-ink drawings to make plant identification simple and fun.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hNaulBz0djcC&dq=Finding+Wildflowers+in+the+Washington-Baltimore+Area+(Johns+Hopkins+Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contentment is great gain: A missionary midwife in Sierra Leone","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PRI7AAAACAAJ&dq=Contentment+is+great+gain:+A+missionary+midwife+in+Sierra+Leone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boys of Summer","description":"This is a book about young men who learned to play baseball during the 1930s and 1940s, and then went on to play for one of the most exciting major-league ball clubs ever fielded, the team that broke the colour barrier with Jackie Robinson. It is a book by and about a sportswriter who grew up near Ebbets Field, and who had the good fortune in the 1950s to cover the Dodgers for the Herald Tribune. This is a book about what happened to Jackie, Carl Erskine, Pee Wee Reese, and the others when their glory days were behind them. In short, it is a book fathers and sons and about the making of modern America. 'At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams.' Sentimental because it holds such promise, and bittersweet because that promise is past, the first sentence of this masterpiece of sporting literature, first published in the early '70s, sets its tone. The team is the mid-20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of Robinson and Snyder and Hodges and Reese, a team of great triumph and historical import composed of men whose fragile lives were filled with dignity and pathos. Roger Kahn, who covered that team for the New York Herald Tribune, makes understandable humans of his heroes as he chronicles the dreams and exploits of their young lives, beautifully intertwining them with his own, then recounts how so many of those sweet dreams curdled as the body of these once shining stars grew rusty with age and battered by experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jTrLAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Boys+of+Summer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Differential Topology","description":"\\"A very valuable book.

How do national institutional differences condition economic performance, public policy, and social well-being? Will they survive the pressures for convergence generated by globalization and technological change? These have long been central questions in comparative political economy. This book provides a new and coherent set of answers to them. Building on the new economics of organization, the authors develop an important new theory about which differences among national political economies are most significant for economic policy and performance. Drawing on a distinction between 'liberal' and 'coordinated' market economies, they argue that there is more than one path to economic success. Nations need not converge to a single Anglo-American model. They develop a new theory of 'comparative institutionaladvantage' that transforms our understanding of international trade, offersnew explanations for the response of firms and nations to the challenges of globalization, and provides a new theory of national interest to explain the conduct of nations in international relations. The analysis brings the firm back into the centre of comparative political economy. It provides new perspectives on economic and social policy-making that illuminate the role of business in the development of the welfare state and the dilemmas facing those who make economic policy in the contemporary world. Emphasizing the 'institutional complementarities' that link labour relations, corporate finance, and national legal systems, the authors bring interdisciplinary perspectives to bear on issues of strategic management, economic performance, and institutional change. This pathbreaking work sets new agendas in the study of comparative political economy. As such, it will be of value to academics and graduate students in economics, business, and political science, as well as tomany others with interests in international relations, social policy-making, and the law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nYDnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Labor+and+the+Economy:+An+Introduction+to+Analysis,+Issues,+and+Institutions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Albrecht Drer (Prestel Postcards Books) (German Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VfkwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Albrecht+Drer+(Prestel+Postcards+Books)+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shiver (Signet)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3OIptwAACAAJ&dq=Shiver+(Signet)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living with the Bible","description":"Illustrated, personalized recreation of the dramatic events of the Old Testament as told by Israel's legendary soldier/statesman.

Going away to college offers a chance at love and a life free from her brilliant mother's constant scrutiny. Blake, a child of mixed race and apparently unknown parentage, has been raised by lawyers whose defence of death row cases has brought them into fierce dispute with Melissa's father, now a senator, then governor of Pennsylvania. When Melissa meets Blake at College, their passion is immediate. Yet Blake is keeping a dangerous secret from Melissa, one that could destroy both them and their families.

It showcases work produced at a number of the leading theatres during the last decade and charts something of the extraordinary range of current playwriting in America. It will be invaluable not only to readers and theatergoers in the U.S., but to those around the world seeking out new American plays and an insight into how U.S. playwrights are engaging with their current social and political environment. There is a rich collection of distinctive, diverse voices at work in the contemporary American theatre and this brings together six of the best, with work by David Adjmi, Marcus Gardley, Young Jean Lee, Katori Hall, Christopher Shinn and Dan LeFranc. The featured plays range from the intimate to the epic, the personal to the national and taken together explore a variety of cultural perspectives on life in America. The first play, David Adjmi's Stunning, is an excavation of ruptured identity set in modern day Midwood, Brooklyn, in the heart of the insular Syrian-Jewish community; Marcus Gardley's lyrical epic The Road Weeps, The Well Runs Dry deals with the migration of Black Seminoles, is set in mid-1800s Oklahoma and speaks directly to modern spirituality, relocation and cultural history; Young Jean Lee's Pullman, WA deals with self-hatred and the self-help culture in her formally inventive three-character play; Katori Hall's Hurt Village uses the real housing project of \\"Hurt Village\\" as a potent allegory for urban neglect set against the backdrop of the Iraq war; Christopher Shinn's Dying City melds the personal and political in a theatrical crucible that cracks open our response to 9/11 and Abu Graib, and finally Dan LeFranc's The Big Meal, an inter-generational play spanning eighty years, is set in the mid-west in a generic restaurant and considers family legacy and how some of the smallest events in life turn out to be the most significant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ES4QAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biblia de estudio: Arco Iris","description":"La caracter stica principal de esta Biblia es la codificaci n de los vers culos en 12 colores, que representan diferentes temas b blicos tales como Dios, discipulado, amor, familia y profec a entre otros.

And into that cardiogenic blaze tumble more words to encourage and sustain it: cruelty; love; hate; lust; murder; madness....In 1910 the Mexican Revolution raced across the face of the continent like a holocaust, driving every living thing before it, and most of those it drove, it overtook and destroyed. Those it could not destroy, or would not, it made mutant, their descendents capable of innocence, or amnesia; but it formed in their hearts, nevertheless, the language of future betrayels: the crude and familiar cartage of desperate human conflict. Here is a story of two men and a woman whom war could not destroy: Rodolfo Villalobos, a giant Yaqui Colonel of artillery in Pancho Villa's famed Division del Norte; Senorita Lucy Jurado, a beautiful Creol lady born to the Spanish aristocracy, and Lewis Flintoff Files, a demented, treasonous American sailor who escaped Saigon to fire the last shot of the Mexican Civil War. The first two characters depicted here were instrumental in the assassination of General Francisco Villa. The last one avenged him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ep9C58yo0kUC&dq=The+Rattler+of+Zacatecas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For Such a Time as This: A Renewed Diaconate in the Church of England","description":"For Such a Time as This takes a radical look at the ministry of Deacons in the Church. It brings biblical, theological and ecumenical perspectives to bear on a ministry that many believe has not yet realised its full potential. Diakonia is reinterpreted in the light of recent biblical research as fundamental commissioning for ministry - one that expresses the essential nature of the whole Church and underlies all ordained ministry. Deacons are seen as go-between or link persons in the mission space between the Church s liturgy and the needy world. This report of a Working Party of the House of Bishops, set up by the General Synod, also comments on the implications for lay ministry and proposes a concrete  job description  or ministerial profile for a renewed diaconate, one that is not merely transitional to the priesthood. The Report argues that the Diaconate comes into its own at times of social change and cultural crisis and that the time is now right to renew the diaconate for the sake of mission.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=53o31t4yAjoC&dq=For+Such+a+Time+as+This:+A+Renewed+Diaconate+in+the+Church+of+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming Mary Mehan (Readers Circle)","description":"Jennifer Armstrong s two masterful novels about Mary Mehan are now together in one volume.

Hawthorne, by birth and education, was instilled with the Puritan belief in America's limitless promise. Yet - in part because of blemishes on his own family history - he also saw the darker side of the young nation. Like his twentieth-century heirs William Faulkner and F.

By 2002 Kelton had not only earned his seventh Spur Award with Way of the Coyote, but had also won three Western Heritage Awards. The National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum honored Kelton for The Time it Never Rained in 1974, The Good Old Boys in 1979, and The Man Who Rode Midnight in 1988. With such accomplishments, it is easy to understand why, in 1995, the Western Writers of America voted Elmer Kelton the greatest western writer of all time. In The Far Canyon, Kelton masterfully unveils for his reader the finality of the buffalo s demise, the beginning of a time when cattle would replace the American bison on the southern plains and ultimately end the Plains Indian culture. The novel reveals the history of the period, not in a general grand swoop of the pen, but rather, up close and personal, so his readership can judge the impact of the period upon his characters. The novel s first chapter introduces Comanche warrior Crow Feather, whose situation is emblematic of a common recurring theme in all of Kelton s works . . . change. Protagonist Jeff Layne is faced with the very same dramatic problem, the devastating threat to one s self-concept inherent in change. Layne, the hide hunter from Slaughter is weary of killing and death. He decides to return to South Texas, determined to earn his living with the newest resource on the plains, cattle. And the cultures collide. Kelton eloquently reveals the impact of hide hunters on Plains Indian culture. Crow Feather realizes that no matter how many whites the Comanche kill, there will always be more  coming back.  Crow Feather also understands that his life and the lives of his wives and children will never be easy again. Are Layne and Crow Feather of a character that will allow them to escape a predetermined fate by reaching that far canyon, or will they simply perish under the cultural dictate of their historical time? The question is a thematic dilemma that Kelton excels at and it is what transforms his writing into serious literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_1HWQgAACAAJ&dq=Far+Canyon,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wedding Spell (Magical Love)","description":"Love spells candle magic book contains the most powerful love spells that work for different situations.

Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.

That's why I tried to go into different forms of activity -- purely optical things and kineticism\\". When Gabrielle Buffet discovered Duchamp's Rotoreliefs, she emphasized this point further: \\"Duchamp's aim was to primarily to modify all plastic matter, to reject once and for all from his working arsenal all the traditional tools and equipment (tubes of paint, canvas, and brushes); to obtain the effect by mechanical means instead of through the expression of personal dynamism inherent in a particular individuality; to substitute technical value for expressive value\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MrYRwAACAAJ&dq=The+complete+works+of+Marcel+Duchamp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hermeneutics as Politics (Odion)","description":"A new multidisciplinary series, ODEON will serve as a transfer point--much as the station ODEON in the Paris metro--for the many provocative lines of thought that enliven contemporary cultural criticism. ODEON will publish original works and translations that enhance the intellectual exchange between Europe and the English-speaking world in the areas of literature, criticism, philosophy, and historical and political reflection. Combining exemplary scholarship and analytic precision, Stanley Rosen illuminates the underpinnings of post-modernist thought, providing valuable insight as he pursues two arguments: first, that post-modernism, which regards itself as an attack upon the Enlightenment, is in fact the penultimate stage of the Enlightenment itself; and second, that the extraordinary contemporary emphasis upon hermeneutics is the latest consequence of the triumph of history over mathematics within the unstable essence of the Enlightenment. Hermeneutics is consequently at bottom a political phenomenon. In developing these arguments, Rosen demonstrates the paradigmatic status of Kant for a proper understanding of post-modernism, analyzes Derrida's influential critique of Platonism as well as his defense of writing, explains the political dimension of the quarrel between the ancients and moderns by studying the hermeneutics of Leo Strauss and Alexander Kojeve, and shows how the modern notion of \\"theory\\" is intrinsically relativized by the triumph of history over mathematics into the notion of interpretation. A wide-ranging exploration into current critical thinking, Hermeneutics as Politics will generate considerable debate among scholars interested in post-modernism, the Enlightenment, hermeneutics, the relation of philosophy and politics, deconstruction, and the history of philosophy.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EYLhV3M4Uf8C&dq=Hermeneutics+as+Politics+(Odion)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traffic Jam","description":"Out for a drive, a family finds itself in a traffic jam created by animals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=upaDP-hqQlYC&dq=Traffic+Jam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Jon","description":"With a seamless weave of letters, reminiscences, poems, and journal entries, Eleni Sikelianos creates a loving portrait - and an unblinking indictment - of her father, Jon: a talented musician, a high school dropout, an autodidact descendent of Greek nobility, and, for much of his life, a drug addict.

This critical study examines the Fortune stories in the context of other popular detective fiction of the era.

It is considered by many to be her single greatest work, and as with much of Gilman's writing, the book touched a few dominant themes: the transformation of marriage, the family, and the home, with her central argument: \\"the economic independence and specialization of women as essential to the improvement of marriage, motherhood, domestic industry, and racial improvement.\\" The 1890s were a period of intense political debate and economic challenges, with the Women's Movement seeking the vote and other reforms. Women were \\"entering the work force in swelling numbers, seeking new opportunities, and shaping new definitions of themselves.\\" It was near the end of this tumultuous decade that Gilman's very popular book emerged. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was a prominent American feminist, sociologist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction, and a lecturer for social reform.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DGVODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The toynapers (The incredible adventures of Kitto)","description":"Success at the International Toy Competition brings Kitto and his toys great recognition which leads to upheaval, and even greater adventure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pA19MAAACAAJ&dq=The+toynapers+(The+incredible+adventures+of+Kitto)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Olympic Games: ATHENS 1896 - ATHENS 2004","description":"A visual tour of the history of the modern Olympic Games reveals hidden rivalries, boycotts, triumphs, and tragedies, and lists all the events and medalists since the beginning of the Games.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kZPStwEACAAJ&dq=The+Olympic+Games:+ATHENS+1896+-+ATHENS+2004&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History will absolve me","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XnC2zgEACAAJ&dq=History+will+absolve+me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mindstar Rising (Greg Mandel)","description":"Mindstar Rising is the first in Peter F.

Sixty-four of these avid fans, historians, statisticians, and game enthusiasts recorded their experiences for this book. Some wrote from privileged views such as inside the Green Monster s manual scoreboard, the Braves clubhouse, and the broad- cast booth, while others took in the essence of Fenway from the grandstand or bleachers. The result is a fascinating look at Major League Baseball, the Red Sox and their colorful history, the charms and challenges of Fenway Park, and the allure of being a baseball fan. Including articles on Red Sox/Boston Braves history and the City Series, The Fenway Project combines historical background as only SABR can deliver it with this fascinating \\"one night at the ballpark\\" as recorded by 64 observers on the spot. From the man who sang the National Anthem (SABR member Joe Mancuso) to the woman who threw out the first pitch (SABR's president Claudia Perry), from a man in the bleachers to a woman in the press box, readers of The Fenway Project will see the game from all angles.

In a recent contest, Bob has proved himself a matchless sheepdog, and if he wins the trophy two more times, he ll be seen as equal to the legendary sheepdogs of yore. But Bob has a real rival: Red Wull, with his docked tail and bristling yellow fur, a ferocious creature, just like his diminutive master, Adam McAdam, a lonely Scot, estranged not only from his English neighbors but from his son, David. McAdam just can t stop belittling this strapping young man, all the more so since David began courting Moore s beautiful daughter Maggie. But what McAdam really wants is for his beloved Wullie to wrest the prize from Bob once and for all. The story takes a darker turn when a troubling new threat to the local flocks emerges. A dog has gone rogue, sneaking out at night to feast on the flesh and blood of the sheep he is bound to protect. Again and again, new sheep fall prey to this relentless predator; again and again, he slips away undetected. This master hunter can only be among the boldest and sharpest of dogs . . . Bob, Son of Battle has long been a beloved classic of children s literature both in America and in England.

Those disparities are caused not only by fundamental differences in health status across segments of the population, but also because of inequities in factors that impact health status, so-called determinants of health. Only part of an individual's health status depends on his or her behavior and choice; community-wide problems like poverty, unemployment, poor education, inadequate housing, poor public transportation, interpersonal violence, and decaying neighborhoods also contribute to health inequities, as well as the historic and ongoing interplay of structures, policies, and norms that shape lives. When these factors are not optimal in a community, it does not mean they are intractable: such inequities can be mitigated by social policies that can shape health in powerful ways. Communities in Action: Pathways to Health Equity seeks to delineate the causes of and the solutions to health inequities in the United States. This report focuses on what communities can do to promote health equity, what actions are needed by the many and varied stakeholders that are part of communities or support them, as well as the root causes and structural barriers that need to be overcome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AIKPDgAAQBAJ&dq=Asthma%27s+Impact+on+Society:+The+Social+and+Economic+Burden+(Lung+Biology+in+Health+and+Disease,+V.+138)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get Those Bookings: Marketing Strategies for Professional Speakers","description":"What does it take to become a well-known expert in your field - someone other practitioners and the media seek out for leadership and insight?

In doing so, he adapted such popular novels as The Killing, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining and selected a wide variety of genres for his films -- black comedy (Dr. Strangelove), science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey), and war (Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket). Because he was peerless in unveiling the intimate mysteries of human nature, no new film by Kubrick ever failed to spark debate or to be deeply pondered. Kubrick (1928-1999) has remained as elusive as the subjects of his films. Unlike many other filmmakers he was not inclined to grant interviews, instead preferring to let his movies speak for themselves. By allowing both critics and moviegoers to see the inner workings of this reclusive filmmaker, this first comprehensive collection of his relatively few interviews is invaluable. Ranging from 1959 to 1987 and including Kubrick's conversations with Gene Siskel, Jeremy Bernstein, Gene D. Phillips, and others, this book reveals Kubrick's diverse interests -- nuclear energy and its consequences, space exploration, science fiction, literature, religion, psychoanalysis, the effects of violence, and even chess -- and discloses how each affects his films. He enthusiastically speaks of how advances in camera and sound technology made his films more effective. Kubrick details his hands-on approach to filmmaking as he discusses why he supervises nearly every aspect of production. \\"All the hand-held camerawork is mine,\\" he says in a 1972 interview about A Clockwork Orange. \\"In addition to the fun of doing the shooting myself, I find it virtually impossible to explain what I want in a hand-held shot to even the most talented and sensitive camera operator. \\" Neither guarded nor evasive, the Kubrick who emerges from these interviews is candid, opinionated, confident, and articulate. His incredible memory and his gift for organization come to light as he quotes verbatim sections of reviews, books, and articles. Despite his reputation as a recluse, the Kubrick of these interviews is approachable, witty, full of anecdotes, and eager to share a fascinating story. Gene D. Phillips, S.J., is a professor of English at Loyola University in Chicago, where he teaches fiction and the history of film. He is the author of many notable books on film and is a founding member of the editorial board of both Literature/Film Quarterly and The Tennessee Williams Journal. He was acquainted with Stanley Kubrick for twenty-five years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CQjYUJEjJLgC&dq=Stanley+Kubrick:+Interviews+(Conversations+with+Filmmakers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Major Problems in African American History, Vol. 2: From Freedom to Freedom Now, 1865-1990s","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rM-DrgEACAAJ&dq=Major+Problems+in+African+American+History,+Vol.+2:+From+Freedom+to+Freedom+Now,+1865-1990s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riley Child Rhymes","description":"An illustrated collection of 39 of James Whitcomb Riley's signature poems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tn0CAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows Script Host Programmer's Reference","description":"The Windows Scripting Host (WSH) is Microsoft's evolutionary answer to a much-needed programming environment for the Windows desktop.

He was a Tutor (1860-1861) and Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature (1861-1868) at Middlebury College in Vermont, United States. From 1868 to 1907 he was professor at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. He published a number of influential education books, some of which are available on Project Gutenberg. Kellogg was the author of Rhetoric; History of the English Language. With Alonzo Reed, he jointly authored Graded Lessons in English; Higher Lessons in English; A One Book Course. He authored a variety of textbooks on English writing and literature, including a series on the works of William Shakespeare. Most methods of diagramming in pedagogy are based on the work of Alonzo Reed and Brainerd Kellogg in their book Higher Lessons in English, first published in 1877, though the method has been updated with recent understanding of grammar. Reed and Kellogg were preceded, and their work probably informed, by W. S. Clark, who published his \\"balloon\\" method of depicting grammar in his 1847 book A Practical Grammar: In Which Words, Phrases & Sentences are Classified According to Their Offices and Their Various Relationships to Each Another. Some schoolteachers continue to use the ReedKellogg system in teaching grammar, but others have discouraged it in favor of more modern tree diagrams.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MhJUCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schematic Capture Using MicroSim PSpice for Windows 95/98/NT","description":"Accompanying CD-ROM has MicroSim PSpice evaluation version 8.0, Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0, and floppy disk copy files.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hFdtbS8kGVoC&dq=Schematic+Capture+Using+MicroSim+PSpice+for+Windows+95/98/NT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Midnight Hour","description":"For fans of portal fantasies like Jessica Townsend's Nevermoor, Colin Meloy's Wildwood, and The Spiderwick Chronicles by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, and unlike so many other fantasies that introduce readers to a world of enchantment and wonder, The Midnight Hour is one filled with beasts and monsters for readers looking to shine their flashlights under the covers. When strange late-night letters start arriving at home, Emily's parents set off to investigate. But when her parents disappear completely and Emily is left home alone to face the weird strangers that begin to appear at her door, she takes all of the clues at her disposal and makes for the place where the letters came from -- the mysterious Night Post. What she'll discover is the secret world of the Midnight Hour -- a Victorian London frozen in time, full of magic and monsters. Kept safe by an age-old agreement, the Night Folk have been exiled to a parallel world that can only be accessed by a selected few, including the mail carriers of the infamous Night Post that operate between the two worlds. Emily's parents are key players in keeping the Night Folk safe, but when the division of the two worlds is threatened, Emily must search for her parents while navigating this dark and unknown version of London. Armed only with a packed lunch, her very sleepy pocket hedgehog, and her infamously big argumentative mouth, she must escape bloodthirsty creatures of the night, figure out her own family secrets, and maybe just save the world. This is a frightening and enchanting story, a world built out of creatures from our worst fears who become relatable, fully formed characters unlike any we've seen as these strangers of parallel worlds band together to save the day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xD2ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crookjaw","description":"\\"A colonial whaler from Nantucket who caught his first whale with his teething ring ...

There he encountered Mahounon, one of the most influential voodoo priests of West Africa. Abandoning his planned trip, Venzago set out instead on an odyssey through the world of African voodoo, to which he and his camera gained extraordinary access. The result is a groundbreaking new documentary and this accompanying book. Venzago followed Mahounon with his camera for nearly ten years, filming secret Voodoo ceremonies and sacrificial rituals. He witnessed Mahounon's extraordinary search for a successor to lead the cult, and he watched as the anointed eleven-year old boy, Gounon, was schooled in black and white magic, rituals, and the intricate workings of the Fa, or Voodoo oracle. Venzago's camera evokes the religious ecstasy of these ceremonies as well as their otherworldly atmosphere.

Two competing nations have founded their remote, interplanetary outposts on the red planet, separated by over two thousand kilometers of alien and hostile desert. Without warning, communications with the earth are suddenly and inexplicably lost. All systematized transmissions from earth have ceased. It is as though the earth has disappeared. Without warning or explanation, the colonists are alone in the universe. Survival on Mars is a synthesis of skill, intellect, courage as well as the most advanced technology ever developed. But in no one's blackest nightmare has anyone ever planned on permanently severing all links with the home planet. The thin barrier between life and death has just been sliced in two - and now the relatively small band of humans are no longer explorers, but now they are interplanetary castaways, waiting for a rescue that may never come. Now there are too many people and there is far too little to go around. It soon becomes apparent, they would have to fight one another to live - war on another planet becomes the only way out. Dennis Chamberland's Abyss of Elysium - Mars Wars - is filled with the full sweep of the most dramatic, high-tech, nail biting audacious adventure in the genre. Chamberland's style is characterized by a sustained extreme energy, high stakes and maximum passion, a fusion of the human drama and the technology that links the humans with an alien planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ymnlp7fAIQ0C&dq=Mars+Wars:+Abyss+of+Elysium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"more streets and roads","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mpiwtAEACAAJ&dq=more+streets+and+roads&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Completely Smitten","description":"A rollicking modern fairy tale follows Andrew Vari, who must unite a thousand pairs of soulmates in order to lift a curse, which has robbed him of his good looks, given to him by the Fates due to his vanity, as he encounters gorgeous Ariel Summers, who falls for him despite his appearance, changing his life forever.

The family is entangled in an 8th century east-west religious struggle between the idol-bashing supporters of Judaism and Islam and the art-loving Greeks and Romans. Part of the Psellus family is exiled to Cappadocia, as part of an imperial program to unify and defend the Byzantine Empire. The exiles establish Kalivarion, a Cappadocian colony. The families survive four centuries (700-1100 AD) of Byzantine turmoil and struggle. One of them, historian and politician Michael Psellus left behind an Empire in ruins and his famous history of that period. The family changes their name to Megas to avoid humiliation and becomes intertwined with the Stravolemis family, after the liberation of a bastard slave from Crete. During recent centuries, Byzantium had an undeservingly critical view by western authors. It was only lately, that light has been shed on how important Byzantine culture was in the development of our Western civilization. Our knowledge of Greek and Roman literature and law, we owe to the Byzantines. Western renaissance was based on Byzantine art, music and thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3fMLAAAACAAJ&dq=Andros+Odyssey:+Byzantine+Kalivarion:+705+AD-1078+AD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Scandal to Hope","description":"If you've been shocked by what you see in the news, read this book.

While many scholars believe that Levinas failed to develop a robust view of political ethics, Michael L. Morgan argues against understandings of Levinas's thought that find him politically wanting or even antipolitical. Morgan examines Levinas's ethical critique of the political as well as his Jewish writings including those on Zionism and the founding of the Jewish state which are controversial reflections of Levinas's political expression. Unlike others who dismiss Levinas as irrelevant or anarchical, Morgan is the first to give extensive treatment to Levinas as a serious social political thinker whose ethics must be understood in terms of its political implications. Morgan reveals Levinas's political commitments to liberalism and democracy as well as his revolutionary conception of human life as deeply interconnected on philosophical, political, and religious grounds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WlsoDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Harrison Affair","description":"This last book from beloved Hollywood icon Carrie Fisher is the crown jewel of ideal Star Wars gifts. The Princess Diarist is an intimate, hilarious, and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time. When Carrie Fisher discovered the journals she kept during the filming of the first Star Wars movie, she was astonished to see what they had preserved plaintive love poems, unbridled musings with youthful naivet , and a vulnerability that she barely recognized. Before her passing, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon was indisputable, but in 1977, Carrie Fisher was just a teenager with an all-consuming crush on her costar, Harrison Ford. With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, The Princess Diarist is Fisher s intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the most famous film sets of all time and what developed behind the scenes. Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the absurdity of a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by her own outer-space royalty. Laugh-out-loud hilarious and endlessly quotable, The Princess Diarist brims with the candor and introspection of a diary while offering shrewd insight into one of Hollywood's most beloved stars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OBg3DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Harrison+Affair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes: A Calvin and Hobbes Treasury","description":"Features the hyperimaginative six-year-old and his guardian tiger in their most memorable adventures from \\"Revenge of the Baby-Sat\\" and \\"Scientific Progress Goes Boink\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NV4WEqQtvTYC&dq=The+Indispensable+Calvin+and+Hobbes:+A+Calvin+and+Hobbes+Treasury&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strawman's Hammock","description":"On a chilly October morning, Barrett \\"Bear\\" Raines finds himself on the campground of Linton Loyd, one of the richest men in Florida, watching Linton clean his latest catch.

But the most sugnificant and important use of information warfare won't be on the battlefield. The most devastating weapons will be those that target an enemy's infrastructure - air-control systems, electrical grids, and communication networks, to name just a few potential targets. By hacking into computer systems, the United States could override programmed commands and thus shut down air traffic control systems, and open floodgates and bridges. Misinformation could even be broadcast, for example, by using imaging technology to simulate a television appearance by an enemy nation's leaders. This type of combat puts civilians at more risk than ever, as financial, communications, transportation, and other infrastructure systems become prime military targets. And information warfare puts the United States - a nation increasingly dependent on technology - in a position of both definite advantage and extreme vulnerability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4JRHSIFQIFYC&dq=The+Next+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CISA Exam Cram 2: Certified Information Systems Auditor","description":"Want an affordable yet innovative approach to studying for the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) 2005 exam?

Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London in 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823.Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character \\"makes a deliberate decision\\" and \\"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\\" to achieve fantastic results. It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films and plays.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mmw-ofzWQMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Federal Contracting Made Easy","description":"Federal contracting . . . easy?

Almost every day we hear of new innovations in technology, in medicine and in the arts which remind us that humans are capable of remarkable creativity. But what is human creativity? The modern world provides a tiny fraction of cultural diversity and the evidence for human creativity, far more can be seen by looking back into prehistory. The book examines how our understanding of human creativity can be extended by exploring this phenomenon during human evolution and prehistory. The book offers unique perspectives on the nature of human creativity from archaeologists who are concerned with long term patterns of cultural change and have access to quite different types of human behaviour than that which exists today. It asks whether humans are the only creative species, or whether our extinct relatives such as Homo habilis and the Neanderthals also displayed creative thinking. It explores what we can learn about the nature of human creativity from cultural developments during prehistory, such as changes in the manner in which the dead were buried, monuments constructed, and the natural world exploited. In doing so, new light is thrown on these cultural developments and the behaviour of our prehistoric ancestors. By examining the nature of creativity during human evolution and prehistory these archaeologists, supported by contributions from psychology, computer science and social anthropology, show that human creativity is a far more diverse and complex phenomena than simply flashes of genius by isolated individuals. Indeed they show that unless perspectives from prehistory are taken into account, our understanding of human creativity will be limited and incomplete.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mXKGAgAAQBAJ&dq=Human+Evolution+and+Prehistory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"InterSections: Architectural Histories and Critical Theories","description":"Over the last decade, critical theories of different kinds have had an enormous impact on many different disciplines and practices.

A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the  Austrian School,  which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong   and strongly reasoned   anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orchids of the western Great Lakes region, (Cranbrook Institute of Science.

As a pilot's wife, Kathryn has learned to expect both intense exhilaration and long periods alone, but nothing has prepared her for a late-night knock that lets her know her husband has died in a crash. Until now, Kathryn Lyons's life has been peaceful if unextraordinary: a satisfying job teaching high school in the New England mill town of her childhood; a picture-perfect home by the ocean; a precocious, independent-minded fifteen-year-old daughter; and a happy marriage whose occasional dull passages she attributes to the unavoidable deadening of time. As Kathryn struggles with her grief, she descends into a maelstrom of publicity stirred up by the modern hunger for the details of tragedy. Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus.

High School is the revelatory and unique coming-of-age story of Sara and Tegan Quin, identical twins from Calgary, Alberta, growing up in the height of grunge and rave culture in the  90s, well before they became the celebrated musicians and global LGBTQ icons we know today. While grappling with their identity and sexuality, often alone, they also faced academic meltdown, their parents  divorce, and the looming pressure of what might come after high school.

Since that time, the work has established a powerful hold on the western popular imagination, and is now considered a classic of spiritual literature. Over the years, The Tibetan Book of the Dead has inspired numerous commentaries, an illustrated edition, a play, a video series, and even an opera. Translators, scholars, and popular devotees of the book have claimed to explain its esoteric ideas and reveal its hidden meaning. Few, however, have uttered a word about its history. Bryan J. Cuevas seeks to fill this gap in our knowledge by offering the first comprehensive historical study of the Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Bardo, and by grounding it firmly in the context of Tibetan history and culture. He begins by discussing the many ways the texts have been understood (and misunderstood) by westerners, beginning with its first editor, the Oxford-educated anthropologist Walter Y. Evans-Wentz, and continuing through the present day. The remarkable fame of the book in the west, Cuevas argues, is strikingly disproportionate to how the original Tibetan texts were perceived in their own country. Cuevas tells the story of how The Tibetan Book of the Dead was compiled in Tibet, of the lives of those who preserved and transmitted it, and explores the history of the rituals through which the life of the dead is imagined in Tibetan society. This book provides not only a fascinating look at a popular and enduring spiritual work, but also a much-needed corrective to the proliferation of ahistorical scholarship surrounding The Tibetan Book of the Dead.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3vIRLMBvhQIC&dq=The+Hidden+History+of+the+Tibetan+Book+of+the+Dead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden Notebook","description":"Anna is a writer, author of one very successful novel, who now keeps four notebooks.

Now updated to place the city in the context of the events of the Syrian conflict post-2011, and to include the most recent scholarship on the long history of the city, this volume is a must-read for anyone interested in Syrian history and archaeology, and an ideal partner to Burns' Aleppo (Routledge, 2016).

Today kids are often seen as a threat to our social and moral values. In schools, some behavior is criminalized, and growing numbers of kids find themselves in penal and psychiatric confinement. This breakdown is often too readily attributed to bad parenting, the crisis of the family, or the greed of capitalism. Grossberg offers a new and original understanding of the changes transforming contemporary America, and of the choices Americans face about their future. He documents the relations between economic ideologies and economic realities and explores what is going on in the \\"culture wars\\" as well as on the Internet and other new media. Caught in the Crossfire argues that all of these changes and tn struggles, including those involving the state of kids, only make sense as integral parts of a larger transformation to define America's uniqueness and to develop its own sense of modern culture.

Mothers-to-be are invited to look deeply at the issues unique to their journey and find a centered, peaceful place to live their pregnancy fully.

Regardless of database engine, platform, language, or application, developers repeatedly encounter the same relational database access challenges. In Data Access Patterns, Clifton Nock identifies 25 proven solutions, presenting each one in the form of a clear, easy-to-use pattern. These patterns solve an exceptionally wide range of problems including creating efficient database-independent applications, hiding obscure database semantics from users, speeding database resource initialization, simplifying development and maintenance, improving support for concurrency and transactions, and eliminating data access bottlenecks. Every pattern is illustrated with fully commented Java/JDBC code examples, as well as UML diagrams representing interfaces, classes, and relationships. The patterns are organized into five categories: Decoupling Patterns: Build cleaner, more reliable systems by decoupling data access code from other application logic Resource Patterns: Manage relational database resources more efficiently Input/Output Patterns: Simplify I/O operations by translating consistently between \\"physical\\" relational data and domain object representations of that data Cache Patterns: Use caching strategically, to optimize the tradeoffs between data access optimization and cache overhead Concurrency Patterns: Implement concurrency and transactions more effectively and reliably Data Access Patterns demystifies techniques that have traditionally been used only in the most robust data access solutions--making those techniques practical for every software developer, architect, and designer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fi5wPwAACAAJ&dq=Data+Access+Patterns:+Database+Interactions+in+Object-Oriented+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In search of deity: An essay in dialectical theism (The Gifford lectures)","description":"The classical defence of, and arguments for, belief in God have not proved completely satisfactory, particularly in the perspective of modern times, and in the Gifford Lectures for 1983-4, given at the University of St Andrews, Professor Macquarrie puts forward an alternative. He calls his approach 'dialectical theism': dialectical, to indicate that he seeks to avoid the onesidedness of classical theism, and theism (as opposed to pantheism or panentheism) to show that he is still concerned to arrive at a satisfying conception of God. After indicating some of the weaknesses of classical theism, and outlining other approaches which have been put forward, Dr Macquarrie discusses a long series of thinkers who, he argues, represent an alternative tradition: Plotinus, Dionysius the Areopagite, Johannes Scotus Eriugena, Nicholas of Cusa, Leibniz, Hegel, Whitehead and Heidegger. In the last section of his book, against this background he develops his dialectical concept of God, re-examines the proofs for the existence of God and shows how dialectical theism has a bearing on spirituality, ethics, theology and world religions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RPpBAQAAIAAJ&dq=In+search+of+deity:+An+essay+in+dialectical+theism+(The+Gifford+lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Daily Bible Devotional Journal: A Companion for Reading Through the Bible in One Year","description":"With more than half a million copies in print, The Daily Bible(R) has long been one of the bestselling specialty Bibles, offering a chronological arrangement of the NIV text in a 365-day reading format.

In Death by Government, Rummel does not aim to describe democide itself, but to determine its nature and scope in order to test the theory that democracies are inherently nonviolent. Rummel discusses genocide in China, Nazi Germany, Japan, Cambodia, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Pakistan. He also writes about areas of suspected genocide: North Korea, Mexico, and feudal Russia. His results clearly and decisively show that democracies commit less democide than other regimes. The underlying principle is that the less freedom people have, the greater the violence; the more freedom, the less the violence. Thus, as Rummel says, a??The problem is power. The solution is democracy. The course of action is to foster freedom.a?? Death by Government is a compelling look at the horrors that occur in modern societies. It depicts how democide has been very much a part of human history. Among other examples, the book includes the massacre of Europeans during the Thirty Years' War, the relatively unknown genocide of the French Revolution, and the slaughtering of American Indians by colonists in the New World. This riveting account is an essential tool for historians, political scientists, and scholars interested in the study of genocide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5B65QOhz3NcC&dq=Death+by+Government&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Easter Through the Year: Making the Most of the Resurrection","description":"Features ideas, reflections, and resources on how to extend the message of resurrection through the weeks following Easter and into the rest of our lives.

Their design and construction epitomize the central challenge of national park management: how to balance environmental protection with public access. The Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), a division of the National Park Service, has spent more than a dozen years documenting the history of this vital aspect of the national park experience. America's National Park Roads and Parkways brings together 331 measured and interpretive drawings commissioned by HAER to illustrate the physical characteristics, design strategies, construction practices, and visitor experiences of roads in national parks from Acadia to Zion and parkways from the Blue Ridge to the Natchez Trace. Also included are nonPark Service projects that utilized similar design strategies, including the Bronx River Parkway and the Columbia River Highway. The book documents thirty-one projects, explaining how roads shape visitor perceptions, highlighting key characteristics of individual park road systems, and connecting their design and construction to the broader history of American engineering and landscape architecture. More than a documentary record of historic design and construction practices, this book has practical applications for engineers, landscape architects, and cultural resource specialists in guiding design decisions, interpreting historic sites, and informing contemporary debates on preservation and environmental protection.

Murray Newton Rothbard (1926 - 1995) was an American author and economist of the Austrian School who helped define capitalist libertarianism and popularized a form of free-market anarchism he termed \\"anarcho-capitalism.\\" Rothbard wrote over twenty books and is considered a centrally important figure in the American libertarian movement. Building on the Austrian School's concept of spontaneous order, support for a free market in money production and condemnation of central planning, Rothbard advocated abolition of coercive government control of society and the economy. He considered the monopoly force of government the greatest danger to liberty and the long-term well-being of the populace, labeling the State as nothing but a \\"gang of thieves writ large\\"-the locus of the most immoral, grasping and unscrupulous individuals in any society. Rothbard concluded that all services provided by monopoly governments could be provided more efficiently by the private sector.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZC7bygAACAAJ&dq=What+has+government+done+to+our+money%3F+(Studies+in+human+action)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crest of the Stars (Seikai Trilogy, Vol. 1)","description":"After his home is captured, a boy named Jinto begins a journey that he will never forget.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vp-0swEACAAJ&dq=Crest+of+the+Stars+(Seikai+Trilogy,+Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moravians in Georgia, 1735-1740","description":"The Moravian Brethren are one of the most notable of the pietistic sects to emerge from the Protestant Reformation.

From the longtime CEO and chairman of Starbucks, a bold, dramatic work about the new responsibilities that leaders, businesses, and citizens share in American society today as viewed through the intimate lens of one man s life and work. What do we owe one another? How do we channel our drive, ingenuity, even our pain, into something more meaningful than individual success? And what is our duty in the places where we live, work, and play? These questions are at the heart of the American journey. They are also ones that Howard Schultz has grappled with personally since growing up in the Brooklyn housing projects and while building Starbucks from eleven stores into one of the world s most iconic brands. In From the Ground Up, Schultz looks for answers in two interwoven narratives. One story shows how his conflicted boyhood including experiences he has never before revealed motivated Schultz to become the first in his family to graduate from college, then to build the kind of company his father, a working-class laborer, never had a chance to work for: a business that tries to balance profit and human dignity. A parallel story offers a behind-the-scenes look at Schultz s unconventional efforts to challenge old notions about the role of business in society. From health insurance and free college tuition for part-time baristas to controversial initiatives about race and refugees, Schultz and his team tackled societal issues with the same creativity and rigor they applied to changing how the world consumes coffee. Throughout the book, Schultz introduces a cross-section of Americans transforming common struggles into shared successes. In these pages, lost youth find first jobs, aspiring college students overcome the yoke of debt, post-9/11 warriors replace lost limbs with indomitable spirit, former coal miners and opioid addicts pave fresh paths, entrepreneurs jump-start dreams, and better angels emerge from all corners of the country. From the Ground Up is part candid memoir, part uplifting blueprint of mutual responsibility, and part proof that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. At its heart, it s an optimistic, inspiring account of what happens when we stand up, speak out, and come together for purposes bigger than ourselves. Here is a new vision of what can be when we try our best to lead lives through the lens of humanity.  Howard Schultz s story is a clear reminder that success is not achieved through individual determination alone, but through partnership and community. Howard s commitment to both have helped him build one of the world s most recognized brands. It will be exciting to see what he accomplishes next.

This volume focuses on the convergence of computers and communications technologies. Most of the concepts that are generic to all intelligent networks, and their microscopic and macroscopic functions, are presented. This book includes specific architectures that can be used by network designers and planners, telecommunications managers, computer scientists, and telecommunications professionals. The breadth of this coverage and the systems orientation of this work make the text suitable for use in advanced level courses on intelligent communications networks. The material in this volume ranges from defining intelligent networks to more specific coverage of educational, medical, and knowledge-based networks. Each of the 20 chapters address issues that can help make the transition from computer design, to the underlying concepts of modern telecommunications systems, to considerations necessary for the implementation of intelligent network services. Special and timely coverage of emerging technologies, such as HDSL, ADSL, BISDN, wireless, broadband access, ATM, and other topics, are given expanded treatment. The authors have included design methodologies for installing intelligence into almost any communications systems, and procedures for using such intelligence according to the type of function expected from these networks. Unique features of the book are: a 64-page glossary of key terms (with expanded explanations) used in the field, a 23-page index that makes it easy to search for important information, running headers on each page to help the busy professional use the book as a reference/design tool, complete references including additional reading for more detailed information, and accurate and concise information to help telecommunications professionals understand the intricacies of the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mtmHmQEACAAJ&dq=Intelligent+Broadband+Multimedia+Networks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elegy for the Southern Drawl","description":"Celebrating the essence of life in the South, a collection of poems chronicles the life cycle of a young southern white male, from high school football to losing his virginity, from ignorant youth to self-awareness.

Frances Fox Piven, one of the most celebrated US social scientists, raises questions others have not. She examines the ways the War on Terror served to reinforce the Bush administration's political base and analyzes the manner in which flag-waving politicians used the emotional fog of war to further their regressive social and economic agendas. Always in the past, US governments that made war sooner or later tried to reward their peoples for the blood and wealth they were forced to sacrifice. During World War II, tax rates on the wealthy rose to 90 percent; toward the end of the Vietnam War, 18-year-olds were given the right to vote.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X8GeGwAACAAJ&dq=The+War+at+Home:+The+Domestic+Costs+of+Bush%27s+Militarism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garlic Lovers' Greatest Hits: 20 Years of Prize-Winning Recipes from the Gilroy Garlic Festival","description":"Winning the hearts of garlic-lovers everywhere, the recipes collected here are the favorites of the Gilroy garlic Festival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=odV5QwAACAAJ&dq=Garlic+Lovers%27+Greatest+Hits:+20+Years+of+Prize-Winning+Recipes+from+the+Gilroy+Garlic+Festival&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taras Bulba","description":"The First New Translation in Forty Years Set sometime between the mid-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century, Gogol s epic tale recounts both a bloody Cossack revolt against the Poles (led by the bold Taras Bulba of Ukrainian folk mythology) and the trials of Taras Bulba s two sons. As Robert Kaplan writes in his Introduction,  [Taras Bulba] has a Kiplingesque gusto . . . that makes it a pleasure to read, but central to its theme is an unredemptive, darkly evil violence that is far beyond anything that Kipling ever touched on. We need more works like Taras Bulba to better understand the emotional wellsprings of the threat we face today in places like the Middle East and Central Asia.  And the critic John Cournos has noted,  A clue to all Russian realism may be found in a Russian critic s observation about Gogol:  Seldom has nature created a man so romantic in bent, yet so masterly in portraying all that is unromantic in life.  But this statement does not cover the whole ground, for it is easy to see in almost all of Gogol s work his  free Cossack soul  trying to break through the shell of sordid today like some ancient demon, essentially Dionysian. So that his works, true though they are to our life, are at once a reproach, a protest, and a challenge, ever calling for joy, ancient joy, that is no more with us. And they have all the joy and sadness of the Ukrainian songs he loved so much.

Historians Gerard Colby and Charlotte Dennett tell the story of the forty-year campaign led by Standard Oil scion Nelson Rockefeller and Wycliffe Bible Translators founder William Cameron Townsend to establish a US imperial beachhead in Central and South America. Beginning in the 1940s, future Vice President Rockefeller worked with the CIA and allies in the banking industry to prop up repressive governments, devastate the Amazon rain forest, and destabilize local economies all in the name of anti-Communism.

The Ancient Greeks took no notice of anything unless it was said in Greek; the Romans made everyone speak Latin; and in India, people learned their neighbors' languages as did many ordinary Europeans in times past (Christopher Columbus knew Italian, Portuguese, and Castilian Spanish as well as the classical languages). But today, we all use translation to cope with the diversity of languages. Without translation there would be no world news, not much of a reading list in any subject at college, no repair manuals for cars or planes; we wouldn't even be able to put together flat-pack furniture. Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across the whole of human experience, from foreign films to philosophy, to show why translation is at the heart of what we do and who we are. Among many other things, David Bellos asks: What's the difference between translating unprepared natural speech and translating Madame Bovary? How do you translate a joke? What's the difference between a native tongue and a learned one? Can you translate between any pair of languages, or only between some? What really goes on when world leaders speak at the UN? Can machines ever replace human translators, and if not, why? But the biggest question Bellos asks is this: How do we ever really know that we've understood what anybody else says in our own language or in another? Surprising, witty, and written with great joie de vivre, this book is all about how we comprehend other people and shows us how, ultimately, translation is another name for the human condition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J1WPippqeUsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clearwater","description":"Rightly called the saddest story in rock 'n' roll history, this Creedence biography--newly updated with stories from band members, producers, business associates, close friends, and families--recounts the tragic and triumphant tale of one of America's most beloved bands.

In a fast-paced style that is both technically sophisticated and admirably free of economic jargon, Eliana Cardoso and Ann Helwege provide a much-needed road map for a peaceful and productive transition from communism to capitalism. They vividly depict the tough choices Cuba faces in the years ahead, and propose a series of reforms to ease Cuba through a transition to capitalism while preserving some legitimate gains--such as those in education and health care--that socialism has provided the Cuban people. The authors begin with the crux of Cuba's predicament: it is an overly centralized single-crop economy that is fast running out of money, as it can no longer depend on privileged trade relations with the former Soviet Union. In this difficult period, Cuba faces the challenge of managing an increasingly chaotic, dysfunctional economy. Is Cuba's transition to capitalism bound to yield another Haiti? Cardoso and Helwege answer with a resounding no. They begin their analysis with a fascinating history of the political roots of Cuba, from Cuban \\"independence\\" after the Spanish-American War to the rise of Castro and the development of a socialist economy. After discussing the various economic alternatives reflected in the experience of neighboring countries--models as diverse as Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Chile--the authors present a systematic program to help Cuba prevent economic decline and political chaos. Their plan involves rapid privatization and the attraction offoreign investment, while providing safeguards against the excesses and inequalities endemic to Latin American capitalism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-0wQ3qHyZFwC&dq=Cuba+after+Communism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Husbandry: The Surest, Cheapest Way to Leisure, Plenty, Prosperity & Contentment, Plainly Illustrated","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yOpHAAAAYAAJ&dq=Husbandry:+The+Surest,+Cheapest+Way+to+Leisure,+Plenty,+Prosperity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Year of the Wild Boar: An American Woman in Japan.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NM7cngEACAAJ&dq=Year+of+the+Wild+Boar:+An+American+Woman+in+Japan.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Texan star: The story of a great fight for liberty","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Gathering never-before-published eyewitness accounts from Holocaust survivors, Michael Brenner presents a remarkable history of this period. While much has been written on the Holocaust itself, until now little has been known about the fate of those survivors who remained in Germany. Jews emerging from concentration camps would learn that most of their families had been murdered and their communities destroyed. Furthermore, all Jews in the country would face the stigma of living, as a 1948 resolution of the World Jewish Congress termed it, on \\"bloodsoaked German soil.\\" Brenner brings to life the psychological, spiritual, and material obstacles they surmounted as they rebuilt their lives in Germany. At the heart of his narrative is a series of fifteen interviews Brenner conducted with some of the most important witnesses who played an active role in the reconstruction--including presidents of Jewish communities, rabbis, and journalists. Based on the Yiddish and German press and unpublished archival material, the first part of this book provides a historical introduction to this fascinating topic. Here the author analyzes such diverse aspects as liberation from concentration camps, cultural and religious life among the Jewish Displaced Persons, antisemitism and philosemitism in post-war Germany, and the complex relationship between East European and German Jews. A second part consists of the fifteen interviews, conducted by Brenner, with witnesses representing the diverse background of the postwar Jewish community. While most of them were camp survivors, others returned from exile or came to Germany as soldiers of the Jewish Brigade or with international Jewish aid organizations. A third part, which covers the development of the Jewish community in Germany from the 1950s until today, concludes the book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iMkkEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cultural Hegemony in the United States (Feminist Perspective on Communication)","description":"This text is the first to present cultural hegemony in its original form - as a process of consent, resistance, and coercion.

Four years into the marriage, Henry dies, leaving England's throne to nine-year-old Edward--a puppet in the hands of ruthlessly ambitious royal courtiers--and Katharine's life takes a more complicated turn. Thrilled at this renewed opportunity to wed her first love, Katharine doesn't realize that Sir Thomas now sees her as a mere stepping stone to the throne, his eye actually set on bedding and wedding fourteen-year-old Elizabeth.

He draws ideas from three very useful intellectual pools: classical management practices, Agile methods, and lean product development. By combining the strengths of these three approaches, he has produced something that works better than any one in isolation.  From the Foreword by Don Reinertsen, President of Reinertsen & Associates; author of Managing the Design Factory; and leading expert on rapid product development Effective requirements discovery and analysis is a critical best practice for serious application development. Until now, however, requirements and Agile methods have rarely coexisted peacefully. For many enterprises considering Agile approaches, the absence of effective and scalable Agile requirements processes has been a showstopper for Agile adoption. In Agile Software Requirements, Dean Leffingwell shows exactly how to create effective requirements in Agile environments. Part I presents the  big picture  of Agile requirements in the enterprise, and describes an overall process model for Agile requirements at the project team, program, and portfolio levels Part II describes a simple and lightweight, yet comprehensive model that Agile project teams can use to manage requirements Part III shows how to develop Agile requirements for complex systems that require the cooperation of multiple teams Part IV guides enterprises in developing Agile requirements for ever-larger  systems of systems,  application suites, and product portfolios This book will help you leverage the benefits of Agile without sacrificing the value of effective requirements discovery and analysis.

They stayed for hours, turning over rooms, seizing documents, impounding computers, files and anything else that interested them. The family were treated as terrorist suspects, the operation resembling so many others in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. But Alan Barker was and is no terrorist. In fact, he has spent his adult life fighting terrorism on the streets of his native province. Barker belonged to the Special Branch, the RUC's elite unit dedicated to fighting the IRA, the INLA and loyalist terrorists. He gives a gripping insider's account of life on the frontline and demonstrates how the RUC used sophisticated listening devices and informants, including the notorious supergrass Raymond Gilmour, in their fight to gain the upper hand. After nearly 30 years of loyal service, Barker retired angry and disillusioned about what he views as the government's capitulation to the terrorists.

Halfway through the forest, the family stopped to rest and the mother needed to breast feed the younger daughter Yodit while the elder child Meme foraged for berries in the area. Their father, looking at his family and their thinning condition, became overcome with depression and slipping a thin bladed knife from out of his sleeve, he approached his wife from behind and then plunged the knife into her chest just below where the child was nursing. Surprised, she looked up at him with a questioning pain, then fell back onto the hardened earth and the small child fell to her side. He ran off into the forest just as the older child viewed her mother on the ground and ran to her to see just what had happened to her. They spent the night lying on her stiffening body and crying. The next morning they were awakened by the loud grunting coming from a large Boar that had smelled their mother's blood and was now approaching them in a very threatening way.That same morning, two hunters from out of Addis Ababa, were on a hunting trip to try and find enough food from their hunt to last their families through the long winter months. When they heard the Boar's loud grunting, they just knew that he was what they were looking for. When they approached the clearing where the lifeless body and two small children were, they couldn't believe their eyes. The large Boar was chasing the children round and round the lifeless body trying to catch and kill them. Instantly, the two hunters drew their sharp spears and threw them with determined accuracy towards the charging Boar. Both spears hit their determined mark and the Boar dropped to the ground dead ! The two mall children, seeing the hunters approaching them in the clearing, ran to them and the two men picked up each one and began comforting them in their big strong arms. Taking them down to a nearby creek, they gave them drinks of the refreshing water, wasked their mother's blod from off of each one and then opened their lunch packets and fed them until they could hold no mote. Then they removed their own warm jackets and wrapped each child into them and took them back into the area where their mothers corpse was. Placing them on a large pile of soft leaves, the men them wrapped their mother's body in a blanket from out of one of their packets, then dug a grave for her in the clearing, placed her gently within the depth of the opening and then began covering her with the soft earth from their labors. They made a crude cross from two branches and then drove it into the ground above her head. Then, placing the large Boars body on a sling they had also fashioned out of two larger twigs, they slit its throat and permitted its blood to drain out to make its carcass somewhat lighter, then secured it to the sling with two cowhide straps. They each took turns carrying the two children and pulling their prized food and trekking off back towards Addis Ababa. Arriving there, they were greeted with loud barking from their dogs and loud screams whenever their wives saw the two small children they were carrying. They made over and over the two beautiful girls as their husbands related all of their experiences with their mothers dead body and their killing of the Boar just in time to save the children. They cared for the girls for several weeks while preparations were being made to take them over to His Majesties Orphanage that was being managed by a Missionary from the United States. Each child grew up there in a wonderful Christian environment until they graduated from the school there. Yodit earned her way performing household chores for different families while Meme worked in a bar, dated and then married a Cuban soldier.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NAezAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Orphan+-+A+Portrait+of+Courage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tarantula (Sandman Mystery Theater, Book 1)","description":"NONE CAN ESCAPE THE SANDMAN?S DARK DREAMS The year is 1938, and the world is holding its breath?mesmerized by the onrushing storm that will soon engulf it in fire and steel. In New York City, one man?s sleep is filled with tormenting visions of the evils that mankind visits upon itself, compelling him to act. And so, by night, Wesley Dodds lays aside the trappings of his inherited wealth to roam the shadows as the Sandman, armed with a tranquilizing gas gun and driven by an unrelenting sense of justice. Haunted and obsessed, the Sandman moves through a decadent, post-Depression landscape, stalking the predators who hide themselves beneath society?s callous indifference to the weak and vulnerable. No one sees him at his work until he chooses to reveal himself?no one, that is, except the woman who is destined to be the light to his darkness. Written by comics legends Matt Wagner and Steven T.

Most significantly, it has been enlarged to two volumes. The first volume is intended for use in criminal procedure courses focusing primarily or exclusively on police investigatory process. Such courses are variously titled: Criminal Procedure I; Criminal Procedure: Investigation; Criminal Procedure: Police Practices; Constitutional Criminal Procedure; etc. Because some such courses also cover the defendant's right to counsel at trial and appeal, the first volume includes a chapter on this non-police-practice issue. (The latter chapter is also included in Volume Two.) The second volume of Understanding Criminal Procedure covers the criminal process after the police investigation ends, and the adjudicative process commences. This book is useful in criminal procedure courses (variously entitled Criminal Procedure II; Criminal Procedure: Adjudication; etc.) that follow the criminal process through the various stages of adjudication, commencing with pretrial issues   such as charging, pretrial release and discovery   and continuing with the trial itself and then post-conviction proceedings: sentencing and appeals. Understanding Criminal Procedure is primarily designed for law students. The authors have written the Text so that students can use it with confidence that it will assist them in course preparation, and professors can recommend or assign the volumes to students with confidence that they will improve classroom dialogue. Based on comments that the authors received in the past from students and professors alike, they predict that this new, expanded edition of Understanding Criminal Procedure will serve the needs of students and professors even better. Also, based on the experience of prior editions, including citations to this Text in scholarly literature and judicial opinions, we are confident that the two volumes will prove useful to scholars, practicing lawyers, and courts. Understanding Criminal Procedure covers the most important United States Supreme Court cases in the field. Where pertinent, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, federal statutes, and lower federal and state court cases are considered. The broad overarching policy issues of criminal procedure are laid out; and some of the hottest debates in the field are considered in depth and, we think, objectively. Readers should find the Text user-friendly. Students who want a thorough grasp of a topic can and should read the relevant chapter in its entirety. However, each chapter is divided into subsections, so that readers with more refined research needs can find answers to their questions efficiently. The authors also include citations to important scholarship, both classic and recent, into which readers may delve more deeply regarding specific topics. And, because so many of the topics interrelate, cross-referencing footnotes are included, so that readers can easily move from one part of the Text to another, if necessary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yz7IoboSxJoC&dq=Understanding+Criminal+Procedure+(Legal+Text+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Through the Night (Grace Livingston Hill #6)","description":"Dale struggles to face the challenges that come after her grandmother's death in the latest tale from Hill, author of more than 100 wholesome books about adventure, romance, and the heartwarming triumphs of people faced with the problems of life and love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1bc8w6cJ5F4C&dq=All+Through+the+Night+(Grace+Livingston+Hill&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sheep Hb","description":"Five breeds of sheep (Columbia, Targhee, Rambouillet, Lincoln, and Suffolk) were found to possess two hemoglobin types (Hb. A and Hb. B) when their hemoglobins were examined by disc gel electrophoresis. The hemoglobin alleles proved to be co-dominant. Three of the breeds (Columbia, Targhee, and Rambouillet) were maintained at altitudes of 4,800 to 7,500 feet above sea level and the Lincoln breed investigated was maintained at altitudes of 750 to 1,200 feet above sea level. These four breeds had a frequency of Hb. A of 16% or greater. The Suffolk flock maintained at an altitude of 250 feet above sea level had a frequency of Hb. A of approximately 5%. These data suggest an adaptive advantage for Hb. A at higher altitudes. An increase in inbreeding was observed to be associated with an increase in the homozygosity at the hemoglobin locus. The association was linear to a level of 35% inbreeding after which there was a noticeable drop in the amount of homozygosity as inbreeding exceeded 35%. There were no significant differences among the means of production traits for the three classes of hemoglobin alleles when the mean values of the following production traits were tested: (1) average daily gain from birth to weaning, (2) weaning weight, (3) weaning conformation, (4) weaning condition, (5) weaning index, (6) yearling weight, (7) average daily gain from weaning to yearling, (8) yearling condition, (9) yearling conformation, (10) yearling grease fleece weight, (11) yearling fleece grade, and (12) yearling index.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yU_yHAAACAAJ&dq=Sheep+Hb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Canada","description":"Presents a concise history of Canada, from the time of early exploration by Europeans to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CFWy0EfzlX0C&dq=A+Brief+History+of+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Proposed notional principal contract regs. address contingent payments and character.: An article from: The Tax Adviser","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2CA5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Proposed+notional+principal+contract+regs.+address+contingent+payments+and+character.:+An+article+from:+The+Tax+Adviser&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kill the Indian, Save the Man","description":"For five consecutive generations, from roughly 1880 to 1980, Native American children in the United States and Canada were forcibly taken from their families and relocated to residential schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l-CTQgAACAAJ&dq=Kill+the+Indian,+Save+the+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love My Papi!

Lu Ann Jones tells quite a different story in Mama Learned Us to Work. Building upon evocative oral histories, she encourages us to understand these women as consumers, producers, and agents of economic and cultural change. As consumers, farm women bargained with peddlers at their backdoors. A key business for many farm women was the \\"butter and egg trade--small-scale dairying and raising chickens. Their earnings provided a crucial margin of economic safety for many families during the 1920s and 1930s and offered women some independence from their men folks. These innovative women showed that poultry production paid off and laid the foundation for the agribusiness poultry industry that emerged after World War II. Jones also examines the relationships between farm women and home demonstration agents and the effect of government-sponsored rural reform. She discusses the professional culture that developed among white agents as they reconciled new and old ideas about women's roles and shows that black agents, despite prejudice, linked their clients to valuable government resources and gave new meanings to traditions of self-help, mutual aid, and racial uplift.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8gTlHwPoIfQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mans Country?: The Image of the Pakeha Male: a History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=701BAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mans+Country%3F:+The+Image+of+the+Pakeha+Male:+a+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Coloring Book of Civil War Heroines","description":"Ready-to-color illustrations depict thirty famous women of the Civil War with informative captions highlighting their roles and accomplishments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wfiZtREXUzgC&dq=A+Coloring+Book+of+Civil+War+Heroines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Board Simulator Series: Body Systems Review I: Hematopoietic/Lymphoreticular, Respiratory, Cardiovascular","description":"By simulating the USMLE Step 1, the Board Simulator Series furnishes the most complete and accurate review possible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PNTQwAEACAAJ&dq=Board+Simulator+Series:+Body+Systems+Review+I:+Hematopoietic/Lymphoreticular,+Respiratory,+Cardiovascular&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nature of Narrative","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yZBLxgEACAAJ&dq=The+Nature+of+Narrative&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cry, the Beloved Country (Alan Paton Reads)","description":"A novel depicting the racial ferment in the beautiful country of South Africa in 1948.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNjyAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cry,+the+Beloved+Country+(Alan+Paton+Reads)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting an Ebay Business for Dummies","description":"Explains how to use eBay to start an online business, discussing product acquisition, auction management tools, shipping options, legal and tax issues, and record-keeping.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XryIDwAAQBAJ&dq=Starting+an+Ebay+Business+for+Dummies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Publish and Perish","description":"A New York Times Notable Book of the Year A Publisher's Weekly Best Book of the Year Combining the wit of David Lodge with Poe's delicious sense of the macabre, these are three witty, spooky novellas of satire set in academia a world where Derrida rules, love is a \\"complicated ideological position,\\" and poetic justice is served with an ideological twist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X1t9BE42bhkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Touch of the Master's Hand (Topical Bible Study Series, Life Lessons With Max Lucado)","description":"Challenging topical Bible study based on Max Lucado's bestselling book Just Like Jesus.

Yet it's not enough for individual leaders, managers, and employees to demonstrate personal competencies. Rather, an entire organization must be unified to create a culture of competence. This culture can then be passed along to succeeding generations of employees who will continue to contribute to, and strengthen, a company's future. In Creating a Culture of Competence, Michael Zwell provides a bold, prescriptive approach to achieving organizational success through improved individual and group job performance and satisfaction. He clearly defines those core qualities that lead to peak performance, then illustrates, step-by-step, how companies can identify and develop individual leadership, managerial, and employee competencies for maximum personal and organizational benefit. Based on years of personal experience and research, Creating a Culture of Competence expertly combines behavioral theory with solid business practice to create positive organizational change. You'll discover how to: * Use vision and competencies for cultural transformation * Create competency models * Implement competencies in selection and performance management You'll learn what really makes an organization successful . . . understand how HR's role is becoming central to building a high-performance organization . . . find out what technologies are being used to change corporate culture . . . then combine these elements to create a highly effective, competency-based organizational strategy. Creating a Culture of Competence offers a blueprint for hiring, developing, and retaining a superior workforce. By encouraging individuals to realize their potential, then motivating them to work in concert, you can lead your organization to reach its objectives . . . and get superior business results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJAoAQAAMAAJ&dq=Creating+a+Culture+of+Competence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Central Bank Strategy, Credibility, and Independence: Theory and Evidence","description":"Alex Cukierman is well known for his work on central bank behavior. This book brings together a large body of Cukierman's research and integrates it with recent developments in the political economy of monetary policy. Filled with applications and carefully worked out technical detail, it provides a valuable comprehensive analysis of central bank decisions, of the various effects of policy on inflation, and of the feedback from inflationary expectations to policy choices. Cukierman uncovers and analyzes the reasons for positive inflation and rates of monetary expansion. He shows that the money supply, and therefore inflation, are not exogenous. They are influenced by interactions involving distributional considerations, private information, personal motives, and the political environment. This point of view makes it possible to identify the institutional, political, and other features of a country that may be conducive to inflationary environments. Cukierman presents new multidimensional evidence on both legal and actual central bank independence for a sample of up to 70 countries and uses it to investigate the interconnections between the distributions of inflation and of central bank independence. He takes up such issues as why some countries have more independent central banks than others and identifies reasons for the substantial cross country variation in seigniorage. He provides positive explanations for the tendency of central banks, like the US Federal Reserve, to smooth interest rates and to be secretive. Observing that it is likely that the European Economic Community will have a monetary union before the turn of the century, Cukierman applies the techniques of modern political economy to discuss the effect of this change on the commitment to price stability. The book includes simple and advanced materials as well as informal summaries of the major technical results. The introduction contains a modular guide for reading and teaching the material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d_DCSUmzLIkC&dq=Central+Bank+Strategy,+Credibility,+and+Independence:+Theory+and+Evidence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"T. S. Eliot and the Cultural Divide","description":"The modernist poet T. S. Eliot has been applauded and denounced for decades as a staunch champion of high art and an implacable opponent of popular culture. But Eliot's elitism was never what it seemed. T. S. Eliot and the Cultural Divide refurbishes this great writer for the twenty-first century, presenting him as the complex figure he was, an artist attentive not only to literature but to detective fiction, vaudeville theater, jazz, and the songs of Tin Pan Alley. David Chinitz argues that Eliot was productively engaged with popular culture in some form at every stage of his career, and that his response to it, as expressed in his poetry, plays, and essays, was ambivalent rather than hostile. He shows that American jazz, for example, was a major influence on Eliot's poetry during its maturation. He discusses Eliot's surprisingly persistent interest in popular culture both in such famous works as The Waste Land and in such lesser-known pieces as Sweeney Agonistes. And he traces Eliot's long, quixotic struggle to close the widening gap between high art and popular culture through a new type of public art: contemporary popular verse drama. What results is a work that will persuade adherents and detractors alike to return to Eliot and find in him a writer who liked a good show, a good thriller, and a good tune, as well as a \\"great\\" poem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z-G1zjPAWIwC&dq=T.+S.+Eliot+and+the+Cultural+Divide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy of the Buddha: An Introduction","description":"Philosophy of the Buddha is a philosophical introduction to the teaching of the Buddha.

The world's most incredible motorcycles are given the artful representation they deserve. The motorcycle should have disappeared with the advent of the inexpensive automobile, since Henry Ford's Model T usurped the motorcycle's position as a primary form of utilitarian transportation, but a funny thing happened on the way to extinction - the motorcycle not only survived but thrived. Enough people were enamored of the thrill and beauty of the two-wheeled mechanical beast to ensure it would continue to exist indefinitely. And exist they have! Many of the motorcycles manufactured over the past century truly fit the description of \\"classic,\\" and many consider these machines works of art. Written by noted motorcycle author Patrick Hahn, Classic Motorcycles presents the history of motorcycling as told through the most significant, iconic, classic motorcycles of all time, with both period photography and modern portrait photography. All the best domestic and international makes are represented here, from BMWs, Indians, and Triumphs to Vincents, Ducatis, and Harley-Davidsons - the most classic models. You'll drool over the 1933 Matchless Silver Hawk. Each motorcycle was shot in a studio setting using photographer Tom Loeser's light-painting technique.

Battle Cry of Freedom, his Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the Civil War, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, in The New York Times Book Review, called \\"history writing of the highest order.\\" In that volume, McPherson gathered in the broad sweep of events, the political, social, and cultural forces at work during the Civil War era. Now, in Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution, he offers a series of thoughtful and engaging essays on aspects of Lincoln and the war that have rarely been discussed in depth. McPherson again displays his keen insight and sterling prose as he examines several critical themes in American history. He looks closely at the President's role as Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, showing how Lincoln forged a national military strategy for victory. He explores the importance of Lincoln's great rhetorical skills, uncovering how--through parables and figurative language--he was uniquely able to communicate both the purpose of the war and a new meaning of liberty to the people of the North. In another section, McPherson examines the Civil War as a Second American Revolution, describing how the Republican Congress elected in 1860 passed an astonishing blitz of new laws (rivaling the first hundred days of the New Deal), and how the war not only destroyed the social structure of the old South, but radically altered the balance of power in America, ending 70 years of Southern power in the national government. The Civil War was the single most transforming and defining experience in American history, and Abraham Lincoln remains the most important figure in the pantheon of our mythology. These graceful essays, written by one of America's leading historians, offer fresh and unusual perspectives on both.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tYdpAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Board Simulator Series: Body Systems Review II: Gastrointestinal, Renal, Reproductive, Endocrine","description":"One of a series of five texts that creates a body systems-based review that matches the current blueprint of the USMLE Step 1.

Creativity is basic to the very fiber of our being, and not--as many suspect--solely the privilege of a gifted few. When we silence the voice of creativity that lives within us, we confine our spirit. Award-winning author Dan Wakefield helps us to examine our reasons for not creating--debunking the myths--and shows us the path to a fulfilling, creative life. Drawing on examples from religion, philosophy, and literature, Wakefield teaches us that the key to unleashing our own inner creativity is in clarity of mind, body, and spirit. Releasing the Creative Spirit gives us practical guidance to demystify the creative process and to help each of us achieve this clarity by: Breaking the Myths--Explode the myths that creativity is only for the artistic elite, that creators must suffer, and that science and business can not be creative pursuits. Emptying--Learn ways to recognize and move beyond the tired routines in your life that deaden the senses and soul. Filling Up--Experience new sensations through simple practices that revive natural perceptions and unlock hidden creative resources. Creating--Try hands-on, practical exercises to explore the mystery of creativity in your life from a spiritual perspective. This passionate, personal guide draws on examples from the experiences of many creative people--Elaine Pagels (professor), Tom Wolfe (novelist), John Coltrane (jazz musician), Harold Kushner (rabbi), Danielle Levi-Alvares (yoga teacher), Stephen Hawking (physicist), and Phil Jackson (basketball coach), just to name a few--who each demonstrate one or more of the characteristics of someone who creates from the spirit. Creative People... Develop clarity as the source of creativity Take responsibility for their lives and work Regard age as an opportunity See obstacles as an invitation to create new solutions, techniques, and skills Recognize the body/mind/spirit connection Find surprising new ways to perform routine tasks ...and much more This fresh exploration of the creative spirit includes hands-on exercises to help you unlock your creative powers, inviting you to experience the artistic grace and pleasure that can exist in our everyday lives. You may discover, as many others have, that with creativity comes more joy, more laughter, and more accomplishment than you previously thought possible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OK4FAAAACAAJ&dq=Releasing+the+Creative+Spirit+:+Unleashing+the+Creativity+in+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of Sapphire Dreams","description":"When Gabriella reunites a lost boy with his father, Adam Drake, Earl of Lancaster, insists on rewarding her with a London Season.

Collier's Magazine of March 24,1934, ranked Mr. Watson as No. 4 player. Ely Culbertson considered Mr. Watson \\"among two or three authorities really qualified to write on Bridge, because he is a master player, a great analyst and a fine writer-all in one.\\" For many years Mr. Watson was closely associated with Mr. Culbertson as, Technical Editor of The Bridge World Magazine. As Bridge Editor of The New York Post, Mr. Watson wrote daily for this newspaper and associated newspapers. The Post said: \\"Even more than for his skill, and his Bridge trail-blazing, Mr. Watson deserves a special niche among Bridge masters. For he is a Bridge expert who can also write. He can make the most complex and critical Bridge situation as clear as simple honors.\\" MR.

Phillips Oppenheim. A tale of international espionage, we follow criminal Jocelyn Thew as he escapes capture accompanied by a mysterious dying man and the young Katherine Beverley, indebted to Thew for saving her brothers life some years before. Crawshay of the British Secret Service is on their tail however and is never far behind. Will the law catch up with the fleeing trio? E. Phillips Oppenheim (1866-1946) was a hugely prolific and highly popular British author of novels and short stories. Born in Tottenham, London, Oppenheim left school as a teenager and worked for his leather-merchant father for 20 years prior to launching his literary career. Oppenheim published five novels under the pseudonym  Anthony Partridge  before establishing his reputation as a writer under his own name. An internationally successful author, Oppenheim s stories revolved mainly around glamourous characters, luxurious settings, and themes of espionage, suspense, and crime. He is widely regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of the thriller and spy-fiction genre as it is recognised today. Oppenheim s incredible literary success meant that his own life soon began to mirror that of his opulent characters. He held lavish, Gatsby-style parties at his French Villa and was rumoured to have had frequent love affairs aboard his luxury yacht. Oppenheim s success earned him the cover of Time magazine in 1927. Some of his most well-known novels include  The Great Impersonation ,  The Long Arm of Mannister  and  The Moving Finger .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XOxGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange / Honey for the Bears","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ecaHtAEACAAJ&dq=A+Clockwork+Orange+/+Honey+for+the+Bears&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Japan (Great ages of man; a history of the world's cultures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aHrpwQEACAAJ&dq=Early+Japan+(Great+ages+of+man%3B+a+history+of+the+world%27s+cultures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apartment Stories: City and Home in Nineteenth-Century Paris and London","description":"In urban studies, the nineteenth century is the \\"age of great cities.\\" In feminist studies, it is the era of the separate domestic sphere. But what of the city's homes? In the course of answering this question, Apartment Stories provides a singular and radically new framework for understanding the urban and the domestic. Turning to an element of the cityscape that is thoroughly familiar yet frequently overlooked, Sharon Marcus argues that the apartment house embodied the intersections of city and home, public and private, and masculine and feminine spheres. Moving deftly from novels to architectural treatises, legal debates, and popular urban observation, Marcus compares the representation of the apartment house in Paris and London. Along the way, she excavates the urban ghost tales that encoded Londoners' ambivalence about city dwellings; contends that Haussmannization enclosed Paris in a new regime of privacy; and locates a female counterpart to the flaneur and the omniscient realist narrator the porti re who supervised the apartment building.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_T3EA_m5CPgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The parasite: A story","description":"March 24. The spring is fairly with us now. Outside my laboratory window the great chestnut-tree is all covered with the big, glutinous, gummy buds, some of which have already begun to break into little green shuttlecocks. As you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere. The twigs are stiff with their sap; and the moist, heavy English air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume. Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them-everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! I can see it without, and I can feel it within. We also have our spring when the little arterioles dilate, the lymph flows in a brisker stream, the glands work harder, winnowing and straining. Every year nature readjusts the whole machine. I can feel the ferment in my blood at this very moment, and as the cool sunshine pours through my window I could dance about in it like a gnat. So I should, only that Charles Sadler would rush upstairs to know what was the matter. Besides, I must remember that I am Professor Gilroy.

Pilot John Murray didn t have long before the plane crashed headlong into the 20-foot waves at 120 mph. As the four flight attendants donned life vests, collected sharp objects, and explained how to brace for the ferocious impact, 68 passengers clung to their seats: elementary schoolchildren from Hawaii, a teenage newlywed from Germany, a disabled Normandy vet from Cape Cod, an immigrant from Mexico, and 30 recent graduates of the 82nd Airborne s Jump School. They all expected to die. Murray radioed out  Mayday  as he attempted to fly down through gale-force winds into the rough water, hoping the plane didn t break apart when it hit the sea. Only a handful of ships could pick up the distress call so far from land. The closest was a Swiss freighter 13 hours away. Dozens of other ships and planes from 9 countries abruptly changed course or scrambled from Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Scotland, and Cornwall, all racing to the rescue but they would take hours, or days, to arrive. From the cockpit, the blackness of the Atlantic grew ever closer. Could Murray do what no pilot had ever done  land  a commercial airliner at night in a violent sea without everyone dying? And if he did, would rescuers find any survivors before they drowned or died from hypothermia in the icy water? The fate of Flying Tiger 923 riveted the world. Bulletins interrupted radio and TV programs. Headlines shouted off newspapers from London to LA. Frantic family members overwhelmed telephone switchboards. President Kennedy took a break from the brewing crises in Cuba and Mississippi to ask for hourly updates. Tiger in the Sea is a gripping tale of triumph, tragedy, unparalleled airmanship, and incredibly brave people from all walks of life. The author has pieced together the story long hidden because of murky Cold War politics through exhaustive research and reconstructed a true and inspiring tribute to the virtues of outside-the-box-thinking, teamwork, and hope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K_MeEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beloved Enemy: Battle of First Bull Run (Battles of Destiny #3)","description":"Dramatic Tales of Love and Civil War The Battles of Destiny series is now available in four attractive two-in-one volumes!

Story Behind the Book  While studying American history in high school, I was struck with a strange fascination for the Civil War. That fascination grew stronger when I studied it again in college, and I ve visited many of the sites where the battles took place. When I visited the Appomattox Court House in Virginia , where General Robert E. Lee signed the documents of surrender before General Ulysses S. Grant, I was struck with the thought of creating a series of novels based upon specific battles in the Civil War. I wanted to mold fictional characters with real ones and fill the stories with romance, suspense, intrigue, and the excitement of battle. That s how the Battles of Destiny series came to be.

Kirby Olson posits that no one has been more marginalized than the comic writer, whose irreverent truths have always made others uncomfortable. In a literary age that purports to champion diversity, comic writers remain an underclass huddling at the fringes of the canon. Olson challenges the status quo by inviting the comic writer into the center of literary debate. In the growing discipline of humor studies, Olson is the first to create a substantial link between the fields of comedy and postmodernism, discovering in comic writers a philosophy of oddness and paradox that parallels and extends the work of the major postmodern thinkers. With elegant clarity, Comedy After Post-modernism examines: Edward Lear as he invents a comic picturesque to challenge the sublime of Kant and Ruskin Gregory Corso as he explodes the Great Chain of Being of his early Catholicism Philippe Soupault as a comic surrealist undoing the sacrificial aesthetics of Andr  Breton P.G. Wodehouse as a social thinker with surprisingly deep affinities to anarchist Peter Kropotkin and radical social theorist Charles Fourier Stewart Home, the infamously violent punk author, as a pacifist whose narrative questions Marxist-anarchist terrorism in favor of patience and tolerance Charles Willeford, the maestro of the black humor police procedural, as a postmodern philosopher who deepens the problems of ethical and aesthetic judgment after postmodernism. \\"An original, splendidly researched, and necessary book. By pointing to the vast excluded literature of 'comic writers, ' Dr. Olson opens the door to a postmodern scholarship capable of greater flexibility. Comedy After Postmodernism evinces a lucid, passionate, and engaging style.\\" --Andrei Codrescu There was an old man on the Border, Who lived in the utmost disorder; He danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat, Which vexed all the folks on the Border. --From The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fnoDktslXVcC&dq=Comedy+after+Postmodernism:+Rereading+Comedy+from+Edward+Lear+to+Charles+Willeford&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Contemporary Interpretation","description":"This unique single-volume edition explores current issues in the interpretation of the Bible from the perspective of specific academic disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=soSds4UaGIwC&dq=Foundations+of+Contemporary+Interpretation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"School, Family, And Community Partnerships: Preparing Educators And Improving Schools","description":"School, Family, and Community Partnerships: Preparing Educators and Improving Schools addresses a fundamental question in education today: How will colleges and universities prepare future teachers, administrators, counselors, and other education professionals to conduct effective programs of family and community involvement that contribute to students' success in school?

Investigative writer William Blum describes the grim role played by the Agency in overthrowing governments, preventing elections, assassinating leaders, suppressing revolutions, manipulating trade unions and manufacturing 'news' -- in detail that's never before appeared in one book. Blum also shows how the mainstream media have frequently not bothered to probe, highlight or even report many of America's aggressive actions abroad. Effectively, this has helped the US Government camoflague its operations and intentions abroad ever since World War II. Washington's deception and the media's laxity combine to leave us functionally illiterate about the history of modern US foreign policy. And that, the author believes, is good neither for democracy, nor for development and world peace. This immensely readable account has been carefully pieced together from widely disparate sources and with a scrupulous eye to documentation.\\" --","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NqgHAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+CIA:+A+Forgotten+History+:+Us+Global+Interventions+Since+World+War+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The \\"Snoopy, come home\\" movie book","description":"All the Peanuts characters appear in this saga of a sick little girl who wants Snoopy to leave Charlie Brown and go to live with her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RsVpAAAACAAJ&dq=The+%22Snoopy,+come+home%22+movie+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronic Information Display Technologies (World Scientific Series on Information Display, 3)","description":"This book is a comprehensive review of the present state and future prospects of the displays used in entertainment television sets and in data terminals and personal computers. Such a treatment was deemed necessary because of the importance of displays in possible future communications services incorporating computer graphics and video. A few main conclusions are drawn. One is that modest-sized flat-panel displays will become commonplace where space is at a premium, such as on desktops and in kitchens or bedrooms. It is another matter to stretch these displays to several feet on a side, however. For the next five to ten years, these larger displays will mostly rely on optical projection. Thereafter, plasma techniques could well make large-area, flat-panel TV displays affordable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aGmhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What is Sufism? (Islamic Texts Society)","description":"Martin Lings provides an excellent and authoritative introduction to the mystical movement of the Sufis based on his lifelong interest in Islamic culture. His explanation derives from a profound understanding of Sufism, and extends to many aspects which are usually neglected. His illuminating answer to 'What is Sufism?' gives a taste of the very subject matter itself. What do Sufis believe? What do they aim at? What do they do? Unlike other writers on the subject, Martin Lings treats all the three questions with equal justice. He is thus able to give a wealth of answers to the main question 'What is Sufism?', each answer being from a different angle but all going to the root of the matter. A reviewer wrote 'Should the book appear in paperback, I would use it for undergraduate and graduate courses on Islamic civilization', and in fact What is Sufism? has become a set book in colleges and universities on both sides of the Atlantic. It is now accepted as the authoritative statement on the subject of Sufism and it has been translated into French, German, Italian and Spanish. It has also been published in Sarajevo in Bosnian, and is available in Braille.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rgOFkgEACAAJ&dq=What+is+Sufism%3F+(Islamic+Texts+Society)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a Lady's Man","description":"To mark the publication of Leonard Cohen's final book, The Flame, McClelland & Stewart is proud to reissue six beautiful editions of Cohen's cherished early works of poetry, many of which are back in print for the first time in decades.

Second language acquisition is perceived as the study of the relationship between input, intake and output in a particular task performance, and Indian classrooms are the context for the research studies in this book. The empirical studies discussed in this book are based on two tasks: seminar speech task (SST) and written test performance task (WTPT). The pedagogical practices discussed cover three specific areas: tasks, skills, and strategies. The study focuses on text input processing for written versus spoken tasks, at various levels of task performance, and for language versus information. The authors discuss, among other issues, various elements of second language speech production, teachers  evaluation of communicative versus form-focused tasks, and task-based versus proficiency-based performance. As a study located in multilingual and mixed ability classrooms, this work provides immense insights to teacher-educators and researchers working in ESL settings with learners from diverse backgrounds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wMPsDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Reading Guide to \\"Where the Red Fern Grows\\"","description":"A beloved classic that captures the powerful bond between man and man s best friend.

Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch  rule , 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We've Got Spirit: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Cheerleading Team","description":"A portrait of competitive cheerleading explores how this combination of graceful gymnastics, dance, and beauty became a sport in its own right and how the Kentucky Greenup County Musketeers have dominated the national championships","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FVrj5LzU9okC&dq=We%27ve+Got+Spirit:+The+Life+and+Times+of+America%27s+Greatest+Cheerleading+Team&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ford Falcon Story: An Illustrated History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ndU6AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Ford+Falcon+Story:+An+Illustrated+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Straight Man","description":"Hilarious and true-to-life, witty, compassionate, and impossible to put down, Straight Man follows Hank Devereaux through one very bad week in this novel from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo. William Henry Devereaux, Jr., is the reluctant chairman of the English department of a badly underfunded college in the Pennsylvania rust belt. Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist--and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans. In the course of a single week, Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague, imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean, wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits, and threaten to execute a goose on local television. All this while coming to terms with his philandering father, the dereliction of his youthful promise, and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions. In short, Straight Man is classic Russo side-splitting, poignant, compassionate, and unforgettable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LK1VJHw8gOgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wyoming (Wagon's West)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gcd8tAEACAAJ&dq=Wyoming+(Wagon%27s+West)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clifford's ABC","description":"Clifford tells the children what words begin with a particular letter of the alphabet.

Jett examines why peacekeeping operations fail by comparing the unsuccessful attempt at peacekeeping in Angola with the successful effort in Mozambique, alongside a wide range of other peacekeeping experiences. The book argues that while the causes of past peacekeeping failures can be identified, the chances for success will be difficult to improve because of the way such operations are initiated and conducted, and the way the United Nations operates as an organization. Jett reviews the history of peacekeeping and the evolution in the number, size, scope, and cost of peacekeeping missions. He also explains why peacekeeping has become more necessary, possible, and desired and yet, at the same time, more complex, more difficult, and less frequently used. The book takes a hard look at the UN's actions and provides useful information for understanding current conflicts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4gJfCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A problem book in mathematical analysis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bEBNPgAACAAJ&dq=A+problem+book+in+mathematical+analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Potential Military Chemical/Biological Agents and Compounds","description":"The standard reference manual on chemical and biological warfare agents for the US Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force.

That's what Cinnamon Browne found out as she searched for true love after she and her childhood boyfriend \\"Chunky\\" parted ways. It all started at the tender age of 13 in the suburbs of Miami, Florida. That's when Cinnamon and Chunky were struck by Cupid's arrow. It was love at first sight. Throughout junior and senior high school, the two lovebirds experienced sexuality and the growing pains of adolescence. What seemed like puppy love back then was just the beginning of a relationship that created a life-long bond. In 1982, Cinnamon was a budding journalist and Chunky, a promising athlete. They were both destined for greatness. But, their anticipated success came with a price tag. When sports anchors reported that Chunky was slated as a first-round draft pick for the New York Grizzlies football team, the television news stories and headlines attracted more than just fame. Cinnamon soon found that her best friend was plotting to steal Chunky's affection. Chunky's family, who once thought of Cinnamon as his ideal soulmate, soon labeled her a golddigger. With the added pressures of stardom, Cinnamon felt squeezed out of Chunky's life. When Chunky signed a $2 million contract and moved to New York, his over-protective family, the long distance and a host of other factors made Cinnamon face the reality that Chunky was slipping away. After Cinnamon and Chunky went their separate ways, Cinnamon did everything possible to get Chunky out of her mind. Over a 10-year period, Cinnamon was in and out of relationships. One particular guy seemed like a promising candidate for matrimony until Cinnamon found out that he was sleeping with his bi-sexual sister. When that relationship ended, Cinnamon began dating an architect nicknamed \\"Dr. Freak.\\" Although Cinnamon thought that his nickname was a bit peculiar, she didn't realize just how bizarre his name was until he showered her with love in his own freaky way. Cinnamon searched and searched for Mr. Right. After years of failed relationships, Cinnamon longed for the kind of twosome that she and Chunky once shared. Determined to love again, Cinnamon set out to get back her first true love. As luck would have it, Cinnamon was a day late and a dollar short. There was another woman waiting to hook Chunky. It was the woman who bore his first child. That woman bragged to Chunky's sister and friends that she had him trapped. Even though she knew Chunky still had feelings for Cinnamon, she and her family put on a full-court press to get Chunky to marry her. Although Chunky vowed he'd never tie the knot with her, they married anyway. Crushed, broken-hearted and distraught, Cinnamon still forged ahead to claim her long-lost beau. Cinnamon strategized, planned and targeted Chunky's heart. She poured on the charm. She sent Chunky love letters and wrote him heart-felt poems. In a decorative bag, Cinnamon sent Chunky a bottle of Heineken Beer with a note that read, \\"Show me your Heiny, I'll show you mine.\\" She even sent him a box of candy canes with a message that read, \\"Lick these until you get a chance to lick me.\\" Cinnamon put on her game face and was winning this love war. After sending Chunky more than a dozen sexy, sensitive and suggestive gifts, Cinnamon was soon standing at the entrance ramp that led to Chunky's heart. Can she reel him in? Who knows? Pick up a copy of this book and see if she reunites with her first love, or if we'll always find Cinnamon Browne: Waiting on Love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pPaoOQAACAAJ&dq=Cinnamon+Browne:+Waiting+on+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"in pictures Sequoia-Kings Canyon: The Continuing Story","description":"Explore the realm of the giant sequoias, the largets living things on Earth, the magnet that caused these two national Parks to be set aside a century ago.

These modern forms are presented in tandem with and in relation to tried-and-true, traditional screenwriting forms, rendering unconventional structures as easily grasped as conventional ones. Unlike any other screenwriting book, this book combines solid, basic screenwriting craft with a thorough presentation of very contemporary script structures.

A rigorous, exacting researcher with an eye for telling drama, Reynolds is no armchair theoretician or chronicler of the minutes of High Command. He scrutinizes battles as they actually occurred - maelstroms of firepower, courage and flesh in which superior strength and combat skills were the sole, unvarnished factors in success.MEN OF STEEL follows Germany's largest remaining elite formation, 1 SS Panzer Corps, during the last five months of the World War II in Europe. Threatened with massive invasions from both the East and the West, in the last days of the Third Reich, Hitler opted to counter-attack. In December 1944 the Germans launched a last desperate offensive in the west, 1 SS Panzer Corps its cutting edge through the Ardennes in what became the greatest American battle since Gettysburg. After Anglo-American armies under Braadley, Patton and Montgomery had sealed off the Ardennes breakthrough, the panzer corps was transferred to mount an attack against the onrushing Soviets in the East. At Lake Balaton the 1 SS Panzer Corps waded into vastly superior Red Army forces in what became the last German offensive of the war.On both fronts the panzers were finally overwhelmed and the victors exulted in the annihilation of Nazi Germany. By examining in thorough detail the final death throes of Hitler's elite combat formations, Reynolds vividly illustrates the price of Allied victory, and why it was so difficult to achieve. Michael Reynolds retired from the British Army with the rank of Major General in 1986. His last command was NATO's International Mobile Force, and he subsequently became Director of its Military Plans and Policy Commission. His previous two books, The Devil's Adjutant (1995) and Steel Inferno (1997) were released to international acclaim.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ghbtAEACAAJ&dq=Men+of+Steel+I+SS+Panzer+Corps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aiaa Guide for the Verification and Validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations","description":"This document presents for guidelines for assessing the credibility of modeling and simulation in computational fluid dynamics. The two main principles that are necessary for assessing credibility are verification and validation. Verification is the process of determining if a computational simulation accurately represents the conceptual model, but no claim is made of the relationship of the simulation to the real world. Validation is the process of determining if a computational simulation represents the real world. This document defines a number of key terms, discusses fundamental concepts, and specifies general procedures for conducting verification and validation of computational fluid dynamics simulations. The document's goal is to provide a foundation for the major issues and concepts in verification and validation. However, this document does not recommend standards in these areas because a number of important issues are not yet resolved. It is hoped that the guidelines will aid in the research, development, and use of computational fluid dynamics simulations by establishing common terminology and methodology for verification and validation. The terminology and methodology should also be useful in other engineering and science disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OUAHAAAACAAJ&dq=Aiaa+Guide+for+the+Verification+and+Validation+of+Computational+Fluid+Dynamics+Simulations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A-Z of Wool Embroidery","description":"Part of the bestselling A-Z series, this title explores the handiest stitches and techniques for use in the practice of wool embroidery.Clear step-by-step instructions lead the reader through the stitches themselves; and beautiful designs created by readers of Inspirations magazines in Australia aid the reader in putting the techniques into practice.A great accompaniment and follow-on to the A-Z of Embroidery Stitches.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gE-_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Wars X-wing: A pocket manual","description":"A guide to more than 50 collectible Barbies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EwUJAAAACAAJ&dq=Star+Wars+X-wing:+A+pocket+manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essence of Lilacs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NC_0nQEACAAJ&dq=Essence+of+Lilacs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete estate planning guide (Mentor executive library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5llWuAAACAAJ&dq=The+complete+estate+planning+guide+(Mentor+executive+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Earth and Sky","description":"In Amanda Skenandore s provocative and profoundly moving debut, set in the tragic intersection between white and Native American culture, a young girl learns about friendship, betrayal, and the sacrifices made in the name of belonging. On a quiet Philadelphia morning in 1906, a newspaper headline catapults Alma Mitchell back to her past. A federal agent is dead, and the murder suspect is Alma s childhood friend, Harry Muskrat. Harry or Asku, as Alma knew him was the most promising student at the  savage-taming  boarding school run by her father, where Alma was the only white pupil. Created in the wake of the Indian Wars, the Stover School was intended to assimilate the children of neighboring reservations. Instead, it robbed them of everything they d known language, customs, even their names and left a heartbreaking legacy in its wake. The bright, courageous boy Alma knew could never have murdered anyone. But she barely recognizes the man Asku has become, cold and embittered at being an outcast in the white world and a ghost in his own. Her lawyer husband, Stewart, reluctantly agrees to help defend Asku for Alma s sake. To do so, Alma must revisit the painful secrets she has kept hidden from everyone especially Stewart. Told in compelling narratives that alternate between Alma s childhood and her present life, Between Earth and Sky is a haunting and complex story of love and loss, as a quest for justice becomes a journey toward understanding and, ultimately, atonement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pfEtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day the Zoo Came to Visit.(Brief Article)(Book Review): An article from: Reviewer's Bookwatch","description":"When Christal Presley's father was eighteen, he was drafted to Vietnam. Like many men of that era who returned home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he was never the same. Christal's father spent much of her childhood locked in his room, gravitating between the deepest depression and unspeakable rage, unable to participate in holidays or birthdays. At a very young age, Christal learned to walk on eggshells, doing anything and everything not to provoke him, but this dance caused her to become a profoundly disturbed little girl. She acted out at school, engaged in self-mutilation, and couldn't make friends. At the age of eighteen, Christal left home and didn't look back. She barely spoke to her father for the next thirteen years. To any outsider, Christal appeared to be doing well: she earned a BA and a master's, got married, and traveled to India. But despite all these accomplishments, Christal still hadn't faced her biggest challenge her relationship with her father. In 2009, something changed. Christal decided it was time to begin the healing process, and she extended an olive branch. She came up with what she called \\"The Thirty Day Project,\\" a month's worth of conversations during which she would finally ask her father difficult questions about Vietnam. Thirty Days with My Father is a gritty yet heartwarming story of those thirty days of a daughter and father reconnecting in a way that will inspire us all to seek the truth, even from life's most difficult relationships. This beautifully realized memoir shares how one woman and her father discovered profound lessons about their own strength and will to survive, shedding an inspiring light on generational PTSD.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8tkfAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orchids in the Moonlight (Vincent Youmans' Popular Favorites in Classical Style for Piano Solo)","description":"Show Tunes fully chronicles the shows, songs, and careers of the major composers of the American musical theatre, from Jerome Kern's earliest interpolations to the latest hits on Broadway. Legendary composers like Gershwin, Rodgers, Porter, Berlin, Bernstein, and Sondheim have been joined by more recent songwriters like Stephen Schwartz, Stephen Flaherty, Michael John LaChiusa, and Adam Guettel. This majestic reference book covers their work, their innovations, their successes, and their failures. Show Tunes is simply the most comprehensive volume of its kind ever produced, and this newly revised and updated edition discusses almost 1,000 shows and 9,000 show tunes. The book has been called \\"a concise skeleton key to the Broadway musical\\" (Variety) and \\"a ground-breaking reference work with a difference\\" (Show Music)-or, as the Washington Post observed, \\"It makes you sing and dance all over your memory.\\" The eagerly anticipated Fourth Edition, updated through May, 2009, features the entire theatrical output of forty of Broadway's leading composers, in addition to a wide selection of work by other songwriters.

The volume starts with a brief introduction, which is followed by studies of Aztec human sacrifice and the literary motif of human sacrifice in medieval Irish literature. Turning to ancient Greece, three cases of human sacrifice are analysed: a ritual example, a mythical case, and one in which myth and ritual are interrelated. The early Christians were the victims of accusations of human sacrifice, but in turn imputed the crime to heterodox Christians, just as the Jews imputed the crime to their neighbours. The ancient Egyptians rarely seem to have practised human sacrifice, but buried the pharaoh's servants with him in order to serve him in the afterlife, albeit only for a brief period at the very beginning of pharaonic civilization. In ancient India we can follow the traditions of human sacrifice from the earliest texts up to modern times, where especially in eastern India goddesses, such as Kali, were long worshipped with human victims. In Japanese tales human sacrifice often takes the form of self-sacrifice, and there may well be a line from these early sacrifices to modern kamikaze. The last study throws a surprising light on human sacrifice in China.

The rational is simple: If the router protecting a network is exposed to hackers, then so is the network behind it. Hardening Cisco Routers is a reference for protecting the protectors. Included are the following topics: The importance of router security and where routers fit into an overall security plan Different router configurations for various versions of Cisco?s IOS Standard ways to access a Cisco router and the security implications of each Password and privilege levels in Cisco routers Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) control Router warning banner use (as recommended by the FBI) Unnecessary protocols and services commonly run on Cisco routers SNMP security Anti-spoofing Protocol security for RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, NTP, and BGP Logging violations Incident response Physical security Written by Thomas Akin, an experienced Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Cisco Academic Instructor (CCAI), the book is well organized, emphasizing practicality and a hands-on approach. At the end of each chapter, Akin includes a Checklist that summarizes the hardening techniques discussed in the chapter. The Checklists help you double-check the configurations you have been instructed to make, and serve as quick references for future security procedures.Concise and to the point, Hardening Cisco Routers supplies you with all the tools necessary to turn a potential vulnerability into a strength.

The most popular of Lewis's twenty-seven books, Naples '44 is a landmark poetic study of the agony of wartime occupation and its ability to bring out the worst, and often the best, in human nature. In prose both heartrending and comic, Lewis describes an era of disillusionment, escapism, and hysteria in which the Allied occupiers mete out justice unfairly and fail to provide basic necessities to the populace while Neapolitan citizens accuse each other of being Nazi spies, women offer their bodies to the same Allied soldiers whose supplies they steal for sale on the black market, and angry young men organize militias to oppose \\"temporary\\" foreign rule. Yet over the chaotic din, Lewis sings intimately of the essential dignity of the Neapolitan people, whose traditions of civility, courage, and generosity of spirit shine through daily. This essential World War II book is as timely a read as ever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BgRQswEACAAJ&dq=Naples+%2744&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crush Step 3, 2e","description":"Written and reviewed by students, residents, and experts, and led by bestselling review author Dr. Ted O'Connell, Crush Step 1, 2nd Edition, is the perfect review resource you need to score high on this high-stakes exam.

Yet it was never a one way exchange. From the first Arab embassy to the Vikings in the 9th century to the internet musings of the Taliban, A Middle East Mosaic collects a rich, boisterous literature of cultural exchange. We see the American Revolution through the eyes of a Moroccan Ambassador and the French Revolution through a series of Imperial Ottoman proclamations. We find surprising portraits of Napoleon (\\"a brigand chief\\"), TE Lawrence and Ataturk. We learn what George Washington and Machiavelli through t of Turkish politics and hear Flaubert and Thackeray rail against eastern crime and punishment. We peer into Voltaire's business correspondence and follow the footsteps of Mark Twain, Richard Burton, Gertrude Bell and Ibn Battutta, the Marco Polo of the east. Great discoveries are recorded - an Egyptian Ambassador is introduced to electricity and dismisses the spectacle as \\"frankish trickery;\\" another pronounces the invention of a secure mail system most useful for assignations. We enter the harem with a 16th century organ maker and emerge with Ottoman reform. It was not until the sixteenth century that the first middle eastern rulers entered into diplomatic relations with European rulers, but trade often precede diplomatic relations. Business men from the days of the crusades against Saladin to the oil prospecting of Samuel Cox and his descendents have seen great possibilities in the markets of the middle east. And throughout the centuries we have been united by war. We witness the outbreak of the Crimean war with Karl Marx and enter Egypt with Napoleon. We observe Arab customs with George Patton and visit Baghdad and Cairo with George F. Kennan in the second world war. When Usama bin Ladin rails against \\"Jews and crusaders\\" occupying the holy land, he is rehearsing a grievance with a long history. This symphony of voices, full of wit and wisdom, spite and wonder, suspicion, befuddlement and occasional insight, is ordered and explained by our foremost living historian of the middle east. The fruit of a lifetime of scholarship and erudition, A Middle East Mosaic is a dazzling capstone to a brilliant career. In a spirited reappraisal of western views of the east and eastern views of the west over the last two thousand years, Bernard Lewis gives us a brilliant over-view of 2,000 years of commerce, diplomacy, war and exploration. This book is a delight, a treasury of stories drawn from letters, diaries and histories, but also from unpublished archives and previously untranslated accounts. Diplomats and interpreters, slaves, soldiers, pilgrims and missionaries, princes and spies, businessmen, doctors and priests all pour forth their stories of the people and events that shaped history. A Middle East Mosaic cannot fail to appeal to anyone with an appetite for history and a curiosity about the vagaries of cultural exchange.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VudI81drMBoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherston's progress","description":"The third volume in Siegfried Sassoon s beloved trilogy, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston, with a new introduction by celebrated historian Paul Fussell A highly decorated English soldier and an acclaimed poet and novelist, Siegfried Sassoon won fame for his trilogy of fictionalized autobiographies that wonderfully capture the vanishing idylls of Edwardian England and the brutal realities of war. Having been deemed mentally ill for his anti-war sentiments and sent for treatment, George Sherston comes under the care of neurologist Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, who allows Sherston to sort through his attitudes toward the fighting (events that have also been semi-fictionalized by Pat Barker for her bestselling and critically acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy). After six months in the hospital, Sherston leaves to rejoin his regiment. He is soon dispatched to Ireland, where he attempts to reclaim some of the idyllic fox-hunting days of his youth, then to Palestine. He finally ends up at the Western Front in France, where he is shot in the head while on a reconnaissance mission and invalided back home. As the capstone of Sassoon's masterful Sherston trilogy, Sherston's Progress whose evocation of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is not at all accidental literally brings home the unforgettable journey of George Sherston from aristocratic childhood through war hero and anti-war martyr, all the way to wounded veteran trying to move on from the Great War.

She walks a tightrope between the Navajo and white worlds, fully accepted by neither but needed by both. Ella's brother, Clifford, a hataali or medicine man, says that her investigative skills are a gift from the spirits who guard and guide the Dineh, but Ella insists it's her FBI training that has honed her instincts. Ella's life is about to change in ways she can barely begin to imagine--she is newly pregnant, and though she knows who the father is, she will not marry him. In Navajo society, her child will be of her clan, and will be accepted by her family, no matter what--but how can she stay a police officer, exposing herself and her unborn child to terrible danger day after day? Given her current caseload, it's hard for Ella to put off making a final decision about her career. There's a near-riot at LabKote, a factory on the Reservation that produces high-quality vessels for medical labs. The Fierce Ones, an activist group of Navajo, are insisting that more native workers be hired by the firm--including a Navajo replacement for a manager recently found dead in his car, an apparent suicide. A sniper shoots at Ella as she drives to another crime scene--the home of State Senator James Yellowhair, who has been kidnapped. Feuding between traditionalist and modernist elements in the Navajo nation heats up with sabotage, vandalism, and murder, spurred by a rise in birth defects among the Dineh's livestock and rustling of sheep and cattle. Ella's personal concerns mount when officers investigating a break-in at the health clinic discover that the records of several pregnant women--including Ella--are missing. Then one of the pregnant women is murdered....

Here, placing it in the context of his era, David Felix examines the evolution of Keynes's theorizing. He boldly claims that The General Theory lacks logical and factual support as pure theory, but is an achievement of great statesmanship in political economy. Felix argues that Keynes's ideas have misled successive generations of students and practitioners. He suggests that a more discriminating view of his thought can reconcile Keynesian views with neoclassical theory and replace the false synthesis that dominates contemporary text-books with a truer one. Biography of an Idea devotes four chapters to an analysis of The General Theory and an examination of the economic logic of Keynes. The author disentangles the work's fundamentally simple theses from its difficult technical pre-sentation. He shows how Keynes shaped his economic model as he did as an effort to win public support for sensible policies that clashed with generally accepted beliefs of the time. Biography of an Idea is bound to be controversial due to the many cohorts of economists who have been trained in macroeconomics according to Keynes. It will be of interest and ac-cessible to intellectually curious laymen and students, and important to economists, historians, and political scientists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oro6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Biography+of+an+Idea:+John+Maynard+Keynes+and+the+General+Theory+of+Employment,+Interest+and+Money&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What is PeopleSoft?","description":"An exhaustive book and ebook resource for PeopleSoft Financials application practitioners to understand core concepts, configurations, and business processes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0L3zq4D-PHIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brood of eagles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0fbBAAAACAAJ&dq=Brood+of+eagles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batman: Featuring Two-Face and the Riddler","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beginning and Intermediate Algebra (The Language And Symbolism Of Mathematics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9YCnAQAACAAJ&dq=Beginning+and+Intermediate+Algebra+(The+Language+And+Symbolism+Of+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Know the Freshwater Fishes","description":"An illustrated guide to freshwater fish.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aOIPAQAAMAAJ&dq=How+To+Know+the+Freshwater+Fishes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brain: A Neuroscience Primer","description":"Developed for those with no prior exposure to the field, this primer is an authoritative yet accessible introduction to the brain and its functions.

Idolatry is conceived as the antithesis to the worship of the invisible, unnamed, and articulate God. The proscription against using images in worship sets Judaism, together with Islam, apart from all other religious systems. In Beyond the Graven Image, Lionel Kochan sets out to explain the reasons for this prohibition and to demonstrate how influential this image-ban has been in determining key aspects of Jewish thinking. The Jewish conceptions of holiness and symbolism, our relationship with God, and the role of memory in religion, he argues, as well as the preference for non- material arts such as music over visual modes of artistic expression within Judaism, have all been profoundly shaped by the prohibition against physical representations of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oOw8DAAAQBAJ&dq=Beyond+The+Graven+Image:+A+Jewish+View&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Running The Amazon","description":"The voyage began in the lunar terrain of the Peruvian Andes, where coca leaf is the only remedy against altitude sickness.

Punishment and Social Structure originated from an article written by Georg Rusche in 1933 entitled \\"Labor Market and Penal Sanction: Thoughts on the Sociology of Criminal Justice.\\" Originally published in Germany by the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research, this article became the germ of a theory of criminology that laid the groundwork for all subsequent research in this area. Rusche and Kirchheimer look at crime from an historical perspective, and correlate methods of punishment with both temporal cultural values and economic conditions. The authors classify the history of crime into three primary eras: the early Middle Ages, in which penance and fines were the predominant modes of punishment; the later Middle Ages, in which harsh corporal punishment and capital punishment moved to the forefront; and the seventeenth century, in which the prison system was more fully developed. They also discuss more recent forms of penal practice, most notably under the constraints of a fascist state. The majority of the book was translated from German into English, and then reshaped by Rusche's co-author, Otto Kirchheimer, with whom Rusche actually had little discussion. While the main body of Punishment and Social Structure are Rusche's ideas, Kirchheimer was responsible for bringing the book more up-to-date to include the Nazi and fascist era. Punishment and Social Structure is a pioneering work that sets a paradigm for the study of crime and punishment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wmxBnwEACAAJ&dq=Punishment+and+social+structure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching English Spelling: A Practical Guide (Cambridge Handbooks for Language Teachers)","description":"A wealth of activities for practising spelling for second language, foreign language teaching and first language contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bjbUzJeoe-AC&dq=Teaching+English+Spelling:+A+Practical+Guide+(Cambridge+Handbooks+for+Language+Teachers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Cruise Ships and Ocean Liners from 1954 to 1986: A Photographic Survey (Dover Maritime)","description":"This pictorial record describes the last great years of transatlantic travel up to the rise of cruise ships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RCRUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+Cruise+Ships+and+Ocean+Liners+from+1954+to+1986:+A+Photographic+Survey+(Dover+Maritime)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War","description":"The Red Badge of Courage is a war novel by American author Stephen Crane (1871-1900). Taking place during the American Civil War, the story is about a young private of the Union Army, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a \\"red badge of courage,\\" to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as standard-bearer.Although Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its realism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1893, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by Century Magazine) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1982.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IbH_rQEACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Badge+of+Courage:+An+Episode+of+the+American+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Missouri, the cave state (Dark pathways series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng8FGQAACAAJ&dq=Missouri,+the+cave+state+(Dark+pathways+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marching through Georgia: My Walk along Sherman's Route","description":"In 1864 William Tecumseh Sherman made Civil War history with his infamous March to the Sea across Georgia.

After three years of legal wrangling, the state's highest court was about to speak to the question of whether sponsors of a traditionally-themed and privately organised St. Patrick's Day Parade could ban, without violating the state's public accommodation law, a gay activist group from marching behind a banner proclaiming its homosexual orientation. When the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the decision of the trial court that the Allied War Veterans Council's traditional parade, replete with Irish flags, shamrocks, bag-pipe bands, pro-life, POW, political, religious and cultural message, was not expressive enough to be protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and because of this, could not exclude a group with an antithetical, non-traditional message from participating, the stage was set for a historic constitutional confrontation.In this important book on how the dismantling of the First Amendment occurred, the authors chronicle the social and legal arguments from trial court all the way to the United States Supreme Court, offering the reader a rare glimpse into how a legal controversy makes its way to the nation's highest court against a network of biased court judges, politically correct law firms, a state anti-discrimination agency, academe, and a timid municipal administration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nbs6AQAAIAAJ&dq=From+Trial+Court+to+the+United+States+Supreme+Court:+Anatomy+of+a+Free+Speech+Case:+The+Incredible+Inside+Story+Behind+the+Theft+of+the+St.+Patrick%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hotel Del Coronado","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZqYEP2C21GYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay C Harmonica Blues Play-Along Trax Booklet/2-CD Set","description":"\\"Get a back-up band in a box!

This biography uncovers the real Berry and provides us with a stirring, unvarnished portrait of both the man and the artist. Berry has long been one of pop music's most enigmatic personalities. Growing up in a middle-class, black neighborhood in St. Louis, his first major hit song, \\"Maybellene,\\" was an adaptation of a white country song, wedded to a black-influenced beat. Thereafter came a string of brilliant songs celebrating teenage life in the '50s, including \\"School Day,\\" \\"Johnny B. Goode,\\" and \\"Sweet Little Sixteen.\\" Berry's career rise was meteoric; but his fall came equally quickly, when his relations with an underage girl led to his conviction. It was not his first (nor his last) run in with the law. He scored his biggest hit in the early '70s with the comical (and some would say decidedly lightweight) song \\"My Ding-a-Ling.\\" The following decades brought hundreds of nights of tours, with little attention from the recording industry. Bruce Pegg offers the definitive, though not always pretty, portrait of one of the greatest stars of rock and roll, a story that will appeal to all fans of American popular music.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9UuMAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The McWilliams II Word Processor Instruction Manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M4fJmgEACAAJ&dq=The+McWilliams+II+Word+Processor+Instruction+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holiness to the Lord: A Guide to the Exposition of the Book of Leviticus","description":"At first glance, the Book of Leviticus seems like barren material for lively preaching. Most expositors merely skim the surface for messages on tithing or sabbath-keeping. Yet Leviticus is one of the most important books of the Old Testament; it not only describes the complete religious system of ancient Israel, it also lays the theological foundation for the Christian gospel. In Holiness to the Lord, Allen P. Ross enables preachers and teachers to mine the riches of Leviticus and deliver them to a contemporary audience. Following the same practical method he used in the acclaimed Creation and Blessing, Ross first carefully sites Leviticus within its context in the ancient world. Then he traces the development of God's plan of salvation-how Leviticus' laws, rituals, symbols, and events prepared for the complete revelation in Jesus Christ. Finally, unlike traditional commentaries, Ross offers helpful ideas for correlating Leviticus to New Testament teachings (particularly Romans, Hebrews, and Peter) and for applying the material in relevant expository form.

Shomon, here is a holistic roadmap for diagnosis, treatment and recovery for the millions of people suffering from Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism. There are an estimated 3 million-plus Americans suffering from Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism, and patient advocate Mary J. Shomon will guide them through the diagnosis and the wide-ranging treatments available. Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism are the result of the thyroid gland being overactive. This gland controls the body's metabolism, so people afflicted with the disorder can suffer from symptoms such as significant weight loss, fatigue, muscular weakness, and rapid heartbeat, among others. In addition to conventional treatments, this resource uniquely highlights holistic treatments, and through case studies and testimonials from patients and doctors, presents an honest look at the lifestyles and choices of people living with these conditions. Shomon presents the reader with a comprehensive resource that spans from diagnosis to treatment to life after treatment. She goes beyond the conventional advice of other books, utilizing patient anecdotes and, as a fellow thyroid disease patient, her own experience. Her extensive network of experts from conventional physicians to alternative practitioners allows for a wide range of treatment options. In addition, a comprehensive Appendix serves as a fantastic resource for patients seeking treatment and additional advice. The first edition of Living Well With Hypothyroidism (2/2000) started with a first printing of 7,500 copies and has now sold over 100,000 in the US. Shomon's The Thyroid Diet hit the New York Times extended bestseller list. Mary Shomon has been praised by doctors around the country for her medical knowledge and sensitivity to patients' needs. Barbara Bush brought attention to the plight of Graves' disease patients, announcing that she was suffering from it when she was First Lady.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8I-SVcBjKigC&dq=Living+Well+with+Graves%27+Disease+and+Hyperthyroidism:+What+Your+Doctor+Doesn%27t+Tell+You...That+You+Need+to+Know+(Living+Well+(Collins))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Judas Kiss (#480)","description":"Liam Neeson starred on Broadway in this compelling depiction of Oscar Wilde just before and after his imprisonment.

In London, then in Cornwall, then back in London, the simmering tension between Rosemary s parents erupted into outright warfare fueled by alcohol and her father s persistent, unrepentant womanizing.

But what she did not expect was what she would lose: aspects of her identity, a baseline level of happiness, a general sense of wellbeing. And though she had the benefit of a supportive husband during this transition, she also at times resented the fact that the disruption to his life seemed to pale in comparison to hers. As a clinical psychologist, Molly knew her experience was a normal response to a life-changing event. But without the advantage of such a perspective, many of the patients she treated in her private practice grappled with self-doubt, guilt, and fear, and suffered the dual pain of not only the struggle to adjust but also the overwhelming shame for struggling at all. In To Have and to Hold, Molly explores the complex terrain of new motherhood, illuminating the ways it affects women psychologically, emotionally, physically, and professionally as well as how it impacts their partnership. Along with the arrival of a bundle of joy come thorny issues such as self-worth, control, autonomy, and dependency. And for most new mothers, these issues are experienced within the context of an intimate relationship, adding another layer of tension, conflict, and confusion to an already challenging time. As Molly examines the inextricable link between women s well-being as new mothers and the well-being of their relationships, she offers guidance to help readers reclaim their identities, overcome their guilt and shame, and repair their relationships. A blend of personal narrative, scientific research, and stories from Molly s clinical practice, To Have and to Hold provides a much-needed lifeline to new mothers everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hy9kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistics for Management (7th Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=loa4KcmMmbcC&dq=Statistics+for+Management+(7th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Frog : My First Look at the Life Cycle of an Amphibian (My First Look at Nature)","description":"Cumulative verses introduce information on the six stages in the life cycle of the leopard frog over the course of the seasons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9uUbPAAACAAJ&dq=A+New+Frog+:+My+First+Look+at+the+Life+Cycle+of+an+Amphibian+(My+First+Look+at+Nature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Planning for practice success: Business plan preparation and practical advice for the new chiropractic business","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sKgptwAACAAJ&dq=Planning+for+practice+success:+Business+plan+preparation+and+practical+advice+for+the+new+chiropractic+business&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pictures of Home: A Memoir of Family and City","description":"Faith and the Historian collects essays from eight experienced historians discussing the impact of being \\"touched\\" by Catholicism on their vision of history.

In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of nongaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible.

This is entirely appropriate, for while Saturnin draws on a tradition of Czech comedy and authors such as J. Ha?ek, K. ?apek and K. Pol ?ek, it was also clearly influenced by the English masters Jerome K. Jerome and P. G. Wodehouse. Saturnin is the story of a young man in love and his faithful servant Saturnin, who upsets the peaceful rhythm of his master s domestic arrangements and turns his life inside out. He lures him into an exotic world where he is forced to live dangerously, and shows him how to cope with any situation. Saturnin lays bare the weaknesses of others and compels them to disclose their  true  nature  he is a subversive servant. Written at a time when Czechoslovakia was deep in the grip of the Nazi occupation, Saturnin showed that one form of resistance was to put the world created by invasion out of your mind and create another. However, so recognisably Czech was that  other  that its popularity did not diminish with the end of the war or, indeed, with the end of the forty years of communism that followed shortly after the war s end. The book has been adapted for radio and television, produced as a film and has a regular place in the repertoire of the Czech stage.  A delicious dry humour and an imaginative flair that makes it much more than just the  Czech Jeeves.  Owing more to Jerome K. Jerome than to P. G. Wodehouse, the writing is rich in homespun wisdom and casual asides that take on a life of their own, leading the reader up charming byways of irrelevance  A surprising number of belly-laughs for a novel that is more than half a century old.

Its goal is to provide a comprehensive survey of the current state of the field, the many connections among its varioussub-disciplines, and the likely directions of its future development. The Oxford Handbook of Applied Linguistics addresses a broad audience: applied linguists; educators and other scholars working in language acquisition, language learning, language planning, teaching, and testing; and linguistsconcerned with applications of their work. Early applied linguistics was predominantly associated with language-teaching. While this relationship continues, the field has long since diversified, becoming increasingly inter-related and multi-disciplinary. The volume addresses the diversity of questions facing applied linguists today: What isthe place of applied linguistics in the architecture of the university? Where does applied linguistics fit into the sociology of knowledge? What are the questions that applied linguistics ought to be addressing? What are the dominant paradigms guiding research in the field? What kinds of problemscan be solved through the mediation of applied linguistics? What aspects of linguistics can be empirically applied to language-based problems, and what spaces resist such application? What will new students of applied linguistics need to know in the coming years? Systematically encompassing the major areas of applied linguistics-and drawing from a wide range of disciplines such as education, language policy, bi- and multi-lingualism, literacy, language and gender, psycholinguistics/cognition, language and computers, discourse analysis, language andconcordinances, ecology of language, pragmatics, translation, psycholinguistics and cognition, and many other fields-the editors and contributors to The Oxford Handbook of Applied Linguistics provide a panoramic and comprehensive look at this complex and vigorous field. This second edition includes three new chapters, and the remaining chapters have been thoroughly revised and updated to give a clear picture of the current state of applied linguistics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3Wa0Ac_gddwC&dq=The+Oxford+Handbook+of+Applied+Linguistics+(Oxford+Handbooks+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swimming with Scapulars: True Confessions of a Young Catholic","description":"Meet Matthew Lickona, a thirty-something wine columnist, sometime cartoonist, avid moviegoer, fan of alternative rock, and wonderfully talented writer. He is also a devoutly religious young man (\\"I am a Roman Catholic, baptized as an infant and raised in the faith, a faith which holds the exemplary and redemptive suffering of Jesus Christ at its core.\\" ) who fasts during Lent, leads his family in prayer every day, and wears a scapular--a medieval amulet said to protect the wearer from harm. In Lickona's \\"true confessions,\\" we are introduced to a unique and singular voice, but one that is emblematic of a new generation of believers who combine a premodern faith with a postmodern sensibility. \\"Swimming with Scapulars \\"is a modern-day, Catholic, coming-of-age story that takes its author from the austere Catholicism of his Irish-French family in upstate New York to the exotic spiritual tapestry of Southern California. It is the story of the formation of an ardent young believer who is painfully honest about his spiritual shortcomings (\\"In times of suffering, I look first to myself. God is the backup, to be called upon when I find myself insufficient.\\"), yet who finds consuming joy in receiving the Eucharist and embracing \\"the ancient treasures of the faith.\\" Lickona doesn't mind that many of his secular friends and acquaintances regard him as a religious fanatic. As he writes, \\"Perhaps, coming from a fanatic, the message of God's love will regain some of its wonderful outrageousness. 'Listen. I have a secret. I eat God, and I have his life in me. It's the best thing in the world.'\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Muo4MbmuAMkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Catcher of the Wise: Poetic Interpretations from the Hebrew Scriptures aka the Old Testament","description":"The author has chosen a poetic form to retell some of the familiar stories of the Old Testament a.k.a. the Hebrew Scriptures.

Getting enough sleep is vital for the health of a growing baby or toddler, and the sanity of mums and dads. Yet striking the right balance between their differing needs can be hard to achieve. Once sleep problems set in, they can fast demoralise and exhaust parents, undermining confidence in their ability to cope.

This book informs and reassures parents, dispelling many common myths and anxieties and offering practical solutions that work. By creating a structure of regular feeding, sleeping and playing times, Gina explains how parents can help their baby to find a rhythm that will be comfortable for all concerned.

It speaks of a childhood during the Hitler regime, about all the horrific experiences of a family that refused to go along with the system.

A true story of intrigue, paranoia, murder and money set in the shimmering cities of South Florida in the 1990s.

It would be impossible to invent a man like Rick Parker, a freakishly fat ginger-haired giant who modelled his personal style on Elvis Presley and wanted to become the next Don King. Then Rick met Tim Anderson, a handsome, funny former baseball pro - was he the fighter to take Parker all the way? Rick left a trail of fixed fights and violent mayhem all across the South, but his dream stayed out of reach. By the end of his reign of terror the heroic Tim would be broke, poisoned and facing the hardest choice of his life. \\"The Years of The Locust\\" turns a remarkable, riotous true-crime story into a profound examination of fate, choices and remorse - one that's scary, sad and blackly, bleakly funny.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MzKzpX4vxIC&dq=The+years+of+the+locust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Falcon;","description":"This book tells the true story of a frontier boy, John Tanner, who became the courageous leader of the Chippewa Indians and played an important part in the struggle for control of the fur trade in Northwest.

Then, two years later, Netnokwa, retiring chieftess of the tribe, adopted him and took him with her to live with the Chippewas. Life became socially easier and John s natural abilities made him a leader. Rivalries ensued, both personal ones and those of the fur trading companies, but ultimately John makes his name in helping Selkirk with the Red River settlement.

She meets Alex. The similarities between the two women's life experiences and tastes are glaringly obvious, at least to the casual observer. But Emilie hasn't figured out, yet, that she is attracted to Alex's conversations and charismatic personality. They have so much in common that Alex could, at times, pass for Emilie's alter ego. However, Emilie also meets Tamara, one of Alex's ex-lovers. Tamara is intelligent and sensual but, at twenty-eight, she might be here one day and gone the next. Despite this, Emilie is attracted to the young woman's physicality and to her youthful wisdom. Risking-me is about triggers As the candles flickered on the nightstands, as their glow danced sensuously across her face, her collarbone, over the immature creases of her stomach, over the length of her thighs, and the dark patch of springy hair, I knew that if I could draw I would've drawn her. Not on the spot, no, but later. I would've drawn her during a re-enactment of sorts. She would have let me draw her if I had told her of the dance of light across the valleys and planes of her strong and healthy body. If I had known how to, I would have told her about illusions, as well. About illusions of light and illusions of my own making as I delighted in the aestheticism of her naked body. I would have drawn her as she was. At ease inside her body. Her body at ease with itself and with her. Just as she was, watching me. (Emilie) Risking-me, unlike the 'average' lesbian romance, looks at the everyday realities of women. C.C. Saint-Clair explores issues such as domestic violence, ageing and age difference between lovers, as well as the universal fears of rejection and impermanence. Within the context of these everyday realities, there are also fun times and moments of exquisite connection between women. Will Emilie's self-reflexive musings lead to insights which might gradually allow her to 'let go' and to risk becoming involved with Tamara, who is many years younger? Layer upon delicate layer of erotic sensation and desire between Emilie and Tamara is portrayed subtly and passionately through Saint-Clair's sensuous language and imagery. This subtle, sensuous, slow spiraling of stimulation and sensation reminds me of the French confection 'mille-feuilles' (literally, a thousand leaves)  multi-layered, simultaneously rich and light, creamily textured and delicious.

G. Jung Letters in Two Volumes 1906-1961","description":"In May 1956, in his eighty-second year, Jung first discussed with Gerhard Adler the question of the publication of his letters. Over many years, Jung had often used the medium of letters to communicate his ideas to others and to clarify the interpretation of his work, quite apart from answering people who approached him with genuine problems of their own and simply corresponding with friends and colleagues. Many of his letters thus contain new creative ideas and provide a running commentary on his work. From some 1,600 letters written by Jung between the years 1906-1961, the editors have selected over 1,000. Volume 2 contains 460 letters written between 1951 and 1961, during the last years of Jung's life, when he was in contact with many people whose names are familiar to the English reader. These include Mircea Eliade, R.F.C. Hull, Ernest Jones, Herbert Read, J.B. Rhine, Upton Sinclair and Fr. Victor White. Volume 2 also contains an addenda with sixteen letters from the period 1915-1946 and a subject index to both volumes.

Distracted and polluted by worldliness, the lower self has a tendency to drag the human creature down into arrogance and vice. Only by a powerful effort of will can the sincere worshipper achieve the purity of soul which enables him to attain God's proximity. This translation of two chapters from The Revival of the Religious Sciences (Ihya' 'Ulum al-Din) details the sophisticated spiritual techniques adopted by classical Islam. In the first step, On Disciplining the Soul, which cites copious anecdotes from the Islamic scriptures and biographies of the saints, Ghazali explains how to acquire good character traits, and goes on to describe how the sickness of the heart may be cured. In the second part, Breaking the Two Desires, he focusses on the question of gluttony and sexual desire, concluding, in the words of the Prophet, that 'the best of all matters is the middle way'. The translator has added an introduction and notes which explore Ghazali's ability to make use of Greek as well as Islamic ethics. The work will prove of special interest to those interested in Sufi mysticism, comparative ethics, and the question of sexuality in Islam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6AYwvgAACAAJ&dq=Al-Ghazali+on+Disciplining+the+Soul+and+on+Breaking+the+Two+Desires:+Books+XXII+and+XXIII+of+the+Revival+of+the+Religious+Sciences+(Ghazali+Series)+(Bk.+22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through the eyes of the masters;: Meditations and portraits,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kZK3XwAACAAJ&dq=Through+the+eyes+of+the+masters%3B:+Meditations+and+portraits,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uniform Building Code 1997 Volume 1","description":"The Uniform Building Code is one of the most widely adopted model building codes in the world and is a proven document meeting the needs of government units charged with enforcement of building regulation.

Success is now as much a matter of navigating the maze of changing testing structures, crippling self-conceptions, and family dynamics as it is about memorizing vocabulary words. Tutors Ned Johnson and Emily Warner Eskelsen tackle the trials of the SAT head-on, revealing that the way our culture values this test is just as important as the answers teens fill in. Johnson and Eskelsen cover a wide range of topics including: * Anxiety and ways to avoid \\"choking\\" on the test * Best ways to prepare before the test  from exercise to nutrition to sleep * Family communication * What the SAT is actually testing * How test-taking strategies will help teens in all walks of life * Learning differences in teens and strategies for success","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EcyjtGXDIF4C&dq=Conquering+the+SAT:+How+Parents+Can+Help+Teens+Overcome+the+Pressure+and+Succeed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Embassy Door: Canada, Clinton, and Quebec","description":"From the moment he became U.S. ambassador to Canada in 1993, James J. Blanchard was determined to make a difference. He succeeded - to hte benefit of both countries. \\"Behind the Embassy Door is an insider's view of politics and diplomacy at one of the most crucial periods in the history of U.S.-Canada relations. The North American Free Trade Agreement, negotiated against a background of fierce controversy, was agreed to but not yet ratified and a newly elected Liberal government had promised to renegotiate the deal. At the same time, the separatist government in Quebec was pushing the country to the brink of dissolution with a referendum on sovereignty. This book gives fascinating insight into the role of the U.S. ambassador at a time when seemingly minor remarks and gestures could prove decisive. This is an extraordinary account of how international relations are conducted at the highest level. It is also a candid account of the everyday life of an ambassador abroad. Blanchard takes us behind the scenes with a number of Canadian and American politicians and public figures, from Prime Minister Jean Chretien to President Clinton, and many of their senior cabinet members and advisers. Blanchard describes the coast-to-coast trip across Canada that he undertook shortly after his arrival. And he tells about visits to Ottawa by the president, Vice-President Gore, Madeleine Albright, and many others. He recalls how the president's mother charmed a thousand women and how Hillary Clinton skated on the famed Rideau Canal. This book offers an unprecedented and frequently surprising look at the intimate everyday workings of a relationship that is unique among nations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TbwMAQAAMAAJ&dq=Behind+the+Embassy+Door:+Canada,+Clinton,+and+Quebec&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emergency Medicine On Call","description":"This logically organized, quick-access reference focuses on the initial evaluation and treatment of problems most frequently encountered in the emergency room.This portable book features differential diagnosis, key laboratory and diagnostic tests, as well as treatment plans for 120 of the most common problems facing the emergency department.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b3IyKfmAxJEC&dq=Emergency+Medicine+On+Call&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich: The 21st-Century Edition: Revised and Updated","description":"Think and Grow Rich has been called the \\"Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature.\\" It was the first book to boldly ask, \\"What makes a winner?\\" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself. The most famous of all teachers of success spent \\"a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort\\" to produce the \\"Law of Success\\" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one. In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth.

Recentearthquakes, such as the ones in Kobe, Japan, and Oakland,California, have led to a heightened awareness of seismic risk andhave revolutionized bridge design and retrofit philosophies. In Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges, three of the world's topauthorities on the subject have collaborated to produce the mostexhaustive reference on seismic bridge design currently available.Following a detailed examination of the seismic effects of actualearthquakes on local area bridges, the authors demonstrate designstrategies that will make these and similar structures optimallyresistant to the damaging effects of future seismicdisturbances. Relying heavily on worldwide research associated with recentquakes, Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges begins with anin-depth treatment of seismic design philosophy as it applies tobridges. The authors then describe the various geotechnicalconsiderations specific to bridge design, such as soil-structureinteraction and traveling wave effects. Subsequent chapters coverconceptual and actual design of various bridge superstructures, andmodeling and analysis of these structures. As the basis for their design strategies, the authors' focus is onthe widely accepted capacity design approach, in which particularlyvulnerable locations of potentially inelastic flexural deformationare identified and strengthened to accommodate a greater degree ofstress. The text illustrates how accurate application of thecapacity design philosophy to the design of new bridges results instructures that can be expected to survive most earthquakes withonly minor, repairable damage. Because the majority of today's bridges were built before thecapacity design approach was understood, the authors also devoteseveral chapters to the seismic assessment of existing bridges,with the aim of designing and implementing retrofit measures toprotect them against the damaging effects of future earthquakes.These retrofitting techniques, though not considered appropriate inthe design of new bridges, are given considerable emphasis, sincethey currently offer the best solution for the preservation ofthese vital and often historically valued thoroughfares. Practical and applications-oriented, Seismic Design and Retrofit ofBridges is enhanced with over 300 photos and line drawings toillustrate key concepts and detailed design procedures. As the onlytext currently available on the vital topic of seismic bridgedesign, it provides an indispensable reference for civil,structural, and geotechnical engineers, as well as students inrelated engineering courses. A state-of-the-art text on earthquake-proof design and retrofit ofbridges Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges fills the urgent need for acomprehensive and up-to-date text on seismic-ally resistant bridgedesign. The authors, all recognized leaders in the field,systematically cover all aspects of bridge design related toseismic resistance for both new and existing bridges. * A complete overview of current design philosophy for bridges,with related seismic and geotechnical considerations * Coverage of conceptual design constraints and their relationshipto current design alternatives * Modeling and analysis of bridge structures * An exhaustive look at common building materials and theirresponse to seismic activity * A hands-on approach to the capacity design process * Use of isolation and dissipation devices in bridge design * Important coverage of seismic assessment and retrofit design ofexisting bridges","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IeS1ns7xuSUC&dq=Seismic+Design+and+Retrofit+of+Bridges&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarzan And The Forbidden City","description":"Tarzan and the Forbidden City - Edgar Rice Burroughs - A young man named Brian Gregory has disappeared in Africa, looking for the fabled Father of Diamonds; his father and sister want to go rescue him, and they can only enlist Tarzan's help because they know Captain Paul D\`Arnot.

Certainly no one in the Polish-German community of his youth could have foreseen his influence on the direction of American popular music or his enduring fame on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry. Even Pee Wee King himself is incredulous at the unlikely twists and turns of his life and career. Pee Wee King is best remembered today as the co-writer of the most popular country music song of all time, The Tennessee Waltz. He is just as important, however, for his vital role in expanding the horizons, and the market potential, of country and western music. He took the polka and waltz rhythms of his youth, mixed them with the sounds of the big bands of the thirties and forties, and flavored it all with the balladry and moods of the Western cowboy. He combined this new sound with folk and country traditions rooted in places like Louisville, Knoxville, and Nashville. The result was a smooth, listenable, danceable, up-to-date sound that has become the most popular form of music in the United States. Recipient of numerous awards, including induction into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame, Pee Wee King has been one of the most important figures in country music for over sixty years. Told in King's own voice and words, this biography, based on many hours of taped conversations, is the first account of King's incredible life and career. Featuring a star-studded cast of characters from the history of music Eddy Arnold, Minnie Pearl, Roy Acuff, Hank Williams, Gene Autry, Patti Page, and many others this memorable book is a must-read for any fan of country music.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0eQzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shamanspace","description":"A multidimensional conspiracy adventure of competing psychic groups battling to take revenge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dDoCAAAACAAJ&dq=Shamanspace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fugitives and Refugees: A Walk in Portland, Oregon (Crown Journeys)","description":"Want to know where Chuck Palahniuk s tonsils currently reside?

In 1956, toward the end of Reverend John Ames's life, he begins a letter to his young son, an account of himself and his forebears. Ames is the son of an Iowan preacher and the grandson of a minister who, as a young man in Maine, saw a vision of Christ bound in chains and came west to Kansas to fight for abolition: He \\"preached men into the Civil War,\\" then, at age fifty, became a chaplain in the Union Army, losing his right eye in battle. Reverend Ames writes to his son about the tension between his father--an ardent pacifist--and his grandfather, whose pistol and bloody shirts, concealed in an army blanket, may be relics from the fight between the abolitionists and those settlers who wanted to vote Kansas into the union as a slave state. And he tells a story of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, which are tested in his tender and strained relationship with his namesake, John Ames Boughton, his best friend's wayward son. This is also the tale of another remarkable vision--not a corporeal vision of God but the vision of life as a wondrously strange creation. It tells how wisdom was forged in Ames's soul during his solitary life, and how history lives through generations, pervasively present even when betrayed and forgotten.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wAVPzQEACAAJ&dq=Gilead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nietzsche's Horse","description":"The horse was essential to the workings of Victorian society, and its representations, which are vast, ranging, and often contradictory, comprise a vibrant cult of the horse. Examining the representational, emblematic, and rhetorical uses of horses in a diversity of nineteenth-century texts, Gina M. Dorr  shows how discourses about horses reveal and negotiate anxieties related to industrialism and technology, constructions of gender and sexuality, ruptures in the social fabric caused by class conflict and mobility, and changes occasioned by national \\"progress\\" and imperial expansion. She argues that as a cultural object, the horse functions as a repository of desire and despair in a society rocked by astonishing social, economic, and technological shifts. While representations of horses abound in Victorian fiction, Gina M. Dorr 's study focuses on those novels by Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Braddon, Anna Sewell, and George Moore that engage with the most impassioned controversies concerning horses and horse-care, such as the introduction of the steam engine, popular new methods of horse-taming, debates over the tight-reining of horses, and the moral furor surrounding gambling at the race track. Her book establishes the centrality of the horse as a Victorian cultural icon and explores how through it, dominant ideologies of gender and class are created, promoted, and disrupted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r5WoDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North American Pinot Noir","description":"This comprehensive reference guide to Pinot Noir wine in North America includes historical and viticultural background and profiles of six dozen prominent producers in California, Oregon, British Columbia, New York, and elsewhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A-UlDQAAQBAJ&dq=North+American+Pinot+Noir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buenos Aires: A Cultural History (Cultural Histories Series)","description":"Whether for tango, football, or art, passions in Buenos Aires run high.

Successfully weaves histories, data, and stories together in examining land redistribution. There is a judicious and enlightening use of secondary and primary sources, which makes this a virtually unique study.\\"--James L. Dietz, University of California, Fullerton \\"Offers a refreshing and much-needed fine-grained ethnographic and historic examination of the years of the Partido Popular reforms.\\"--Vilma Santiago-Irizarry, Cornell University The 1930s and the reign of the New Dealers in Washington brought incredible changes to Puerto Rican society. A new land redistribution plan, formalized in the 1941 Land Law, aimed at enfranchising, empowering, and urbanizing the landless workers by resettling them in parcels that they would own. With these new urban communities built, community cooperation and services such as potable water, electricity, education, and sanitation followed. The result was that twenty years after the passage of the Land Law Puerto Rico was cited internationally as a paragon of modern development. In this intimate and enlightening work, Ismael Garc a-Col n uses ethnography, political and economic theory, and primary and secondary historical sources to paint a compelling and human portrait of the land redistribution program. He assesses not only the technical and political aspects of the program but also the ways in which the Puerto Rican people actively resisted, accommodated, and influenced the development it brought about.

A canal dug from Sturgeon Bay to Lake Michigan in 1880 enabled ships to avoid the long passage over the tip of the peninsula. Sturgeon Bay became a shipbuilding capital, housing three major yards. The lively downtown districts on each side of the bay sported the typical hotels, taverns, stores, and blacksmith shops. Residents took pride in their newly formed schools, churches, and public services such as the Pioneer Fire Department. Families, fortunate to live in a land of great natural beauty, enjoyed recreational pursuits in the woods and on the water, whether it was perch fishing early on a summer morning or skating over the ice on a crisp winter afternoon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vA52oQN2fJ8C&dq=Sturgeon+Bay:+Shipbuilding+(Images+of+America:+Wisconsin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"R.N.

How does one deal with a condition one nothing knows about? . . . However much the chemistry of love appears physical, mildly mental, and thrust with an element vaguely referred to as emotion, the fact of the matter, is that love is a mystery. Intrinsic of substance, and made manifest by a host of glorifying virtues through the chain of its \\"Mystic Nature and Component Structure.\\" Of which, Virtue is the key component. In its human equation, love is linked by motivating character; and nobly expresses her bountiful season through the myriad of virtuous human assimilations. And how is this achieved? While love is a gift, for it is known as the sanction of heaven, we must first build it a place in which to abide. Where the modes of character are its means expression. What you know of love, or believe you do, is both physical and sociological. That same quantum and limit to which wild animals and crickets experience. Minus of course, the sociological trauma responsible for tearing relationships apart. . . .Here, a new code of values is mandatory and inherently pertinent to Heaven's greatest gift. \\"The Search for the Ethics of Love\\" is rewardingly based on rock foundation, yet in its simplicity, which is the marrow of its giving, against, the tide of sociological answers, love is turned away again and again. Occurring much as a sacrament, given of holy principle, or in its base opposite, a curse, come of deceiving maneuvers of believed romance, stripped of fidelity, both man and woman hood mootly assume the role of helpless victim. Indeed, much as a herd of prodded cattle to the slaughter. So too, do the lines to the divorce courts grow with the passing hours. Fractured love deserves more than the pitiful ebb tide of flotsam and jetsam. For there are no answers within the numbing disjunction; for love was but a stranger to a hopeless union. Devastating as broken love can be, its stunning recover lies written in the A B C's of love's Mystic Nature and Component Structure.

Years ago, the Great War tore apart the lives of the families living on Manor Park Avenue in South London. Now, as Allied and Axis armies rage across Europe in an even more devastating conflict, the residents of the Avenue struggle to cope with the sacrifices England must make as their nation s place in the world irrevocably changes. Longtime homeowner Jim Carver, who lives in Number Twenty, had his fill of combat in the trenches of France more than twenty years ago. But when the Luftwaffe rains death from above on his beloved street, he dedicates himself to the war effort. Carver s eldest son, Archie, has come a long way from grocer s errand boy to owner of a chain of successful shops. His illicit affair with a neighbor whose husband is fighting for King and Country threatens to undo everything he has achieved. Esther Frith lives a solitary life in Number Seventeen, seemingly oblivious to the aerial onslaught ravaging the Avenue now that the war has turned her family into casualties. And across the road at Number Twenty-Two, reclusive Harold Godbeer hates what the war is doing to his country. He realizes that even if England succeeds in helping defeat the Axis s tyrannical dictators, his nation will be but a shadow of its former glory. Living side by side as their neighborhood becomes a battleground, two generations of Manor Park Avenue must unite if they and their way of life are to survive during wartime, in this moving novel about the connections we forge during times of trouble, which was also adapted for British television.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B67vAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just So Stories for Little Children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2KbzgEACAAJ&dq=Just+So+Stories+for+Little+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex education for the '90s: A practical teacher's guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c804HwAACAAJ&dq=Sex+education+for+the+%2790s:+A+practical+teacher%27s+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets from the Couch","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y00bAAAACAAJ&dq=Secrets+from+the+Couch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What To Do When Your Child Gets Sick (What to Do)","description":"Easy to read book on taking care of a small child.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BGhuDZMamUsC&dq=What+To+Do+When+Your+Child+Gets+Sick+(What+to+Do)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prego!","description":"Prego! is easy to use!

In 1980 an entire body of Jewish literature the physical remnant of Yiddish culture was on the verge of extinction. Precious volumes that had survived Hitler and Stalin were being passed down from older generations of immigrants to their non-Yiddish-speaking children, only to be discarded or destroyed. So Aaron Lansky, a twenty-three-year-old graduate student, issued a worldwide appeal for unwanted Yiddish works. Lansky s passion led him to travel from house to house collecting the books and the stories of these Jewish refugees and the vibrant intellectual world they inhabited. He and a team of volunteers salvaged books from dusty attics, crumbling basements, demolition sites, and dumpsters. When they began, scholars thought that fewer than seventy thousand Yiddish books existed. In fact, Lansky s project would go on to save over 1.5 million volumes, from famous writers like Sholem Aleichem and I. B. Singer to one-of-a-kind Soviet prints. This true account of his journey is both  extraordinary  (The Boston Globe) and  entertaining  (Los Angeles Times).  Lansky charmingly describes his adventures as president and founder of the National Yiddish Book Center, which now has new headquarters at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass. To Lansky, Yiddish literature represented an important piece of Jewish cultural history, a link to the past and a memory of a generation lost to the Holocaust. Lansky s account of salvaging books is both hilarious and moving, filled with Jewish humor, conversations with elderly Jewish immigrants for whom the books evoke memories of a faraway past, stories of desperate midnight rescues from rain-soaked dumpsters, and touching accounts of Lansky s trips to what were once thriving Jewish communities in Europe. The book is a testimony to his love of Judaism and literature and his desire to make a difference in the world.

The result is a scattered and confusing mass of evidence that is difficult to evaluate. How much progress has really been made? Are the neurological causes of madness truly in sight? This book evaluates the progress of schizophrenia science by summarizing what is known about how patients with the illness differ from healthy people. The tools of meta-analysis are first explained and then employed to make the strength and consistency of these differences explicit. Beginning with the study of symptoms, then moving through the search for objective disease markers, findings on the cognitive functions, structure, physiology, chemistry, and development of the brain, this book is a journey into the enigma of madness and its science. What emerges is an illness that reveals itself most strongly in thought processes, not biology. As evidence actually becomes weaker and harder to reproduce as research moves from mind to molecule, the harvest of dazzling research techniques turns out to be modest or inconsistent. Schizophrenia is an anomaly at the frontier of mind and brain, but In Search of Madness points the way to its solution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pIrY28CApGQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Su nombre era muerte (Spanish Edition)","description":"Never before in English, this legendary precursor to eco-fiction turns the coming insect apocalypse on its head A Wall Street Journal Best Science Fiction Book of 2021 A bitter drunk forsakes civilization and takes to the Mexican jungle, trapping animals, selling their pelts to buy liquor for colossal benders, and slowly rotting away in his fetid hut.

Gauri Viswanathan skillfully argues that conversion is an interpretive act that belongs in the realm of cultural criticism. To that end, this work examines key moments in colonial and postcolonial history to show how conversion questions the limitations of secular ideologies, particularly the discourse of rights central to both the British empire and the British nation-state. Implicit in such questioning is an attempt to construct an alternative epistemological and ethical foundation of national community. Viswanathan grounds her study in an examination of two simultaneous and, she asserts, linked events: the legal emancipation of religious minorities in England and the acculturation of colonial subjects to British rule. The author views these two apparently disparate events as part of a common pattern of national consolidation that produced the English state. She seeks to explain why resistance, in both cases, frequently took the form of religious conversion, especially to \\"minority\\" or alternative religions. Confronting the general characterization of conversion as assimilative and annihilating of identity, Viswanathan demonstrates that a willful change of religion can be seen instead as an act of opposition. Outside the Fold concludes that, as a form of cultural crossing, conversion comes to represent a vital release into difference. Through the figure of the convert, Viswanathan addresses the vexing question of the role of belief and minority discourse in modern society. She establishes new points of contact between the convert as religious dissenter and as colonial subject. This convergence provides a transcultural perspective not otherwise visible in literary and historical texts. It allows for radically new readings of significant figures as diverse as John Henry Newman, Pandita Ramabai, Annie Besant, and B. R. Ambedkar, as well as close studies of court cases, census reports, and popular English fiction. These varying texts illuminate the means by which discourses of religious identity are produced, contained, or opposed by the languages of law, reason, and classificatory knowledge. Outside the Fold is a challenging, provocative contribution to the multidisciplinary field of cultural studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZuUXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Damia (Rowan/Damia Series)","description":"A LEGENDARY FAMILY For generations, the descendants of the powerful telepath known as The Rowan have used their talents to benefit humanity.

When he left, it was under FBI escort. Bill was Army Infantry. When his knees gave out, he opened the Drop Zone, a military surplus store in Anchorage, and started hiring fellow vets. Sharpshooting hippies, crew-cutted fundamentalists, PTSD sufferers all seeking purpose and direction. Alaska gave it to them. The Last Frontier is vast. The perfect refuge for fugitives and the perfect place for vets itching for a mission, Alaska is a giant icebox full of people either running to or away from something. More than 400 fugitives would meet Bill and company on the wrong side of a gun, and he would learn many lessons along the way like even tiptoeing through subzero snow can get you shot, and removing a gun from the butt crack of a 300-pound man is just as fun as it sounds. Bill was enjoying the ride until, one day, the FBI asked him to go undercover, and his road forked. Schaeffer Cox was a sovereign citizen who believed no government had authority over him and a private militia commander amassing an arsenal and plotting to kill judges and law enforcement officers. Bill's mission: to take down Cox and his militia without a shot being fired. The Blood of Patriots traverses a wide swath of rugged territory. Raucously funny and stark, it depicts men, once brothers in arms serving their country, who now find themselves on opposite sides of those arms in a deadly test of the intricacies of liberty, the proper role of government, and the true meaning of patriotism. It offers a witty and unsettling look at political rhetoric gone haywire and a movement the FBI considers the single greatest threat to law enforcement in the nation all set in the beautiful, terrifying landscape of our 49th State.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fQs3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Venus Project: The redesign of a culture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pRmdpwAACAAJ&dq=The+Venus+Project:+The+redesign+of+a+culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primary Phonics The Dream Set 3 Book 5","description":"A systematic, phonics-based early reading program that includes: the most practice for every skill, decodable readers for every skill, and reinforcement materials--help struggling students succeed in the regular classroom","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3RKTQAAACAAJ&dq=Primary+Phonics+The+Dream+Set+3+Book+5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Origin of the Bible: A Comprehensive Guide to the Authority and Inspiration of the Bible, the Canon, the Bible as Literary Text, Text and Manuscripts, Translations","description":"Biblical Hermeneutics is a textbook for introductory courses in hermeneutics. It takes an interdisciplinary approach that is both balanced and practical with six major areas of focus: the history of biblical interpretation, philosophical presuppositions, biblical genre, the uniqueness of Scripture, the practice of exegesis, and use of exegetical insights that will be lived and communicated in preaching and teaching. Biblical Hermeneutics is designed for students who have little or no knowledge of biblical interpretation. It provides, in one volume, resources for gaining a working knowledge of the multi-faceted nature of biblical interpretation and for supporting the practice of exegesis on the part of the student. The first chapter \\"A Student's Primer for Exegesis\\" by Bruce Corley gives the student a bird's eye view of the entire process. It becomes for the student a kind of template to which they will return again and again as they engage in the process of exegesis. This revised edition of Biblical Hermeneutics contains seven new chapter that deal with the major literary genre of Scripture: law, narrative, poetry, wisdom, prophecy, Gospels and Acts, epistles, and apocalyptic. The unique nature of Scripture is presented in part three that addresses the authority, inspiration, and language of Scripture. The book contains two extensive appendices, \\"A Student's Glossary for Biblical Studies\\" and an updated and expanded version of \\"A Student's Guide to Reference Books and Biblical Commentaries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WJ-4AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Courage of Captain Plum","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Braddock Essays: 1975-1998","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1hjcHAAACAAJ&dq=Braddock+Essays:+1975-1998&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I will maintain","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aEELAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intermediate Accounting","description":"Revised edition of Intermediate accounting, 2018.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v4_1vQEACAAJ&dq=Intermediate+Accounting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Body Grief","description":"Acknowledging the unique set of symptoms that accompanies a period of mourning, this guide is the ideal companion to weathering the storm of physical distress.

The novel focuses on the entwined stories of James Hallam, a carpenter and indentured servant; Ezekiel, an African slave brought to Maryland from Barbados; and Tawzin, a Piscataway Indian, kidnapped to England when a child, and now back in America. While Hallam goes on to become a soldier and a player in the politics of the Maryland colony, Ezekiel and Tawzin become the center of an outcast group of blacks, whites, and Indians, who find themselves striving to reinvent themselves and their world. The stories of these three men, the women who love them, and the community they form, bring to vivid life the experiences of those who came to America pulled by a dream of what could be shaped from an emptiness that embodied promise, of those who were unwillingly brought to be the instruments of that dream, and of those who saw the shape of their world forever changed by the coming of the Europeans. \\"The Wished For Country illuminates an aspect of our history that we dare not forget.

Philosophical and historical studies)","description":"The title of this book is particularly significant in that Dr. Rushdoony was able to identify the basic contradiction that pervades a secular society that rejects God's sovereignty by still needs law and order, justice, science, and meaning to life. Secular man wants to use the thinks of creation while denying their creator. As Dr. Rushdoony writes, 'there is no law, no society, no justice, no structure, no design, no meaning apart from God.' And so, modern man has become schizophrenic. He wants to assert his autonomy while rejecting the divine order that gives meaning to life. To the humanist, the aim of living is something he calls the 'good life.' For the nihilist, it is violence and death. Dr. Rushdoony saw cultural schizophrenia as a split between thought and feeling, a withdrawal from the reality of God and a flight into fantasies of world government achieved through an unattainable unity. Utopians are undeniably schizophrenic. They want a heaven on earth, which can only be achieved by coercion and enslavement. But perhaps what they really want, as depraved human beings, is coercion and enslavement, and use utopian idealism to deceive and entrap the gullible. Nor is it by accident that the government schools now lavish so much time on death education, which has been marbleized throughout the curriculum. As Dr. Rushdoony writes: 'For man to turn his back on God, therefore, is to turn towards death.' And this is exactly what the government schools have done. Add to this, multiculturalism, transcendental meditation, sensitivity training, explicit sex education, drug education, evolution, behavioral psychology, humanism, whole language, and other such programs, and you get a curriculum that is so profoundly anti-Christian that one wonders how any Christian parent or minister can condone putting a Christian child in a government school from the forward by Samuel L.

We face constant political and economic upheaval, and we're bombarded with information, much of it contradictory. Managing uncertainty--in our jobs, our relationships, and our everyday lives--is fast becoming an essential skill. What should we do when we have no idea what to do? In Nonsense, Jamie Holmes shows how we react to ambiguous situations and how we can do it better. Being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We're hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. But in doing so, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective. Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Whether we're dealing with an unclear medical diagnosis or launching a risky new product, Nonsense promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions. In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn't IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know.

Bernoulli and Euler, created a coherent theory of the mechanics of strings and rods undergoing planar deformations. They introduced the basic con cepts of strain, both extensional and flexural, of contact force with its com ponents of tension and shear force, and of contact couple. They extended Newton's Law of Motion for a mass point to a law valid for any deformable body. Euler formulated its independent and much subtler complement, the Angular Momentum Principle. (Euler also gave effective variational characterizations of the governing equations. ) These scientists breathed life into the theory by proposing, formulating, and solving the problems of the suspension bridge, the catenary, the velaria, the elastica, and the small transverse vibrations of an elastic string. (The level of difficulty of some of these problems is such that even today their descriptions are sel dom vouchsafed to undergraduates. The realization that such profound and beautiful results could be deduced by mathematical reasoning from fundamental physical principles furnished a significant contribution to the intellectual climate of the Age of Reason. ) At first, those who solved these problems did not distinguish between linear and nonlinear equations, and so were not intimidated by the latter. By the middle of the nineteenth century, Cauchy had constructed the basic framework of three-dimensional continuum mechanics on the founda tions built by his eighteenth-century predecessors.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wmjTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Defense","description":"\\"If you're a fan of John Grisham, Scott Turow, and Brad Meltzer, then you will be a fan of Steve Cavanagh's The Defense.\\"  Nelson DeMille, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Radiant Angel Eddie Flynn used to be a con artist.

In The Return of the Shadow (an abandoned title for the first volume) Christopher Tolkien describes, with full citation of the earliest notes, outline plans, and narrative drafts, the intricate evolution of The Fellowship of the Ring and the gradual emergence of the conceptions that transformed what J.R.R. Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book, 'a sequel to The Hobbit'. The enlargement of Bilbo's 'magic ring' into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man. The hobbits, Frodo's companions, undergo intricate permutations of name and personality, and other major figures appear in strange modes: a sinister Treebeard, in league with the Enemy, a ferocious and malevolent Farmer Maggot. The story in this book ends at the point where J.R.R. Tolkien halted in the story for a long time, as the Company of the Ring, still lacking Legolas and Gimli, stood before the tomb of Balin in the Mines of Moria. The Return of the Shadow is illustrated with reproductions of the first maps and notable pages from the earliest manuscripts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0WvqwAEACAAJ&dq=Return+of+the+Shadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooperation or Conflict in the Taiwan Strait?

With The Secret on Ararat following close on the heels of Glorious Appearing, the fastest-selling Left Behind novel ever, Tim LaHaye will further prove to be one of the most fascinating and popular storytellers of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I7BLM5ZfY00C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bonanza Trail: Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of the West","description":"Searching for gold in the American West was not for the faint of heart. To reach the fabled gold fields of California, prospectors penetrated the boundless high Sierras and the Rockies and crossed the desert wastes of Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Waves of would-be miners poured into the golden gulches of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, while others climbed to the deeper mines high in the mountains of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado. Along the way, they made their homes and earned a living in makeshift camps and towns, many of which have since vanished. Written back when old-timers still recalled the glorious ordeal of the Old West and many ruins still stood, The Bonanza Trail endures as a classic of western storytelling. Muriel Sibell Wolle traveled 20,000 miles across 12 western states in search of the legendary mining camps and towns where adventure could happen on a dime and dreams of instant fortune filled the days. The risky but always exciting life in those bustling frontier settlements is memorably captured by Wolle in vivid detail and her extraordinary drawings and paintings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=br1HDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bonanza+Trail:+Ghost+Towns+and+Mining+Camps+of+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pat Sajak's Super Sudoku","description":"Classic Sudoku reaches new heights of entertainment in this collection of number puzzles that incorporates an exclusive  code breaking  puzzle-play system.

Nixon famously declared the 1973 agreement to be \\"peace with honor\\"; America was disengaging, yet South Vietnam still stood to fight its own war. Kissinger promptly moved to seal up his personal records of the negotiations, arguing that they are private, not government, records, and that he will only allow them to be unsealed after his death. No Peace, No Honor deploys extraordinary documentary bombshells, including a complete North Vietnamese account of the secret talks, to blow the lid off the true story of the peace process. Neither Nixon and Kissinger's critics, nor their defenders, have guessed at the full truth: the entire peace negotiation was a sham. Nixon did not plan to exit Vietnam, but he knew that in order to continue bombing without a congressional cutoff, he would need a fig leaf. Kissinger negotiated a deal that he and Nixon expected the North to violate. Ironically, their long-maintained spin on what happened next is partially true: only Watergate stopped America from sending the bombers back in. This revelatory book has many other surprises. Berman produces new evidence that finally proves a long-suspected connection between candidate Nixon in 1968 and the South Vietnamese government. He tells the full story of Operation Duck Hook, a large-scale offensive planned by Nixon as early as 1969 that would have widened the war even to the point of bombing civilian food supplies. He reveals transcripts of candidate George McGovern's attempts to negotiate his own October surprise for 1972, and a seriocomic plan by the CIA to overthrow South Vietnam's President Thieu even as late as 1975. Throughout, with page-turning dialogue provided by official transcriptions and notes, Berman reveals the step-by-step betrayal of South Vietnam that started with a short-circuited negotiations loop, and ended with double-talk, false promises, and outright abandonment. Berman draws on hundreds of declassified documents, including the notes of Kissinger's aides, phone taps of the Nixon campaign in 1968, and McGovern's own transcripts of his negotiations with North Vietnam. He has been able to double- and triple-check North Vietnamese accounts against American notes of meetings, as well as previously released bits of the record. He has interviewed many key players, including high-level South Vietnamese officials. This definitive account forever and completely rewrites the final chapter of the Vietnam war. Henry Kissinger's Nobel Prize was won at the cost of America's honor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CTP9rK50Z8cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advertising Media A-to-Z","description":"Publisher Description","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OcgiAQAAIAAJ&dq=Advertising+Media+A-to-Z&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Baffle Book","description":"Includes fifteen detective puzzles, the unravelling of which requires you to develop your latent powers of observation and deduction.

To develop some form-or forms--of international organization of labor, long an ideological challenge (\\"Workers of the World Unite\\") has now become an urgent matter of survival for the labor movements of the world. Here is a challenge, on which I think broad agreement is possible: Even those who think capitalism is capable of indefinite survival must agree that it has functioned best in the past-for example, during the long period of post-World War II expansion when the power of capital has been effectively limited by the countervailing power of labor. Effective exercise of that power has always depended on overcoming the seg mentation of labor due to such factors as locality, race, gender, occupation, etc. , which stilIremain important. Above, I have singled out the two factors that today seem key to me: the split between mental and manual labor, and segmentation by nationality. Let all concerned about the current state of capitalism work to build up the countervailing power of labor, and let time show whether this results in nothing more than the better functioning of capitalism, or whether a new challenge to the system ultimately emerges.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=izr6CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Necromancers (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 2nd Edition, Dungeon Master Guide Rules Supplement/2151)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRPdPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Necromancers+(Advanced+Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phenomenon of Man","description":"Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ. 1 May 1881  10 April 1955 was a French philosopher and Jesuit priest who trained as a paleontologist and geologist and took part in the discovery of Peking Man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y1AQCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Phenomenon+of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DISTURB NOT THE DREAM","description":"Staying for the season at Mulberry House, the scene of terrible murders nearly forty years before, Dr. Bertram Bradley and his family begin to experience strange and unexplained events","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AMLHAAAACAAJ&dq=DISTURB+NOT+THE+DREAM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cross and its shadow","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The naval officer's guide;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PHtOuQEACAAJ&dq=The+naval+officer%27s+guide%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yalta","description":"Imagine you could eavesdrop on a dinner party with three of the most fascinating historical figures of all time. In this landmark book, a gifted Harvard historian puts you in the room with Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt as they meet at a climactic turning point in the war to hash out the terms of the peace. The ink wasn't dry when the recriminations began. The conservatives who hated Roosevelt's New Deal accused him of selling out. Was he too sick? Did he give too much in exchange for Stalin's promise to join the war against Japan? Could he have done better in Eastern Europe? Both Left and Right would blame Yalta for beginning the Cold War. Plokhy's conclusions, based on unprecedented archival research, are surprising. He goes against conventional wisdom-cemented during the Cold War- and argues that an ailing Roosevelt did better than we think. Much has been made of FDR's handling of the Depression; here we see him as wartime chief. Yalta is authoritative, original, vividly- written narrative history, and is sure to appeal to fans of Margaret MacMillan's bestseller Paris 1919.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9IUBEAAAQBAJ&dq=Yalta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of the Night","description":"A bestseller in 1941, selected by the Book of the Month Club for a special edition and described by Book of the Month Club News as:  ...full of sensational revelations and interspersed with episodes of daring, of desperate conflict, of torture, and of ruthless conspiracy...It is, first of all, an autobiography the like of which has seldom been.  The son of a seafaring father, Richard Julius Herman Krebs, a.k.a. Jan Valtin, came of age as a bicycle messenger during a maritime rebellion. His life as an intimate insider account of the dramatic events of 1920 s and 1930s, where he rose both within the ranks of the Communist Party and on the Gestapo hit list. Known for his honesty and incredible memory, Krebs dedicated his life to the Communist Party, rising to a position as head of maritime, organizing worldwide for the Comintern, only to flee the Party and Europe to evade his own comrade s attempts to kill him. As a professional revolutionary, agitator, spy and would-be assassin, Krebs traveled the globe from Germany to China, India to Sierra Leon, Moscow to the United States where a botched assassination attempt landed him a stint in San Quentin. From his spellbinding account of artful deception to gain release from a Nazi prison and his work as a double-agent within the Gestapo, to his vivid depiction of a Communist Party fraught with intrigue and subterfuge, Krebs gives an unflinching portrayal of the internal machinations of both parties.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7x3TDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives Of Girls And Women","description":"WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE?

Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life.

Within the last forty years face and speaker recognition have emerged as research topics. However, as recently as a decade ago, biometrics itself did not exist as an independent field. Each of the biometric-related topics grew out of different disciplines. For example, the study of fingerprints came from forensics and pattern recognition, speaker recognition evolved from signal processing, the beginnings of face recognition were in computer vision, and privacy concerns arose from the public policy arena. One of the challenges of any new field is to state what the core ideas are that define the field in order to provide a research agenda for the field and identify key research problems. Biometrics has been grappling with this challenge since the late 1990s. With the matu ration of biometrics, the separate biometrics areas are coalescing into the new discipline of biometrics. The establishment of biometrics as a recognized field of inquiry allows the research community to identify problems that are common to biometrics in general. It is this identification of common problems that will define biometrics as a field and allow for broad advancement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DLLbBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garlic, Onion, & Other Alliums","description":"Look at any recipe for a savory dish and chances are it will start with this step: fry onions in a pan over medium heat. Onions and their allium family relatives, shallots, garlic, chives, and leeks are one of the most heavily used ingredients in cuisines all over the world. You ll rarely find them in the spotlight, though except for when they are fried into rings or used to repel vampires. In this book, Martha Jay gives alliums their due, offering an illuminating history of these cherished plants that follows the trail of their aromas to every corner of the globe and from ancient times up to today. Going back to the earliest recipes from ancient Mesopotamia, Jay traces the spread of alliums along trade routes through Central Asia and into ancient Greece and Rome. Likewise she follows their spread in East Asia, where they have become indispensable, and of course into Europe and the Americas, where the onion and its odor gave rise to the name  Chicago  and the leek became the national symbol of Wales. Celebrated, denigrated, prescribed, and proscribed, onions, garlic, and their relatives can be found as Jay lavishly demonstrates in the histories of peasants and kings, in cuisine and art, in tales of colonization and those of resistance, and in medicinal cures and magical potions alike. Her book is a welcome celebration of some of the most important ingredients in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kKozDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SAS Secret War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Difficulty with Dwarves","description":"When a wizard is unable to cure his malady of magicks, he sends his apprentice Wuntnor to seek aid in the distant land of the Eastern Kingdoms which are ripe with fiendish peril.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=54Cy5jVKM9oC&dq=A+Difficulty+with+Dwarves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matthew: A Commentary for Bible Students (Wesleyan Bible Commentary)","description":"A vision of discipleship and how to live when your traditional moorings are under attack","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eenUAAAACAAJ&dq=Matthew:+A+Commentary+for+Bible+Students+(Wesleyan+Bible+Commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Norma Jean","description":"Illus. in full color. \\"Kangaroo child Norma Jean loves to jump.

Building on the now popular idea amongst Alice enthusiasts, that the Alice books - at heart - were intended for adults as well as children, Laura White takes current research in a new, fascinating direction. During the Victorian era of the book s original publication, ideas about nature and our relation to nature were changing drastically. The Alice Books and the Contested Ground of the Natural World argues that Lewis Carroll used the book s charm, wit, and often puzzling conclusions to counter the emerging tendencies of the time which favored Darwinism and theories of evolution and challenged the then-conventional thinking of the relationship between mankind and nature. Though a scientist and ardent student of nature himself, Carroll used his famously playful language, fantastic worlds and brilliant, often impossible characters to support more the traditional, Christian ideology of the time in which mankind holds absolute sovereignty over animals and nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UlAsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Basque Hotel (The Basque Series)","description":"This novel is the first volume in Laxalt's highly acclaimed Basque-family trilogy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LvqGzAEACAAJ&dq=The+Basque+Hotel+(The+Basque+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Puritan Way Of Death: A Study In Religion, Culture, And Social Change","description":"The Puritan Way of Death is more than a book about Puritans or about death.

Charles Farhadian here presents a timely investigation of the interaction between culture and worship. Leading scholars -- experts in history, mission, culture, and liturgy -- offer diverse essays addressing worship in the context of worldwide Christianity. At the heart of Christian Worship Worldwide are several case studies from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific that explore the contours of particular nations, cultures, and liturgical actions. These essays show how Christian plurality is most vividly exemplified in the context of worship, where language, song, culture, and indigenous theology come together. Contributors: M. L.

In Multimedia Learning, Second Edition, Richard E. Mayer examines whether people learn more deeply when ideas are expressed in words and pictures rather than in words alone. He reviews 12 principles of instructional design that are based on experimental research studies and grounded in a theory of how people learn from words and pictures. The result is what Mayer calls the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, a theory first developed in the first edition of Multimedia Learning and further developed in The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yflCPgAACAAJ&dq=Multimedia+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Things, Last Things","description":"Eric Hoffer one of America's most important thinkers and the author of The True Believer begins with a macro view on the progress of civilization, ending with his crucible vision on the unique and transformative aspects of mankind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I6WJOwAACAAJ&dq=First+Things,+Last+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philadelphia Fire : a novel","description":"One of John Wideman s most ambitious and celebrated works, the lyrical masterpiece and PEN/Faulkner winner inspired by the 1985 police bombing of the West Philadelphia row house owned by black liberation group Move.

Shenandoah;: The memoirs of Lieutenant Commanding James I.

The last armed Confederate cruiser was the C.S.S. Shenandoah, a beautiful but dangerous vessel which scattered and burned the New Bedford whaling fleet in Arctic waters. She was the last cruiser sent to sea by James Dunwoody Bulloch, the captain who built the Confederacy s navy in the shipyards of Europe. Constructed at a cost of  53,715, the Shenandoah captured thirty-eight ships and burned thirty-two. She inflicted damage to Union commerce which was officially judged at $1,361,983. She took 1,053 prisoners. In fact, she took so many her skipper, Lieutenant-Commanding James Waddell, had to rig a chain of whaleboats that could be towed along by his vessel, to accommodate captured Union seamen and the crews of the whalers he had burned. A few years after the war, Waddell wrote his account of the Shenandoah s great cruise, and it is published here complete for the first time. He tells of his own career in the United States Navy and in the Confederate Navy, and also of the events leading up to his taking command of the Shenandoah.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cHAdVkOGiWQC&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],E={key:0},I={key:1};function x(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,P)):c("",!0)])}const q=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-04d8aaa2"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/67.md","filePath":"drive/67.md"}'),J={name:"drive/67.md"},R=Object.assign(J,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(q)]))}});export{D as __pageData,R as default};
