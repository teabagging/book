The Catholic Church values both Faith and Reason, and Catholicism has given risen to extraordinary ideas and whole schools of remarkable thought, not just in the distant past but throughout the troubled decades of the twentieth century. Royal presents in a single volume a sweeping but readable account of how Catholic thinking developed in philosophy, theology, Scripture studies, culture, literature, and much more in the twentieth century. This involves great figures, recognized as such both inside and outside the Church, such as Jacques Maritain, Bernard Lonergan, Joseph Pieper, Edith Stein, Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Romano Guardini, Karl Rahner, Henri du Lubac, Karol Wojtyla, Joseph Ratzinger, Hans Urs von Balthasar,Charles Peguy, Paul Claudel, George Bernanos, Francois Mauriac, G. K. Chesterton, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Christopher Dawson, Graham Greene, Sigrid Undset, J. R. R. Tolkien, Czeslaw Milosz, and many more. Royal argues that without rigorous thought, Catholicism  however welcoming and nourishing it might be  would become something like a doctor with a good bedside manner, but who knows little medicine. It has always been the aspiration of the Catholic tradition to unite emotion and intellect, action and contemplation. But unless we know what the tradition has already produced  especially in the work of the great figures of the recent past  we will not be able to answer the challenges that the modern world poses, or even properly recognize the true questions we face. This is a reflective, non-polemical work that brings together various strands of Catholic thought in the twentieth century. A comprehensive guide to the recent past - and the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iAHkCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Catholic+Tradition:+The+Church+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Wonderful Wearables","description":"Shows how to use various craft techniques to decorate men's, women's, and children's clothing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oE4sEPytC1gC&dq=The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Wonderful+Wearables&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Y Geiriadur Mawr-Welsh/English Dictionay (Dictionary)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UdQ_AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Billy Goat Hill","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Q8XAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mention my name in Atlantis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3oCDAAAACAAJ&dq=Mention+my+name+in+Atlantis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designation Gold (Rogue Warrior)","description":"The Rogue Warrior has come to Moscow to investigate the assassination of Paul Mahon, U.S. Defense attach  in Russia.

English society was broken apart, its systems turned on their head. What is little known is that a fractured network of guerrilla fighters took up arms against the French occupiers. In The Wake, a postapocalyptic novel set a thousand years in the past, Paul Kingsnorth brings this dire scenario back to us through the eyes of the unforgettable Buccmaster, a proud landowner bearing witness to the end of his world. Accompanied by a band of like-minded men, Buccmaster is determined to seek revenge on the invaders. But as the men travel across the scorched English landscape, Buccmaster becomes increasingly unhinged by the immensity of his loss, and their path forward becomes increasingly unclear. Written in what the author describes as \\"a shadow tongue\\" a version of Old English updated so as to be understandable to the modern reader The Wake renders the inner life of an Anglo-Saxon man with an accuracy and immediacy rare in historical fiction. To enter Buccmaster's world is to feel powerfully the sheer strangeness of the past.

Kennedy. Edward Laxton conducted five years of research in Ireland and interviewed the emigrants' descents in the U.S. Portraits of people, ships, and towns, as well as facsimile passenger lists and tickets, are among the fascinating memorabilia in The Famine Ships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ZXWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concise Dictionary of Theology (Stimulus Book)","description":"\\"This third edition identifies and clarifies a thousand central theological terms, providing necessary information about their origin, the history of their usage, and their place in the story of Christianity.

Published in 1961, Reality in Advertising was listed for weeks on the general best-seller lists, and is today acknowledged to be advertising's greatest classic. It has been translated into twelve languages-French, Japanese, Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Hebrew-and has been published in twenty-one separate editions in fifteen countries. Leading business executives, and the advertising cognoscenti, hail it as \\"the best book for professionals that has ever come out of Madison Avenue.\\" (For typical comments see back of jacket.) Rosser Reeves says: \\"The book attempts to formulate certain theories of advertising, many quite new, and all based on 30 years of intensive research.\\" These theories, whose value has been proved in the marketplace, all revolve around the central concept that success in selling a product is the key criterion of advertising. In the course of explaining his own hard-headed approach, Mr. Reeves shows why the ad campaigns for many products are just so much money poured down the drain. He has some devastating things to say about advertising's misguided men: the \\"aesthetes\\" and the \\"puffers\\" who put art and technique ahead of the client's sales; and he punctures many of the misguided philosophies which lower the efficiency of advertising, rather than raising it. But even more important is the thoroughness and clarity with which he explains many of the mysteries of how to write advertising that produces these sales. Here, in short, is a concise, forcefully written guide that has been called \\"a 'Rosetta Stone' for the advertising business\\"- an essential book for anyone who works in advertising, or uses advertising extensively. It is today required reading in hundreds of great corporations and many of the world's leading business schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xL__sgEACAAJ&dq=Reality+in+Advertising&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning to Program with VISUAL BASIC.Net","description":"Most Visual Basic .NET books are written for experienced object-oriented programmers, but many programmers jumping on the .NET bandwagon are coming from non-object-oriented languages, such as Visual Basic 6.0 or from script programming, such as JavaScript.

It won six Oscars and has been hailed as the greatest action film ever, but it is a miracle Mad Max: Fury Road ever made it to the screen  or that anybody survived the production. The story of this modern classic spanned nearly two decades of wild obstacles as visionary director George Miller tried to mount one of the most difficult shoots in Hollywood history. Production stalled several times, stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron clashed repeatedly in the brutal Namib Desert, and Miller s crew engineered death-defying action scenes that were among the most dangerous ever committed to film. Even accomplished Hollywood figures are flummoxed by the accomplishment: As the director Steven Soderbergh has said,  I don t understand how they re not still shooting that film, and I don t understand how hundreds of people aren t dead.  Kyle Buchanan takes readers through every step of that moviemaking experience in vivid detail, from Fury Road s unexpected origins through its outlandish casting process to the big-studio battles that nearly mutilated a masterpiece. But he takes the deepest dive in reporting the astonishing facts behind a shoot so unconventional that the film s fantasy world began to bleed into the real lives of its cast and crew. As they fought and endured in a wasteland of their own, the only way forward was to have faith in their director s mad vision. But how could Miller persevere when almost everything seemed to be stacked against him? With hundreds of exclusive interviews and details about the making of Fury Road, readers will be left with one undeniable conclusion: There has never been a movie so drenched in sweat, so forged by fire, and so epic in scope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3uMoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect (Daw Book Collectors)","description":"Explores the themes of time travel, time paradoxes, and alternate universes in an anthology of original short fiction by such authors as Kathryn Rusch, Diane Duane, Dean Wesley Smith, and James P.

Why has one game, alone among the thousands of games invented and played throughout human history, not only survived but thrived within every culture it has touched? What is it about its thirty-two figurative pieces, moving about its sixty-four black and white squares according to very simple rules, that has captivated people for nearly 1,500 years? Why has it driven some of its greatest players into paranoia and madness, and yet is hailed as a remarkably powerful intellectual tool? Nearly everyone has played chess at some point in their lives. Its rules and pieces have served as a metaphor for society, influencing military strategy, mathematics, artificial intelligence, and literature and the arts. It has been condemned as the devil s game by popes, rabbis, and imams, and lauded as a guide to proper living by other popes, rabbis, and imams. Marcel Duchamp was so absorbed in the game that he ignored his wife on their honeymoon. Caliph Muhammad al-Amin lost his throne (and his head) trying to checkmate a courtier. Ben Franklin used the game as a cover for secret diplomacy.In his wide-ranging and ever-fascinating examination of chess, David Shenk gleefully unearths the hidden history of a game that seems so simple yet contains infinity. From its invention somewhere in India around 500 A.D., to its enthusiastic adoption by the Persians and its spread by Islamic warriors, to its remarkable use as a moral guide in the Middle Ages and its political utility in the Enlightenment, to its crucial importance in the birth of cognitive science and its key role in the aesthetic of modernism in twentieth-century art, to its twenty-first-century importance in the development of artificial intelligence and use as a teaching tool in inner-city America, chess has been a remarkably omnipresent factor in the development of civilization. Indeed, as Shenk shows, some neuroscientists believe that playing chess may actually alter the structure of the brain, that it may be for individuals what it has been for civilization: a virus that makes us smarter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zGUvcnBJVQ8C&dq=The+Immortal+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"California cooking with Betty Evans","description":"A unique collection of recipes reflecting the spirit of California kitchens.

While it did not restore the old order in the South, or restore the South to parity with the Union, it did lay down the political foundations for reunion, bring Reconstruction to an end, and shape the future of four million freedmen. Originally published in 1951, this classic work by one of America's foremost experts on Southern history presents an important new interpretation of the Compromise, forcing historians to revise previous attitudes towards the Reconstruction period, the history of the Republican party, and the realignment of forces that fought the Civil War. Because much of the negotiating occurred in secrecy, historians have known less about this Compromise than others before it.

In Companion Through the Darkness, Stephanie Ericsson defines grief as \\"the constant reawakening that things are now different.\\" Using a very simple format -- which combines excerpts from her own diary writings with brief essays -- she vividly speaks the language of loss and captures the contradictory, wrenching, and chaotic emotions of grief.

I no longer belong to anyone. Rage: The state I use to survive seemingly moments of intolerable pain. Humor: The backside of agony. Pity: The look on people's faces when they haven't a clue what to say to me. Transition: The moments, strung out over months, when I know I am no longer the woman I was, but not quite the woman I am becoming.

Through this medium, multiple visions and disparate voices have attempted to stake a place in viewer consumption. Yet even as this programming supposedly reflects characteristics of the general American populace, television-generated images are manipulated and contradictory, predicated by the various economic, political, and cultural forces placed upon it. In Shaded Lives, Beretta Smith-Shomade sets out to dissect images of the African American woman in television from the 1980s. She calls their depiction \\"binaristic,\\" or split. African American women, although an essential part of television programming today, are still presented as distorted and deviant. By closely examining the television texts of African-American women in comedy, music video, television news and talk shows (Oprah Winfrey is highlighted), Smith-Shomade shows how these voices are represented, what forces may be at work in influencing these images, and what alternate ways of viewing might be available. Smith-Shomade offers critical examples of where the sexist and racist legacy of this country collide with the cultural strength of Black women in visual and real-lived culture. As the nation's climate of heightened racial divisiveness continues to relegate the representation of Black women to depravity and display, her study is not only useful, it is critical.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EYWztR8Vj9EC&dq=Shaded+Lives:+African+American+Women+and+Television&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"India: Journey Through the Heart of a Continent","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=76QYtAEACAAJ&dq=India:+Journey+Through+the+Heart+of+a+Continent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talmud for Everyday Living: Insights into Buying and Selling (Talmud for Everyday Living)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8R8RjwEACAAJ&dq=Talmud+for+Everyday+Living:+Insights+into+Buying+and+Selling+(Talmud+for+Everyday+Living)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fools Crow (Contemporary American Fiction)","description":"The 25th-anniversary edition of \\"a novel that in the sweep and inevitability of its events...is a major contribution to Native American literature.\\" (Wallace Stegner) In the Two Medicine Territory of Montana, the Lone Eaters, a small band of Blackfeet Indians, are living their immemorial life.

This radical question has unleashed a flood of opinions from Americans struggling with the contentious challenges of education reform. There has been plenty of heat over charter schools and their implications, but, until now, not much light. This important new book supplies plenty of illumination. Charter schools--independently operated public schools of choice--have existed in the United States only since 1992, yet there are already over 1,500 of them. How are they doing? Here prominent education analysts Chester Finn, Bruno Manno, and Gregg Vanourek offer the richest data available on the successes and failures of this exciting but controversial approach to education reform. After studying one hundred schools, interviewing hundreds of participants, surveying thousands more, and analyzing the most current data, they have compiled today's most authoritative, comprehensive explanation and appraisal of the charter phenomenon. Fact-filled, clear-eyed, and hard-hitting, this is the book for anyone concerned about public education and interested in the role of charter schools in its renewal. Can charter schools boost student achievement, drive educational innovation, and develop a new model of accountability for public schools? Where did the idea of charter schools come from? What would the future hold if this phenomenon spreads? These are some of the questions that this book answers. It addresses pupil performance, enrollment patterns, school start-up problems, charges of inequity, and smoldering political battles. It features close-up looks at five real--and very different--charter schools and two school districts that have been deeply affected by the charter movement, including their setbacks and triumphs. After outlining a new model of education accountability and describing how charter schools often lead to community renewal, the authors take the reader on an imaginary tour of a charter-based school system. Charter schools are the most vibrant force in education today. This book suggests that their legacy will consist not only of helping millions of families obtain a better education for their children but also in renewing American public education itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TafNTtqsdLIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems of A.

This  powerful and disconcerting  novel by the Booker Prize-winning author of The Children Act and Atonement (The Daily Telegraph) tells the story of a dying family who live in a dying part of the city. A father of four children decides, in an effort to make his garden easier to control, to pave it over. In the process, he has a heart attack and dies, leaving the cement garden unfinished and the children to the care of their mother. Soon after, the mother too dies and the children, fearful of being separated by social services, decide to cover up their parents  deaths: they bury their mother in the cement garden. The story is told from the point of view of Jack, one of the sons, who is entering adolescence with all of its attendant curiosity and appetites. Julie, the eldest, is almost a grown woman. Sue is rather bookish and observes all that goes on around her. And Tom is the youngest and the baby of the lot. The children seem to manage in this perverse setting rather well until Julie brings home a boyfriend who threatens their secret by asking too many questions.  [A] beautiful but disturbing novel.

Based on oral history interviews and new archival sources, it examines the ideas, experiences, and repertoires of center-right students in this age of protest. Writing these activists back into the history of 1968 and its afterlives -including student protest, cultural revolt, internationalism, debates about left-wing violence and the terror of the Red Army Faction, the memory wars of the 1980s and beyond - reveals that this was a broader, more versatile, and, ultimately, more consequential phenomenon than the traditionally narrower focus on a left-wing minority allows. Other '68ers demonstrates that we need a more nuanced history of the 1968 generation and of generational conflict during these years. Student activists comprised individuals from across the political spectrum, who often had very different ideas about what kind of a society they envisaged and how to address the shortcomings of West German democracy. 1968 was a moment of intense political conflict, but it also played out within the student body and nurtured contrasting identities. This book shows that the center-right involvement in 1968 had real consequences. Many of the protagonists of this book would go on to pursue high-profile political careers and leave their mark on West German political culturey. Other '68ers therefore sheds fresh light on how West Germany's center-right dealt with the crisis of hegemony and political identity it experienced in the wake of 1968, how it coped with generational change, how it transformed and modernized after losing power at the national level for the first time in 1969, and how it managed to re-emerge so successfully in the 1980s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xnwpEAAAQBAJ&dq=Playboy+Adult+Magazine:November+1969&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Retire Rich in a Totally Changed World: Why You're Not in Kansas Anymore","description":"Whether you are thirty years from retirement or it s just around the corner, here is the only book you ll need about how to get it together and plan a safe, secure, and prosperous retirement.

Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. \\"The Art of Dealing With People\\" gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible! Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it. As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task. Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who \\"has a way,\\" but it doesn't work for you. The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time. Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him. The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people.

In the early decades of the nineteenth century, New York City's black community strove to realize what freedom meant, to find a new sense of itself, and, in the process, created a vibrant urban culture. Through exhaustive research, Shane White imaginatively recovers the raucous world of the street, the elegance of the city's African American balls, and the grubbiness of the Police Office. It allows us to observe the style of black men and women, to watch their public behavior, and to hear the cries of black hawkers, the strident music of black parades, and the sly stories of black conmen. Taking center stage in this story is the African Company, a black theater troupe that exemplified the new spirit of experimentation that accompanied slavery's demise. For a few short years in the 1820s, a group of black New Yorkers, many of them ex-slaves, challenged pervasive prejudice and performed plays, including Shakespearean productions, before mixed race audiences. Their audacity provoked feelings of excitement and hope among blacks, but often of disgust by many whites for whom the theater's existence epitomized the horrors of emancipation. Stories of Freedom in Black New York brilliantly intertwines black theater and urban life into a powerful interpretation of what the end of slavery meant for blacks, whites, and New York City itself. White's story of the emergence of free black culture offers a unique understanding of emancipation's impact on everyday life, and on the many forms freedom can take.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QcMCnWGTMYMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You and the Year 2000: A Practical Guide for Things that Matter","description":"The Y2K Problem, also referred to as the Y2K Bug, theYear-2000 Problem and the Millennium Problem, is a date-related problem affecting many computers.

The story of the battle which he fought on the previous day and of the short campaign and horrifying retreat which preceded it is, however, not so well known. The Battle of Corunna saved a British army from annihilation and resulted in the tragic death of one of England s finest generals. Setting out from Lisbon in the autumn of 1808, Sir John Moore had marched his army into Spain against Napoleon and by a daring manoeuvre had thrown it across the line of French communications. But, having thus drawn off Napoleon s army from Madrid, Moore found himself so outnumbered and with no hope of assistance from the ineffectual Spanish armies, that he decided to withdraw to the coast. After a 250-mile retreat across the mountains of Galicia under appalling weather conditions, with inadequate food supplies and the French hard on his heels, he eventually reached the port of Corunna. Here he turned and drew up his depleted forces to face Marshal Soult s massive army; and, though mortally wounded in the ensuing battle, he lived long enough to learn that the French had been checked and that his own army would be able to embark in safety. In Corunna extensive use is made of the many eyewitness accounts which survive in the form of official despatches, histories, diaries, memoirs and letters. With the aid of these, Christopher Hibbert not only shows a remarkable understanding of John Moore and his fellow officers, of their conflicting characters and views, but also provides a horrifying picture of the hardships of this brief and bitter campaign.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_gwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Biz: The Basic Business, Legal and Financial Aspects of the Film Industry","description":"Today's film industry is a legal & financial obstacle course that all independent filmmakers must learn to master.

Joseph J. Ellis, author of Founding Brothers A magnificent account of the revolution in arms and consciousness that gave birth to the American republic. When Abraham Lincoln sought to define the significance of the United States, he naturally looked back to the American Revolution. He knew that the Revolution not only had legally created the United States, but also had produced all of the great hopes and values of the American people. Our noblest ideals and aspirations-our commitments to freedom, constitutionalism, the well-being of ordinary people, and equality-came out of the Revolutionary era. Lincoln saw as well that the Revolution had convinced Americans that they were a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty. The Revolution, in short, gave birth to whatever sense of nationhood and national purpose Americans have had. No doubt the story is a dramatic one: Thirteen insignificant colonies three thousand miles from the centers of Western civilization fought off British rule to become, in fewer than three decades, a huge, sprawling, rambunctious republic of nearly four million citizens. But the history of the American Revolution, like the history of the nation as a whole, ought not to be viewed simply as a story of right and wrong from which moral lessons are to be drawn. It is a complicated and at times ironic story that needs to be explained and understood, not blindly celebrated or condemned. How did this great revolution come about? What was its character? What were its consequences? These are the questions this short history seeks to answer. That it succeeds in such a profound and enthralling way is a tribute to Gordon Wood s mastery of his subject, and of the historian s craft.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=62pyqvDuDMUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cupid : The Bewildering Bequest","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s953rL29BE4C&dq=Cupid+:+The+Bewildering+Bequest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When God Doesn't Answer Your Prayer","description":"More than a decade ago, Jerry Sittser prayed for the protection of his family, yet three of his loved ones--his daughter, his wife, and his mother--died in an automobile accident. What went wrong? \\"Why wasn't my prayer answered?\\" he asks. \\"It is no longer an abstract question to me. What should we do and how should we respond when our prayers--prayers that seem right and true and good--go unanswered?\\" In When God Doesn't Answer Your Prayer, Sittser continues exploring the issues he addressed in A Grace Disguised. He asks, \\"Why doesn't God answer our prayers? What, if anything, can we do about it?\\" Sittser is intensely committed to exploring the Christian faith, especially when it doesn't seem to \\"work.\\" In this thoughtful and beautifully written book, he moves beyond easy answers and religious formulas to explore the goodness and greatness of a God who cannot be controlled but can be trusted. When God Doesn't Answer Your Prayer takes an honest and probing look at the problem of unanswered prayer. In doing so, it draws us ever deeper into a relationship with the God who is the end of all our prayers, the object of our faith, the one who fulfills our deepest longings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WL2ldRdKwMkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"7 Days of Creation (GodCounts Series)","description":"Very simple text describes how God created the stars, sun, animals, man, and trees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8xVPQAACAAJ&dq=7+Days+of+Creation+(GodCounts+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Bourdieu","description":"Bourdieu's work is formidable - the journey is tough.

These examples are deployed very well indeed - rather than being tacked-on illustrations of an idea, they are instead used at the heart of the explanation of the ideas'\\" - David Gauntlett, Leeds University \\" Now considered one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, Pierre Bourdieu has left his mark on most of the 'big' theoretical issues in the world of contemporary theory: gender, subjectivity, the body, culture, citizenship, and globalization. His terms are now commonplace: 'social capital', 'cultural capital', 'field', and 'habitus'. Bourdieu examines how people conduct their lives in relation to one another and to major social institutions. He argues that culture and education aren't simply minor influences, but as important as economics in determining differences between groups of people. Unlike the other grand systematisers Marx and Foucault, Bourdieu has tested these arguments in detailed fieldwork. His range is eclectic, his vision is vast, and his writing is often dense and challenging. Understanding Bourdieu offers a comprehensive introduction to Bourdieu's work. It is essential reading for anyone tackling him for the first time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3kaKFL5ZTuUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lines Around China","description":"All Eyes East: How Chinese Youth will Revolutionize Global Marketing provides brands looking to capitalize on this new world order with the insight they need to understand and capture the world's most powerful audience.

Drawing on personal interviews, school census and missionary records, private letters, and a wealth of other sources, Deutsch traces developments from one state to the next, and from one decade to the next, providing an important contribution to the history of the Southwest, race relations, labor, agriculture, women, and Chicanos.--Publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kXTvwAEACAAJ&dq=No+Separate+Refuge:+Culture,+Class,+and+Gender+on+an+Anglo-Hispanic+Frontier+in+the+American+Southwest,+1880-1940&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Series 7 Securities Licensing Review Questions Exam Cram","description":"Rich Majka is a seasoned securities analyst and licensed Series 7 dealer.

It seems like a simple question, yet it has been known to incite some heated responses, even in the church. How are we to formulate a clear, biblical understanding of the gospel? Tradition, reason, and experience all leave us ultimately disappointed. If we want answers, we must turn to the Word of God. Greg Gilbert does so in What Is the Gospel? Beginning with Paul's systematic presentation of the gospel in Romans and moving through the sermons in Acts, Gilbert argues that the central structure of the gospel consists of four main subjects: God, man, Christ, and a response. The book carefully examines each and then explores the effects the gospel can have in individuals, churches, and the world. Both Christian and non-Christian readers will gain a clearer understanding of the gospel in this valuable resource.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SXxbCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN Enchanting Minx (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Disguising her true heritage in order to marry a titled gentleman, Miss Jane Ravenwood finds her scheme going awry when she becomes enamored with her cousin's would-be suitor, the handsome Marquess of Blackmoore.

Her meteoric rise to stardom in the mid-1970s was nothing short of phenomenal, and hits poured forth that pushed her to the top of the charts, including \\"Honey Bee,\\" \\"I Got You Under My Skin,\\" \\"Never Can Say Goodbye,\\" and the song that has immortalized her, \\"I Will Survive,\\" which became a #1 international gold seller. With that song, Gloria heralded the international rise of disco that became synonymous with a way of life in the fast lane - the sweaty bodies at Studio 54, the lines of cocaine, the indescribable feeling that you could always be at the top of your game and never come down. But down she came after her early stardom, and problems followed in the wake, including the death of her mother, whose love had anchored the young singer, as well as constant battles with weight, drugs, and alcohol. While her fans always imagined her to be rich, her personal finances collapsed due to poor management; and while many envied her, she felt completely empty inside. In the early 1980s, sustained by her marriage to music publisher Linwood Simon, Gloria took three years off and reflected upon her life. She visited churches and revisited her mother's old Bible. Discovering the world of gospel, she made a commitment to Christ that sustains her to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjauAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Mother's Youngest Child [Paperback] by Moeri, Louise","description":"The grumpy old woman had never properly celebrated Christmas until the year Star Mother's youngest child came to Earth to find out what Christmas was all about. \\"Word and picture perfect.\\" -- Booklist, starred review","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tTGkQgAACAAJ&dq=Star+Mother%27s+Youngest+Child+%5BPaperback%5D+by+Moeri,+Louise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BASIC HOUSE WIRING","description":"The expanded and revised edition of this reference on traditional wiring includes all the tried-and-true projects from earlier editions that are updated to feature the latest fixtures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WxPDzgEACAAJ&dq=BASIC+HOUSE+WIRING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chasing Destiny","description":"With prose  hot enough to scorch fingers, * Eric Jerome Dickey has electrified readers with his New York Times bestsellers.

Author Laurence Rees argues that the roots of political propaganda lie in Nazi Germany with Hitler s master of visual propaganda, Dr Josef Goebbels. Goebbels  passion for cinema led him to discover the  Great Truth , namely that in order for film propaganda to persuade it must entertain rather than inform. Over the past thirty years the use of film and television propaganda had flourished, particularly in the United States where a candidate s ability to woo voters on the screen is fundamental to his success in a presidential election. Rees shows how television manipulates its viewers into making judgements based purely on the visual image and explains why propaganda works best when it engages the emotions rather than the intellect. We see clearly how these insidious techniques have also played a key role in contemporary British politics as consultants have followed the example of their American counterparts. Written in1992, a year that encompassed a general election in Britain and a presidential election in the United States, Selling Politics is a book for our times. It will fascinate readers who care about the practice of politics and the way democracy functions as the 21st century approaches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DJaAlXeFB3MC&dq=Selling+Politics:+Accompanies+the+TV+Series+We+Have+Ways+of+Making+You+Think&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The effective executive","description":"The measure of the executive, Peter Drucker reminds us, is the ability to 'get the right things done'. Usually this involves doing what other people have overlooked, as well as avoiding what is unproductive. He identifies five talents as essential to effectiveness, and these can be learned; in fact, they must be learned just as scales must be mastered by every piano student regardless of his natural gifts. Intelligence, imagination and knowledge may all be wasted in an executive job without the acquired habits of mind that convert these into results. One of the talents is the management of time. Another is choosing what to contribute to the particular organization. A third is knowing where and how to apply your strength to best effect. Fourth is setting up the right priorities. And all of them must be knitted together by effective decision-making. How these can be developed forms the main body of the book. The author ranges widely through the annals of business and government to demonstrate the distinctive skill of the executive. He turns familiar experience upside down to see it in new perspective. The book is full of surprises, with its fresh insights into old and seemingly trite situations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=THhQDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+effective+executive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eve's Herbs: A History of Contraception and Abortion in the West","description":"In Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance, John Riddle showed, through extraordinary scholarly sleuthing, that women from ancient Egyptian times to the fifteenth century had relied on an extensive pharmacopoeia of herbal abortifacients and contraceptives to regulate fertility. In Eve's Herbs, Riddle explores a new question: If women once had access to effective means of birth control, why was this knowledge lost to them in modern times? Beginning with the testimony of a young woman brought before the Inquisition in France in 1320, Riddle asks what women knew about regulating fertility with herbs and shows how the new intellectual, religious, and legal climate of the early modern period tended to cast suspicion on women who employed \\"secret knowledge\\" to terminate or prevent pregnancy. Knowledge of the menstrual-regulating qualities of rue, pennyroyal, and other herbs was widespread through succeeding centuries among herbalists, apothecaries, doctors, and laywomen themselves, even as theologians and legal scholars began advancing the idea that the fetus was fully human from the moment of conception. Drawing on previously unavailable material, Riddle reaches a startling conclusion: while it did not persist in a form that was available to most women, ancient knowledge about herbs was not lost in modern times but survived in coded form. Persecuted as \\"witchcraft\\" in centuries past and prosecuted as a crime in our own time, the control of fertility by \\"Eve's herbs\\" has been practiced by Western women since ancient times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VSEsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality","description":"Based on Foucault's 1978 and 1979 lectures on rationalities of government, this work examines the art or activity of government and the different ways in which it has been made thinkable and practicable.

G. Lord was becoming a teenager in Southern California and her mother was dying of cancer, Lord's father-an archetypal, remote, rocket engineer- disappeared into his work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, building the space probes of the Mariner Mars 69 mission. Thirty years later, Lord found herself reporting on the JPL, triggering childhood memories and a desire to revisit her past as a way of understanding the ethos of rocket science. Astro Turf is the brilliant result of her journey of discovery. Remembering her pain at her father's absence, yet intrigued by what he did, Lord captures him on the page as she recalls her own youthful, eccentric fascination with science and space exploration. Into her family's saga she weaves the story of the legendary JPL- examining the complexities of its cultural history, from its start in 1936 to the triumphant Mars landings in 2004. She illuminates its founder, Frank Malina, whose brilliance in rocketry was shadowed by a flirtation with communism, driving him from the country even as we welcomed Wernher von Braun and his Nazi colleagues. Lord's own love of science fiction becomes a lens through which she views a profound cultural shift in the male-dominated world of space. And in pursuing the cause of her father's absence she stumbles on a hidden guilt, understanding \\"the anguish his proud silence caused both him and me, and how rooted that silence was in the culture of engineering.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pmQ8ot1imgMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Al Jazeera Phenomenon: Critical Perspectives on New Arab Media","description":"Few phenomena in the Arab world are more controversial than Al Jazeera - the satellite television news channel that, despite its brief history, has made its impact known throughout the world and changed the face of a formerly parochial Arab media.This timely collection of articles, many by Arabic-speaking scholars, gives us more information and analysis of the network - and how it has affected the public and even the foreign policies of Western governments - than any other of the very few books published in English up to now.The book provides rare insights into Al Jazeera's politics, its agenda, its programs, its coverage of regional crises, and its treatment of the West. The authors attempt to gauge the station's impact on ordinary Arab viewers, understand its effect on an increasingly visible Arab public sphere, and map out the role it plays in regional Arab politics. The image of Al Jazeera that emerges from this book is much more complex than its depiction in American media. It reveals the powerful role that the network plays in shaping ideas and reconstructing Arab identities during a crucial juncture in Middle Eastern history and politics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jAKaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silenced: International Journalists Expose Media Censorship","description":"...interesting and comprehensive and offers compelling insights into the struggles and persecution faced by international journalists, as well as the methods used to uncover truths. Silenced reads like a psychological thriller too engrossing to put down complete with police corruption, drug trafficking, murder, embezzlement and war. It is a story of briefings and press releases, unwritten newsroom rules, unpopular editorial decisions and (ineffective) freedom of information laws. It is about protecting sources or facing jail time. It is about silencing and unsilencing and the risk of both. Most importantly, Silenced is about the horror of seeing it all and the power of reporting it.- ClamorThis hard-hitting collection shows that pressure and persecution are still inescapable aspects of a journalist's job description ... a vigorous defense of press freedoms by journalists who are unafraid to confront the powers that be.- Publishers WeeklyWhat happens to journalists who expose uncomfortable truths? How far are journalists prepared to go in order to report a difficult story? Silenced provides answers to these questions with the stories of journalists who risked their careers so that the public might be informed.From China, where Jasper Becker, formerly Beijing bureau chief of the South China Morning Post, fought a lonely and unsuccessful battle against owners willing to soften the newspaper's reporting of the Chinese government in the hope of protecting mainland investments, to Zimbabwe where the harsh treatment of the Guardian's Andrew Meldrum led to him being arrested and forcibly deported from the country because he dared criticize President Robert Mugabe, Silenced is a forcible reminder of the risks - both personal and financial - accepted by the media on our behalf.Elsewhere, in other parts of the world, journalists face more traditional problems, whether it is the pressure placed on journalists Gary Hughes and Gerard Ryle when highlighting police corruption in Australia, or the aggressive tactics employed by the Belgian authorities against Stern magazine's Hans-Martin Tillack for exposing a financial scandal at the heart of the European Union.When faced with the threat of censorship, all of these journalists reacted in a similar manner - they chose to report and face the consequences. They decided to place the ethics of journalism above all other considerations. As such they are proof that press freedom cannot exist without those who are willing to uphold its fundamental principals.Silenced is more than a book on the media; it is an expression of the bravery and persistence of journalists everywhere.David Dadge (Vienna, Austria) is the editor at the International Press Institute and the author of Silenced: International Journalists Expose Media Censorship.

After his opening chapters on the political, social, and economic basis of town life, Mack Walker traces a painful process of decline that, while occasionally slowed or diverted, leads inexorably toward death and, in the twentieth century, transfiguration. Along the way, he addresses such topics as local government, corporate economies, and communal society. Equally important, he illuminates familiar aspects of German history in compelling ways, including the workings of the Holy Roman Empire, the Napoleonic reforms, and the revolution of 1848. Finally, Walker examines German liberalism's underlying problem, which was to define a meaning of freedom that would make sense to both the \\"movers and doers\\" at the center and the citizens of the home towns. In the book's final chapter, Walker traces the historical extinction of the towns and their transformation into ideology. From the memory of the towns, he argues, comes Germans' \\"ubiquitous yearning for organic wholeness,\\" which was to have its most sinister expression in National Socialism's false promise of a racial community. A path-breaking work of scholarship when it was first published in 1971, German Home Towns remains an influential and engaging account of German history, filled with interesting ideas and striking insights on cameralism, the baroque, Biedermeier culture, legal history and much more. In addition to the inner workings of community life, this book includes discussions of political theorists like Justi and Hegel, historians like Savigny and Eichhorn, philologists like Grimm. Walker is also alert to powerful long-term trends the rise of bureaucratic states, the impact of population growth, the expansion of markets and no less sensitive to the textures of everyday life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kOKpBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Optical Properties of Photonic Crystals (Springer Series in Optical Sciences)","description":"Deals not only with the properties of the radiation modes inside the crystals but also with their peculiar optical response to external fields.

It lifts the veil on the global networks of parafascist terrorists who so frequently plot and murder with impunity, thanks to their relationships and services to the intelligence agencies of the so-called \\"free world.\\" In short, this updated edition tells a story which our own media have systematically failed to tell.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9tZCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cowboy At Work: All About His Job And How He Does It","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pj8iAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Cowboy+At+Work:+All+About+His+Job+And+How+He+Does+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Miranda,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fcZmAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+life+of+Miranda,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Endless Search: A Memoir","description":"Poet David Ray, two-time winner of the William Carlos Williams Award,hronicles his efforts to overcome the abuse and poverty of his childhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fy5bAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Endless+Search:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dead Cure","description":"The film adaptation of Dashner's third installment of his #1 \\"New York Times\\"-bestselling Maze Runner series hits theaters on January 26.

In the horrifying opening paragraph of A Killing Spring, Reed Gallagher, the head of the School of Journalism at the university where Joanne Kilbourn teaches, is found dead in a seedy rooming house. He is dressed in women s lingerie, with an electric cord around his neck. Suicide, the police say. A clear case of accidental suicide. But for Joanne, who takes on the thankless task of breaking the news to Gallagher s wife, this death is just the first in a series of misfortunes that rock her life, both professional and personal. A few days after Gallagher s death, the School of Journalism is vandalized  its offices and computers are trashed, and homophobic graffiti are sprayed everywhere. Then an unattractive and unpopular journalism student in Joanne s politics class stops coming to school after complaining to an unbelieving Joanne that she s being sexually harassed. Clearly, all is not as well at the university as Joanne had thought. Nor is all well in her love life after the casual racism of a stranger drives a wedge between Joanne and her lover, Inspector Alex Kequahtooway. To make matters worse, Joanne is unceremoniously fired by her best friend from the weekly political panel on Nationtv, which she s being doing for years. Badly shaken by these calamities, Joanne struggles to carry cheerfully on. Action, she knows, is better for her than moping. She decides to find out why her student has stopped coming to class, and in doing so, Joanne steps unknowingly into an on-campus world of fear and deceit and murder.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=78cwmsHE_kwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Invasion of Iraq","description":"\\"This book contributes significantly ot the conversation seeking to understand the international forces at play in the threatening war on Iraq.\\"  Nelson Mandela \\"Behind the Invasion of Iraq . . .synthesizes the seemingly disparate threads of the U.S. war drive in a blistering indictment of American foreign policy . . .The effect is of puzzle pieces clicking into place.\\"  Counterpunch Since September 11, 2001, there have been many accounts of the ways in which the alignment of global power is changing or will be changed by the U.S.'s \\"war on terrorism.\\" Most of them take as their starting point the options facing the wealthy and powerful nations of the world seeking to control an ever larger share of the world's resources. Behind the Invasion of Iraq is written from a different perspective, and one that makes possible a far more comprehensive point of view. Its authors, Research Unit for Political Economy, are rooted in the politics of a Third World country India which has long been on the receiving end of imperialist power. As a consequence, they have a more sober view of the workings of global power. In clear and accessible prose, weighing the evidence carefully and tracing events to their root causes, they move beyond moral outrage to a clear view of the process being set in motion by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. They show that the invasion of Iraq is a desperate gamble by a section of the U.S. ruling elite to preserve their power, driven by the wish to stave off economic crisis through military means. Their efforts will not end with Iraq, but will require the recolonization of the middle East. Behind the Invasion of Iraq exposes the idea that war will bring democracy to the Middle East as so much propaganda. In a context where so many rulers are themselves clients of the United States, the war is aimed not at the rulers but at the masses of ordinary people whose hostility to imperialism has not been broken even by corrupt and autocratic rulers. This book describes the remaking of global power with a truly global awareness of what is at stake.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PqxX5eidvn8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ingls esencial","description":"Created for the serious language-learner, this deluxe course has been revisedand updated.

It achieved truly canonical preeminence when it became one of the Four Books compiled and annotated by the Southern Song dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi (1130-1200). Within the compass of world literature, the influence of these books (Analects of Confucius, Great Learning, Zhongyong, and Mencius) on the Sinitic world of East Asia has been no less than the Bible and the Qu'ran on Western civilization. With this new translation David Hall and Roger Ames provide a distinctly philosophical interpretation of the Zhongyong, remaining attentive to the semantic and conceptual nuances of the text to account for its central place within classical Chinese literature. They present the text in such a way as to provide Western philosophers and other intellectuals access to a set of interpretations and arguments that offer new insights into issues and concerns common to both Chinese and Western thinkers. In addition to the annotated translation, a glossary of terms gives in concise form important senses of the terms that play a key role in the argument of the Zhongyong. An appendix addresses some of the more technical issues relevant to the understanding of both the history of the text and the history of its English translations. Here the translators introduce readers to the best contemporary textual studies of the Zhongyong and make use of the most recent archaeological discoveries in China to place the work within its own intellectual context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=75wBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hebrew-English Concordance to the Old Testament","description":"Here is the most complete concordance showing the relationships of Hebrew words to the NIV.

He was the first to use the term \\"Renaissance\\" (rinascita) in print, though an awareness of the ongoing \\"rebirth\\" in the arts had been in the air since the time of Alberti, and he was responsible for our use of the term Gothic Art, though he only used the word Goth which he associated with the \\"barbaric\\" German style. The Lives also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. The book was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural). The work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of Florentines, and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art   for example, the invention of engraving. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including Titian) it did so without achieving a neutral point of view. Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a painting by Cimabue that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. With a few exceptions, however, Vasari's aesthetic judgement was acute and unbiased. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism  with new materials opened up by research  has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. Vasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of the Lives, and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati. According to the historian Richard Goldthwaite, Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term \\"competition\\" (or \\"concorrenza\\" in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of Pietro Perugino, in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so. Competition, he said, is \\"one of the nourishments that maintain them.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pk8gCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breaking Trail","description":"The personal story of the first American woman climber to attempt Mount Everest describes her transformation from an overprotected Chicago youth to the leader of women climbing teams, describing her successful ascents of Mount McKinley and Annapurna and her receipt of a Gold Medal from the Society of Women Geographers.

La Vanguardia Yambo es un hombre de sesenta a?os que, tras sufrir un accidente, ha perdido la memoria personal, la m?s ligada a las emociones, y ve su propia vida como si acabara de inaugurarla. Para recuperarse, pasa una temporada en el caser?n de Solara, un pueblo en las colinas piamontesas, donde pas? su infancia. En el desv?n est?n guardados los libros, los c?mics, los discos, los recortes de peri?dico y los carteles de las pel?culas que lo acompa?aron en los primeros a?os de su vida. Yambo inicia entonces una labor casi detectivesca por volver a dibujar el pasado a trav?s de estos objetos, cosas nuevas que le hablan de un mundo que fue el suyo y el de todas las personas que vivieron los momentos m?s importantes del siglo xx. ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Yambo, a sixtyish rare-book dealer who lives in Milan, has suffered a loss of memory-he can remember the plot of every book he has ever read, every line of poetry, but he no longer knows his own name, doesn't recognize his wife or his daughters, and remembers nothing about his parents or his childhood. In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin. There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love. A fascinating, abundant new novel-wide-ranging, nostalgic, funny, full of heart-from the incomparable Eco.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FffKAQAACAAJ&dq=La+Misteriosa+Llama+De+La+Reina+Loana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialectic and Dialogue: Plato's Practice of Philosophical Inquiry (Northwestern University SPEP Studies in Historical Philosophy (paperback))","description":"Dialectic and Dialogue seeks to define the method and the aims of Plato's dialectic in both the \\"inconclusive\\" dialogues and the dialogues that describe and practice a method of hypothesis.

The Ship of the Law travels the infinite enormity of space, carrying eighty-two young people: fighters, strategists, scientists and children. After one alien culture destroyed their home, another offered the opportunity for revenge in the form of a starship built from fragments of the Earth s corpse, a ship they now use to scour the universe in search of their enemy. Working with sophisticated nonhuman technologies that need new thinking to comprehend them, they re cut off forever from the people they left behind. Denied information, they live within a complex system that is both obedient and beyond their control. They re frightened. And they re waging war against entities whose technologies are unimaginably advanced and vast, and whose psychology is ultimately, unknowably alien.

Poems for the Millennium captures the essence of that change, and unlike any anthology available today it reveals the revolutionary concepts at the very heart of contemporary poetry. International in its coverage, these volumes bring together the poets and poetry movements that radically altered the ways that art and language express the human condition. Volume 2 offers a dazzling chronicle of the second \\"great awakening\\" of experimental poetry in the twentieth century. Ranging from the period of World War II through the cold war to the onset of the twenty-first century, this volume presents two \\"galleries\\" of individual poets such as Holan, Olson, Rukeyser, Jab s, Celan, Mac Low, Pasolini, Bachmann, Finlay, Ginsberg, Adonis, Rich, U Tam'si, Baraka, Takahashi, Waldman, and Bei Dao. There are also samplings of local and international movements: the Beats, the Vienna Group, the Cobra poets and artists, the Arabic-language Tammuzi poets, the creators of a new \\"Concrete Poetry,\\" the \\"postwar poets\\" of Japan, the Italian Novissimi and Avan-Guardia, the Chinese Misty Poets, and the North American Language Poets. In addition, an extended section is devoted to examples of the \\"art of the manifesto\\" and two smaller groupings of traditional \\"oral poets\\" and of experimenters with machine art and cyberpoetics. Poet-editors Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris provide informative and irreverent commentaries throughout. They challenge old truths and propose alternative directions, in the tradition of the manifestos that have marked the art and poetry of the twentieth century.

It was here that Gerald Hanley spent the Second World War, charged with preventing bloodshed between feuding tribes at a remote out-station. Rations were scarce, pay infrequent and his detachment of native soldiers near-mutinous. In these extreme conditions seven British officers committed suicide, but Hanley describes the period as the 'most valuable time' of his life. With intense curiosity and open-mindedness, he explores the effects of loneliness. He comes to understand the Somalis' love of fighting and to admire their contempt for death. 'Of all the races of Africa,' he says, 'there cannot be one better to live among than the most difficult, the proudest, the bravest, the vainest, the most merciless, the friendliest: the Somalis.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Og8OAQAAMAAJ&dq=Warriors:+Life+and+Death+Among+the+Somalis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brian Lumley Companion, The","description":"Edited by Brian Lumley and multiple Bram Stoker Award winner Stanley Wiater, The Brian Lumley Companion is an indispensable guide to the life and works of Brian Lumley.

He focuses on Athens where the Protogeometric and Geometric styles first appeared. He considers pot shape and painted decoration primarily in relation to the other relevant features - metal artefacts, grave architecture, funerary rites, and the age and sex of the deceased - and also takes into account different contexts in which these shapes and decorations appear. A computer analysis of grave assemblages supports his view that pot style is an integral part of the collective representations of Early Athenian society. It is a lens through which we can focus on the changing social circumstances of Dark Age Greece. Dr Whitley's approach to the study of style challenges many of the assumptions which have underpinned more traditional studies of Early Greek art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RAKJ-1ISCGQC&dq=Style+and+Society+in+Dark+Age+Greece:+The+Changing+Face+of+a+Pre-literate+Society,+1100-700+BC+(New+Studies+in+Archaeology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ax or Ask?

But from seminary and their early years in ministry to their golden years looking back on what it takes to lead a congregation, a stimulating, sometimes puzzling, yet often inspirational world of theological controversies and congregational concerns would unfold for these two men of God. A Church Wide Enough for Everyone follows these two men on their journey to demonstrate the continuing relevance of the Christian faith in a postmodern world. After moving to Berkeley, California, to attend college and seminary, they have little time to ponder the vast social changes taking place before they immediately enter into intensive critical study of the Bible and Christian theology. And as Robert is then thrust into the ordained ministry with his wife, Faye, both men must in their own ways face the political, cultural, and ideological pressures of each passing decade, responding to challenges from both within the church and from outsiders. Are mainline churchesand Christian theologydead? Or might they be revitalized in the current century? A Church Wide Enough for Everyone and the inspired journeys of two ministers offers a window into how this revitalization and new understanding is possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YapLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago O'Hare: The World's Busiest Airport","description":"A pictorial review of the aircraft - primarily commercial airliners - that currently operate at Chicago O'Hare airport.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5VAmQAAACAAJ&dq=Chicago+O%27Hare:+The+World%27s+Busiest+Airport&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Craft of Musical Composition: Book 2 (Stap/067)","description":"\\"In contrast to many musical textbooks written by academic musicians, these were produced by a man who could play every instrument of the orchestra, could compose a satisfying piece for almost every kind of ensemble, and who was one of the most stimulating teachers of his day.

The new Soviet government arrested priests, closed church buildings, exposed fraudulent monastic relics, forbade the printing of religious literature, and denied religious education to the young-all the while proclaiming abroad that there was no religious persecution in Russia. They set out to crush not only all organized religion but even the likelihood of religious thought.And God Created Lenin examines in depth the conflict between Lenin's logic-driven efforts to stamp out religion and the churches' passionate attempts to save themselves from obliteration. It looks at both sides objectively and admits that they both presented strong cases. In this thoroughly researched yet accessible study, historian Paul Gabel offers a new understanding of the only effort in world history to upset the universality of religion.Besides the main conflict between the Russian Orthodox Church and the atheist state, Gabel also considers the tensions that this campaign against religion caused within the Communist Party. In addition, he discusses the bitter hatred dividing the Orthodox factions that refused cooperation with the government from those that tried to adapt the church to communism.Was the failure of Soviet communism to eradicate religion simply a matter of practical miscalculation, or was this effort, in light of the persistence of religion throughout history, ultimately unrealistic and doomed from the start? This is the key question that Gabel's fascinating, insightful narrative attempts to answer.Paul Gabel (Scotts Valley, CA), trained as a historian at the University of California at Berkeley, is a retired educator and the creator of the educational software The Vietnam War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oj8gV2vzVtAC&dq=And+God+Created+Lenin:+Marxism+vs+Religion+In+Russia,+1917-1929&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twelve Against the Gods: the Story of Adventure","description":"An instant bestseller when first published in 1929 biographies of twelve bold individuals from history and what they did to separate themselves from the pack.

Bolitho elucidates both the struggles and successes that made these figures so iconic, and demonstrates how they all battled convention and conformity to achieve enduring fame and notoriety.  We are born adventurers,  Bolitho writes,  and the love of adventures never leaves us till we are very old; old, timid men, in whose interest it is that adventure should quite die out. This is why all the poets are on one side, and all the laws on the other; for laws are made by, and usually for, old men.

It is the first time a novelist has ever described that distant world in words that open it up to Western readers in the clearest, most vivid terms. Shanghai, 1949: we look through the eyes of Guan Ling-ling, a headstrong, idealistic seventeen-year-old. As her family departs for Hong Kong, Ling-ling boldly chooses to stay, and joins a revolutionary theater group which soon leaves the city to carry out the new reforms in the Chinese countryside. After a scant few weeks  preparation, this city-bred schoolgirl suddenly finds herself in one of China s most remote and impoverished areas, a world so far from her own experience that she can barely understand the lives she has been sent to change. On her very first night in Longxiang ( the Dragon s Village ), a dusty hamlet far in the northwest, Ling-ling s life is threatened by agents of a defiant landlord. From that moment on , an unrelenting flood of events engulfs her: plot and counterplot, acts of violence, midnight raids, dramatic personal revelations, even glimmers of first love, all set against a canvas of revolutionary upheaval. Chen carries us on an incredible voyage against China at a critical moment in modern history. No novelist has focused so clearly or so closely on the faces of revolution, or on the physical and social landscapes in which it was played out, from the urbane circles of Shanghai to the parched fields and desolate families in tiny Longxiang. We are wholly involved in Ling-ling s struggle to assume the unfamiliar garb of soldier and teacher, and can recognize in it an adolescent s painful path to maturity. Yuan-tsung Chen was born in Shanghai and educated in a missionary school for girls there. She has just graduated from high school in 1949, and soon went to work at the Film Bureau in Peking. In 1951, she joined she joined land reform workers in Gansu Province, the setting of this, her first book. It was the first of several agrarian campaigns in which she took part over the next twenty years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qw2nItgArhgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highlander(TM): Zealot (Highlander (Warner))","description":"Duncan MacLeod, member of an age-old race of immortal beings, is in Paris helping a friend organize a museum exhibit of ancient cultures destroyed by the Romans.

Under the dhimmi religious caste system, non-Muslims were subjected to legal and financial oppression, as well as social isolation.

Virginia Woolf's third novel Jacob's Room is a character study that ponders how well any person can be known.

It was a story that generations of Americans have also come to know through Dorothea Lange's unforgettable photos of migrant families struggling to make a living in Depression-torn California. Now in James N. Gregory's pathbreaking American Exodus, there is at last an historical study that moves beyond the fiction and the photographs to uncover the full meaning of these events. American Exodus takes us back to the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and the war boom influx of the 1940s to explore the experiences of the more than one million Oklahomans, Arkansans, Texans, and Missourians who sought opportunities in California. Gregory reaches into the migrants' lives to reveal not only their economic trials but also their impact on California's culture and society. He traces the development of an \\"Okie subculture\\" that over the years has grown into an essential element in California's cultural landscape. The consequences, however, reach far beyond California. The Dust Bowl migration was part of a larger heartland diaspora that has sent millions of Southerners and rural Midwesterners to the nation's northern and western industrial perimeter. American Exodus is the first book to examine the cultural implications of that massive 20th-century population shift. In this rich account of the experiences and impact of these migrant heartlanders, Gregory fills an important gap in recent American social history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qNdtGwnXYrIC&dq=American+Exodus:+The+Dust+Bowl+Migration+and+Okie+Culture+in+California&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Einstein's Universe","description":"A Princeton astrophysicist explores whether journeying to the past or future is scientifically possible in this  intriguing  volume (Neil deGrasse Tyson). It was H. G. Wells who coined the term  time machine  but the concept of time travel, both forward and backward, has always provoked fascination and yearning. It has mostly been dismissed as an impossibility in the world of physics; yet theories posited by Einstein, and advanced by scientists including Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, suggest that the phenomenon could actually occur. Building on these ideas, J. Richard Gott, a professor who has written on the subject for Scientific American, Time, and other publications, describes how travel to the future is not only possible but has already happened and contemplates whether travel to the past is also conceivable. This look at the surprising facts behind the science fiction of time travel  deserves the attention of anyone wanting wider intellectual horizons  (Booklist).  Impressively clear language. Practical tips for chrononauts on their options for travel and the contingencies to prepare for make everything sound bizarrely plausible. Gott clearly enjoys his subject and his excitement and humor are contagious; this book is a delight to read.

Here, set against the backdrop of America struggling through the Depression, is the world of magic, a realm of stars, sleight of hand, and sin where dreams could be realized - or stolen away. Following the Crash of '29, Dai Vernon, known by magicians as \\"the man who fooled Houdini,\\" is tramping down Midwestern backroads, barely making ends meet. While swapping secrets with a Mexican gambler, he hears of a guy he doesn't quite believe is real - a legendary mystery man who deals perfectly from the center of the deck and who locals call the greatest cardsharp of all time. Determined to find the reclusive genius, Vernon sets out on a journey through America's shady, slick, and sinful side - from mob-run Kansas City through railroad towns that looked sleepy only in the daytime. Does he find the sharp? Well, Karl Johnson did - after years of research into Vernon's colorful quest, research that led him to places he never knew existed. Johnson takes us to the cardsharp's doorstep and shows us how he bestowed on Vernon the greatest secret in magic. The Magician and the Cardsharp is a unique and endlessly entertaining piece of history that reveals the artistry and obsession of a special breed of American showmen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dk_h0HhStvIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grass-Widow's Tale","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ytJqtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Grass-Widow%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Opera Lover's Companion","description":"Written by a well-known authority, this book consists of 175 entries that set some of the most popular operas within the context of their composer's career, outline the plot, discuss the music, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x1o-iElHqZkC&dq=The+Opera+Lover%27s+Companion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The prayers of Kierkegaard (Midway reprint)","description":"Soren Kierkegaard's influence has been felt in many areas of human thought from theology to psychology.

Yet in the often acrimonious debates between the scientific and religions communities, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that both science and religion are systems of thought and knowledge that aim to understand the world and our place in it. Webs of Reality is a rare examination of the interrelationship between religion and science from a social science perspective, offering a broader view of the relationship, and posing practical questions regarding technology and ethics. Emphasizing how science and religion are practiced instead of highlighting the differences between them, the authors look for the subtle connections, tacit understandings, common history, symbols, and implicit myths that tie them together. How can the practice of science be understood from a religious point of view? What contributions can science make to religious understanding of the world? What contributions can the social sciences make to understanding both knowledge systems? Looking at religion and science as fields of inquiry and habits of mind, the authors discover not only similarities between them but also a wide number of ways in which they complement each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GY6i84rSKMcC&dq=Webs+of+Reality:+Social+Perspectives+on+Science+and+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic: Stage illusions and scientific diversions, including trick photography","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jFROAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fun at the Beach ( a Whitman Tiny - Tot Tale )","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rnd2HAAACAAJ&dq=Fun+at+the+Beach+(+a+Whitman+Tiny+-+Tot+Tale+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Guide to Crisis and Trauma Counseling","description":"Many pastors and lay counselors have had minimal training in clinical methods of grief and trauma counseling.

With the English King Edward heirless and ailing, across the grey seas in Normandy the brutal William the Bastard waits for the moment when he can drown England in a tide of blood. The ravens of war are gathering. But as the king's closest advisors scheme and squabble amongst themselves, hopes of resisting the naked ambition of the Norman duke come to rest with just one man: Hereward. To some a ruthless warrior and master tactician, to others a devil in human form, Hereward is as adept in the art of warfare as the foes that gather to claim England's throne. But in his country's hour of greatest need, his enemies at court have made him an outlaw. To stay alive and a free man he must carve a bloody swathe from the frozen lands outside the court, in this evocative tale of a man whose deeds will become the stuff of legend.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MKVFEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware, Or, Illumination","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BtlnGYGTzVAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Worlds Vast and Various: Stories","description":"The sisters of the Order of Saint Rita captain their living ship into the reaches of space in Lina Rather's debut novella, Sisters of the Vast Black.

He adds: \\"Seen from sufficient distance, this is a small topic.\\" Sterling offers a brilliant, often hilarious history of shaped things. We have moved from an age of artifacts, made by hand, through complex machines, to the current era of \\"gizmos.\\" New forms of design and manufacture are appearing that lack historical precedent, he writes; but the production methods, using archaic forms of energy and materials that are finite and toxic, are not sustainable. The future will see a new kind of object; we have the primitive forms of them now in our pockets and briefcases: user-alterable, baroquely multi-featured, and programmable, that will be sustainable, enhanceable, and uniquely identifiable. Sterling coins the term \\"spime\\" for them, these future-manufactured objects with informational support so extensive and rich that they are regarded as material instantiations of an immaterial system. Spimes are designed on screens, fabricated by digital means, and precisely tracked through space and time. They are made of substances that can be folded back into the production stream of future spimes, challenging all of us to become involved in their production. Spimes are coming, says Sterling. We will need these objects in order to live; we won't be able to surrender their advantages without awful consequences. The vision of Shaping Things is given material form by the intricate design of Lorraine Wild. Shaping Things is for designers and thinkers, engineers and scientists, entrepreneurs and financiers; and anyone who wants to understand and be part of the process of technosocial transformation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cr9NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Shaping+Things+(Mediaworks+Pamphlets)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arcade (Star Trek Deep Space Nine)","description":"Participating in a virtual-reality game called The Zhondran Crystal Quest, Jake and Nog learn that their success is pivotal to a lucrative Ferengi-Zhondran business deal and find themselves pitted against an all-too-real Borg.

The original book, published in 1962, has remained one of the most celebrated World War II stories for more than four decades. The Big E participated in nearly every major engagement of the war against Japan and earned a total of twenty battle stars.

This superb study of a great ship, her crew, and the action they saw has been called one of the finest pieces of naval writing to emerge from the war. Author Edward Stafford mined genuine nuggets from the mountain of research and lengthy interviews he conducted to write this book. He answers questions such as: What was it like to be inside the cockpit of a Dauntless dive bomber as it bored in on its target or what kind effort was required to unstick the ship's huge rudder when it was damaged by a bomb?

And yet, tourism also creates jobs, encourages infrastructure development, and in many places inspires the only possibility of hope and well-being. Stuck with Tourism explores the ambivalent nature of tourism by drawing on ethnographic evidence from the Mexican Yucat n Peninsula, a region voraciously transformed by tourism development over the past forty years. Contrasting labor and lived experiences at the beach resorts of Canc n, protected natural enclaves along the Gulf coast, historical buildings of the colonial past, and maquilas for souvenir production in the Maya heartland, this book explores the moral, political, ecological, and everyday dilemmas that emerge when, as Yucat n s inhabitants put it, people get stuck in tourism s grip.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wer2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forest Entomology: Ecology and Management","description":"This text considers forest insects occurring in forest ecosystems, specialized forestry settings, and urban forests, with an approach and coverage that make it suitable for use in both undergraduate and graduate courses in forest entomology and forest protection.

The circus unfolds, spinning magical, dark strands that ensnare the town s populace: the sea serpent s tale shatters love s illusions; the fortune-teller s shocking pronouncements toll the tedium and secret dread of every person s life; sensual undercurrents pour forth for men and women alike; and the dead walk again.

The selections of Handel?s music included here are those best understood and most apt to be mastered by young musicians. One evening, back in 1691, conservative Doctor Handel was shocked and dismayed to find his small son carrying the torch at the head of a band of singers wandering through the little town of Halle. The good doctor never quite understood the all-consuming love of music which drove his son from childhood on and on to the great heights he eventually attained as the beloved Father of the Oratorio, the composer of the magnificent MESSIAH. Opal Wheeler has given us here the most finished, most completely satisfying book on her list of fine music biographies. Handel at the Court of Kings should be a favorite of all children who love music, whether they are young musicians themselves or not.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pN47AQAACAAJ&dq=Handel+at+the+court+of+kings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guppies for Tea","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Road Map to the Future","description":"In this study, the committee explores ways the National Weather Service (NWS) can take advantage of continuing advances in science and technology to meet the challenges of the future.

Author of some 200 pieces of fiction that have been compared to the works of Poe, Kipling, and Jack London, Quiroga experienced a life that surpassed in morbidity and horror many of the inventions of his fevered mind. As a young man, he suffered his father's accidental death and the suicide of his beloved stepfather. As a teenager, he shot and accidentally killed one of his closest friends. Seemingly cursed in love, he lost his first wife to suicide by poison. In the end, Quiroga himself downed cyanide to end his own life when he learned he was suffering from an incurable cancer. In life Quiroga was obsessed with death, a legacy of the violence he had experienced. His stories are infused with death, too, but they span a wide range of short fiction genres: jungle tale, Gothic horror story, morality tale, psychological study. Many of his stories are set in the steaming jungle of the Misiones district of northern Argentina, where he spent much of his life, but his tales possess a universality that elevates them far above the work of a regional writer. The first representative collection of his work in English, The Decapitated Chicken and Other Stories provides a valuable overview of the scope of Quiroga's fiction and the versatility and skill that have made him a classic Latin American writer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rYWyRufNC6oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Kirkpatrick genealogy: Being an account of the descendants of the family of James Kirkpatrick of South Carolina, ca. 1715-1786","description":"James Kirkpatrick was born between 1700 and 1715, probably in North Ireland or Pennsylvania.

In other words, I don't have to just think about whatever falls into my mind. This was a life-changing revelation for me because as Proverbs 23:7 says, \\" As he [a man] thinks in his heart, so is he\\". I like to say it like this: Where the mind goes, the man follows. Now God is concerned about the hidden man of the heart, which is our inner life. Our inner life is what we think about. And like the scripture above says, the way we think determines how we live and who we are. That's why we need to think about what we're thinking about. It's so important for us to understand this because if we don't learn how to take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ (see 2 Corinthians 10:4-5 ), we won't live the life Jesus died to give us  a life of peace with God, peace with ourselves, great relationships, real joy and the ability to become all God has created us to be.

However, instead of serving just as an account of Adams  deeds, The Education of Henry Adams is a series of observations and introspections Adams makes on social changes, scientific advancements, personal relationships, professional success, travel, religion, war, and education. Born into the privilege of wealth and the renowned success of his ancestors, President John Adams and President John Quincy Adams, Adams received an education from notable schools, such as Harvard. He continued his prestigious education in Berlin, studying law and the German language. Despite his formal education, Adams felt unprepared to face the changing dynamics of his country, including shifts in social, religious, political, and scientific beliefs. For this reason, Adams advocates for  self-education  through experience, friendships, and reading. In his autobiography, Adams endorses studying American history and science in school, and encourages the process of self-educating after one s formal education. With a set of strong political and religious beliefs, Adams invokes a substantial impression with his perspectives on the on-going transformation of the United States of America. Henry Adams  autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams, has earned remarkable acclaim, including receiving a Pulitzer Prize. As a man who had direct access to many American political offices, including the presidential cabinet, the senate, and the congress, Adams had an intimate view of the innerworkings of American politics, and lived through social changes such as the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, scientific advancements, shifts in religious views, and the first World War. Though he felt his formal education left him unprepared for such happenings, Adams encourages readers to learn from their experiences and relationships. The Education of Henry Adams offers invaluable insight on the rapid changes in society, and reminds readers that one s education is never finished. Now with a new, eye-catching cover design and reprinted in a modern font, The Education of Henry Adams by Henry Adams is more accessible than ever and able to offer modern-day readers insight on historical events and philosophy of learning that will always be relevant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nPIIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight men out; the Black Sox and the 1919 world series","description":"The headlines proclaimed the 1919 fix of the World Series and attempted cover-up as \\"the most gigantic sporting swindle in the history of America!\\" First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c7Z0oEl3Y_MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colombia secreta","description":"Secret beaches, hidden lakes, unknown craters, unmarked rivers, and cryptic messages are revealed in this guide to Colombia's most remote and secret places.

TV s Supernanny regularly captures kids wildly, unbelievably out of control. How did our families get to such a state? Child psychologist Dr. Beth Grosshans has the answer. And mothers and fathers everywhere are listening. In what is sure to become a much-discussed blockbuster, Dr. Grosshans reveals why she believes nearly a half-century of parenting advice--with its emphasis on talking, exalting children s self-esteem, and time-outs--is largely to blame for today s lack of discipline. Her innovative ideas and techniques challenge this prevailing culture, proving that power and authority are as essential as love and good intentions to effective parenting. She persuasively explains why kids can only grow up healthy and strong when firmly led by their parents  experience and better judgment, and provides a clear, easy five step program to follow. She enables parents to look at themselves clearly and identify their child-rearing style; they are often shocked to discover how their own behavior has inadvertently caused an imbalance in the family s structure. Reading Beyond Time-Out is akin to sitting with Dr. Grosshans in her clinical office--and her core truths about healthy parent-child relationships are timeless.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VzwJlMASJ6QC&dq=Time+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revenge of the Damned","description":"Sten had fully expected to die in a blaze of glory, taking his Emperor's greatest foe with him.

Post-Zionism - anti-Zionism - is the continuation of Jews' objections that emerged alongside Zionism to the rejuvenation of their historic civilization. This book examines the dimensions and implications of the anti-Zionists' struggle against Israel as a Jewish nation. In a strong and documented rebuttal of post-Zionist claims, Zionism's vitality is shown to be pivotal in contemporary debates about Jewry's national and cultural existence, and the future direction of the Israeli state. The continuous debate in Israel about its identity has turned into a dispute over the state's source of authority and society's ethos: who are the composers; what are its values and symbols; and who are the elite who will lead it. Political elections have not resolved these issues. While ideological differences still separate political adversaries and divide political groups from within, post-Zionist practices and outlooks are common to both sides of the political divide. The media sketch these controversies as ideological, but the essence of post-Zionism encompasses a range of values increasingly shared by wider circles of Israeli society. The twelve contributors, well-known Israeli and American scholars, address all aspects of the post-Zionist debate, including: the state's jurisdiction in religious matters; international public opinion and international law in conflict with Israel's national interest; and the relationship between opponents of Jewish national renewal and Arab resistance. This book is published in association with The Ariel Center for Policy Research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aoBtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Israel+and+the+Post-Zionists:+A+Nation+at+Risk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friedrich Schiller: Crime, Aesthetics, And The Poetics Of Punishment","description":"This study traces Schiller's admiration for aberrants to his own \\"incarceration\\" in Duke Carl Eugen of Wurttemberg's highly regulated Hohe Karlsschule. Schiller's escape, the illicit flight that followed the criminalization of his writing, culminated in the programmatic \\"Die Schaubuhne als moralische Anstalt betrachtet\\" (The Dramatic Stage as a Moral Institution), in which he opposes the stage to the absolutist state as a viable and preferable counter-regime. Subsequent chapters follow the progress of Schiller's aspirations to Wirkung, or theatrical/pedagogical efficacy, as beneficial impulse and coercive force in his aesthetic confrontations with crime and its consequences. A final chapter addresses Schillerian intertextuality in the twentieth century, and the survival of Schillerian ideals of freedom and aesthetic education in modern mutations.

Legal historian James Oldham assembles a mix of his signature essays and new work on the history of jury trial, tracing how trial by jury was transplanted to America and preserved in the Constitution. Trial by Jury begins with a rigorous examination of English civil jury practices in the late eighteenth century, including how judges determined one's right to trial by jury and who composed the jury. Oldham then considers the extensive historical use of a variety of  special juries,  such as juries of merchants for commercial cases and juries of women for claims of pregnancy. Special juries were used for centuries in both English and American law, although they are now considered antithetical to the idea that American juries should be drawn from jury pools that reflect reasonable cross-sections of their communities. An introductory overview addresses the relevance of Anglo-American legal tradition and history in understanding America's modern jury system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F-u24xKc3W0C&dq=Trial+by+Jury+(The+Operas,+No.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Troubled Midnight","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tAwFAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Troubled+Midnight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cranberry Easter","description":"Events at Easter time convince Seth, owner of Cranberryport's general store, that he is needed in town and should change his plans to retire and leave.

Refuting the popular portrayal of Roosevelt as a vacillating, impulsive man who displayed no organizational skills in his decision-making during this period, Heinrichs presents him as a leader who acted with extreme caution and deliberation, who always kept his options open, and who, once Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union stalled in July, 1941, acted rapidly and with great determination. This masterful account of a key moment in American history captures the tension faced by Roosevelt, Churchill, Stimson, Hull, and numerous others as they struggled to shape American policy in the climactic nine months before Pearl Harbor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VnJLAv7tSwMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crazy (German Edition)","description":"Those Crazy Germans! gives you the inside scoop on the people and the culture so you can get the most out of your trip to Germany.

Does his famous painting, The Last Supper, contain a hidden code about this society's most precious secret? Did Jesus father children by Mary Magdalene? What was the Holy Grail?The best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown has stirred the popular imagination by cleverly interweaving theories about such questions with a fast-paced fictional narrative. Many readers have been so swept away by the drama of this murder mystery that they have accepted Brown's fictional reconstruction of Christian origins and medieval history as established fact.New Testament scholar Robert M. Price, a member of the Jesus Seminar, examines the creative uses of history in Brown's novel, showing that, however intriguing Brown's fictional speculations may be, the real facts behind the novel are even more fascinating.What does the best historical evidence say about the possibility that Jesus might have survived the crucifixion? How did the Gospels come to be accepted as the established accounts of Jesus' life and why were other Gnostic traditions suppressed? How did the Roman Emperor Constantine figure in the development of Christian dogma? What was Mary Magdalene's role in early Christianity and how was it adapted in later attempts to develop a sacred feminine element in Christianity? These are some of the important questions about Christianity that Dr. Price pursues in this engrossing discussion of Christian history.Price combines sophisticated historical analysis with completely accessible and witty prose in this enlightening, factually based analysis of Brown's speculative bestseller.Robert M. Price (Selma, NC) is the editor (with Jeffery Jay Lowder) of The Empty Tomb: Jesus Beyond the Grave and The Journal of Higher Criticism. He is also the author of The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man: How Reliable Is the Gospel Tradition?, Deconstructing Jesus, The Widow Traditions in Luke-Acts, and Beyond Born Again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AaotKqeuYrsC&dq=Vermeer%27s+Riddle+Revealed:+The+Sphinx,+the+Jester,+and+the+Grail+Geometry:+Robert+A.+diCurcio%27s+Analysis+of+Vermeer%27s+Pictorial+Compositions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Florida wild flowers;: An introduction to the Florida flora,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=btONMAEACAAJ&dq=Florida+wild+flowers%3B:+An+introduction+to+the+Florida+flora,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CALLAGHEN","description":"The classic Western, now newly repackaged as part of Bantam's Louis L'Amour's Lost Treasures program--with never-before-seen bonus material from Louis and his son, Beau L'Amour.

The German parachutists soon outnumbered the British troops who were forced first to retreat, then to evacuate, before Crete fell to the Germans. So began the Cretan Resistance and the young shepherd s career as a wartime runner. In this unique account of the Resistance, Psychoundakis records the daily life of his fellow Cretans, his treacherous journeys on foot from the eastern White Mountains to the western slopes of Mount Ida to transmit messages and transport goods, and his enduring friendships with British officers (like his eventual translator Patrick Leigh Fermor) whose missions he helped to carry out with unflagging courage, energy, and good humor.

The New Woman of the 1920s puffed cigarettes, snuck gin, hiked her hemlines, danced the Charleston, and necked in roadsters. More important, she earned her own keep, controlled her own destiny, and secured liberties that modern women take for granted. Flapper is an inside look at the 1920s. With tales of Coco Chanel, the French orphan who redefined the feminine form; Lois Long, the woman who christened herself  Lipstick  and gave New Yorker readers a thrilling entr e into Manhattan s extravagant Jazz Age nightlife; three of America s first celebrities: Clara Bow, Colleen Moore, and Louise Brooks; Dallas-born fashion artist Gordon Conway; Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, whose swift ascent and spectacular fall embodied the glamour and excess of the era; and more, this is the story of America s first sexual revolution, its first merchants of cool, its first celebrities, and its most sparkling advertisement for the right to pursue happiness. Whisking us from the Alabama country club where Zelda Sayre first caught the eye of F. Scott Fitzgerald to Muncie, Indiana, where would-be flappers begged their mothers for silk stockings, to the Manhattan speakeasies where patrons partied till daybreak, historian Joshua Zeitz brings the 1920s to exhilarating life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TIiL9OVQXhEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HOUSE OF THE DEER","description":"At short notice Gerald Burleigh Brown is asked to take a deer-stalking holiday in Scotland in place of his brother-in-law.

It is a melodramatic tragedy set in Russia and is loosely based on the life of Vera Zasulich. It was Wilde's first play, and the first to be performed. In 1880, with only a few copies privately printed, arrangements were made with noted actresses for a production in the United Kingdom, but this never materialized. The first public performance was in New York City in 1883 at the Union Square Theatre, based on revisions made by Wilde while lecturing in America in 1882. The play was not a success and folded after only one week. It is rarely revived. Prologue Vera is a barmaid in her father's tavern, which is situated along a road to the prison camps in Siberia. A gang of prisoners stop at the tavern. Vera immediately recognises her brother Dmitri as one of the prisoners. He begs her to go to Moscow and join the Nihilists, a terrorist group trying to assassinate the Czar, and avenge his imprisonment. She and her father's manservant Michael leave to join the Nihilists. Act I Five years later, Vera has become the Nihilists' top assassin, and is wanted across Europe. She is in love with a fellow Nihilist named Alexis: however, Nihilists are sworn never to marry. A Nihilist meeting is nearly broken up by soldiers, but Alexis thwarts the soldiers by revealing his true identity: he is the Tsarevich, heir to the Russian throne. This act earns him the further admiration of Vera and the hatred of the Nihilists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=avqNyQEACAAJ&dq=Vera+Or+The+Nihilists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Joy = Two Sorrows","description":"Three themes bind this collection of eight stories: women, around whom the stories are built, Goa, in which the stories are set, and the popular rhyme, One for sorrow, two for joy, which is used as an anchor; each story, in turn, reflecting the emotions or objects referred to in successive lines of the rhyme. Sorrow and joy, girls and boys, silver and gold, secrets, food, drink, wishes, kisses and messages - these are the stuff that stories have been made of since they were told at the dawn of humankind in huddles around campfires. And this is the stuff these stories are also made of. Though authentically Goan, these tales speak universally to all.

On a Friday afternoon, March 24, 2001, he succumbed to a sudden attack of spring fever and cut his classes for a stroll in a public park near the campus. Even after fifty years and several hundred centuries, he remembered it as vividly as though it had happened an hour before. It was a warm, fresh day with a promise of spring--the first really pleasant day of the year after the usual vagaries of a midwest winter. He strolled leisurely through the park, thinking with shameless delight of the stuffy classrooms he was avoiding. Eventually he seated himself on a patch of greening grass with a convenient tree to lean against and enjoyed the soft breeze and the peaceful surroundings while he absently whittled on a twig he had picked up. He felt sleepy. Probably he dozed off. Then came a tremendous jerk, like having a chair pulled from under him at the same instant that a truck hit him, and he almost lost consciousness. He landed with a painful bump and skidded for a short distance along a very rough wood floor. For a moment he sat gazing about him dazedly. He had been abruptly translated from his seat on the ground in a pleasant park on a lovely spring day to a seat on a wood floor in a large, dim room with a thunderstorm raging outside. He had a distinct impression that the two scenes had been linked by an earthquake. He tried hard to focus his thoughts, staring first at a table where a candle burned brightly and then at an animal tied to one of the table's legs by a short leash. It was a hairy pig. He raised his eyes to the room's two small, water-streaked windows and saw nothing beyond but branches swaying in a strong wind...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OW70AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Elliott Wave Writings of A.J. Frost and Richard Russell","description":"A. J. Frost was A. Hamilton Bolton's successor as the reigning dean of the Wave Principle. Everything he ever published on the subject is in this book. In his 1967 and 1970 Elliott Wave supplements to The Bank Credit Analyst, Frost forecasts the ending level for the 1966-1974 bear markets in the Dow to the point and entertains us with two spirited Q&A's. Also included is a 1968 supplement by Russell L. Hall, which was co-written by Frost, along with letters between Dr. Max Resnick and Charles J. Collins. These reprints, compiled by Robert Prechter, along with those in our companion novel, The Complete Elliott Wave Writings of A. Hamilton Bolton, complete the presentation of the Bank Credit Analyst's entire Elliott wave output. The incomparable Richard Russell of Dow Theory Letters, who conferred often with Frost, brilliantly blazed the market's trail in the 1970s. Every word Russell wrote about the Wave Principle is here too, including one of the greatest calls of all time: his recognition of the end of the bear market at the December 1974 low. Ending our tome is a delightful section revealing some of A.J.'s more general thoughts on the Wave Principle and markets.

This book describes the culture of the Kashubian community, illustrated with over 200 vintage images. It salvages a history that has almost been amalgamated into the swirling melting pot because of the difficulty of their language, the spelling of their names, and the lack of recognition of their efforts. From the first Polish-American fighters who gave their lives to the Civil War, to the lumber mills that offered so many new residents means of survival, these photographs visually outline the experiences of the earliest Kashubian immigrants, and a history nearly lost.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yGAHcv64I2MC&dq=The+Kashubian+Polish+Community+of+Southeastern+Minnesota+(MN)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cat who went to heaven","description":"In ancient Japan, a struggling artist is angered when his housekeeper brings home a tiny white cat he can barely afford to feed. But when the village s head priest commissions a painting of the Buddha for a healthy sum, the artist softens toward the animal he believes has brought him luck. According to legend, the proud and haughty cat was denied the Buddha s blessing for refusing to accept his teachings and pay him homage. So when the artist, moved by compassion for his pet, includes the cat in his painting, the priest rejects the work and decrees that it must be destroyed. It seems the artist s life is ruined as well until he is rewarded for his act of love by a Buddhist miracle. This timeless fable has been a classic since its first publication in 1930, and this beautifully reillustrated edition brings the magic and wonder of the tale to a new generation of readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T-k4Iuh0f9wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradox: Book I of the Nulapeiron Sequence (Bk. 1)","description":"Centuries of self-imposed isolation have transformed Nulapeiron into a world unlike any other - a world of vast subterranean cities maintained by extraordinary organic technologies. For the majority of its peoples, however such wonders have little meaning. Denied their democratic rights and restricted to the impoverished lower levels, they are subjected to the brutal law of the Logic Lords and the Oracles, supra-human beings whose ability to truecast the future maintains the status quo. But all this is about to change. In a crowded marketplace a mysterious, beautiful woman is brutally cut down by a militia squad's graser fire. Amongst the horrified onlookers is young Tom Corcorigan. He recognizes her. Only the previous day she had presented him with a small, seemingly insignificant info-crystal. And only now, as the fire in the dying stranger's obsidian eyes fades, does he comprehend who - or what - she really was: a figure from legend, one of the fabled Pilots. What Tom has still to discover is that his crystal holds the key to understanding mu-space, and so to freedom itself. He doesn't know it yet, but he has been given a destiny to fulfill - nothing less than the rewriting of his future, and that of his world... Spectacularly staged, thrillingly written and set in a visionary future, Paradox places John Meaney at the forefront of science fiction in this new century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4-GKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No More Prisons: Urban Life, Homeschooling, Hip-Hop Leadership, the Cool Rich Kids Movement, a Hitchhiker's Guide to Community Organizing & Why Philanthropy.. the Greatest Art Form of the 21st Century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=llOKtwAACAAJ&dq=No+More+Prisons:+Urban+Life,+Homeschooling,+Hip-Hop+Leadership,+the+Cool+Rich+Kids+Movement,+a+Hitchhiker%27s+Guide+to+Community+Organizing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cheerleader's Guide to Life","description":"A former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader offers step-by-step procedures for cheerleading hopefuls, providing advice on nutrition and fitness, interview guidelines, and applying cheerleading skills to a career.

The author believes that the work of art can only be fully appreciated when it is regarded as the product of both the artist's hand and mind. This study utilizes the traditional sources, such as contemporary theoretical writings and iconographical analysis, but in addition draws on the scientific findings of the conservation laboratories. This is a new body of data assembled in large part since World War II, which art historians are only beginning to exploit to fill out the history of technique. Rather than writing merely a history of technique, however, the author has integrated this material with traditional approaches to cultural history. She undertakes to examine twenty major paintings of the period from Giotto to Tintoretto to elucidate how colour and technique contribute to their meaning. She gives us then, the first modern consideration of Renaissance paintings both as physical objects and as monuments of cultural history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m-VzQgAACAAJ&dq=Color+and+Meaning:+Practice+and+Theory+in+Renaissance+Painting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elric!

These principles have been used consistently by many of the highest achievers in our society. If they can use these concepts to reach success, then they can also be used by everyone to achieve victory. The book Defining Success: One Word at a Time starts with defining and visualizing the end result: victory. From there, concepts like faith, passion, knowledge, and patience are introduced to the reader as building blocks toward success. Finally, the book ends with an all-encompassing definition of success. This definition, like all of the success keywords before it, includes the previous concepts outlined in this book. Projects, known as Call-to-Action exercises, are located throughout the book as samples that can be used to supplement the success keywords.

This volume of plays, translated from the Italian by Mark Musa, opens with Six Characters in Search of an Author, in which six characters invade the stage and demand to be included in the play. The tragedy Henry IV dramatizes the lucid madness of a man who may be King. In So It Is (If You Think So), the townspeople exercise a morbid curiosity attempting to discover  the truth  about the Ponza family. Each of these plays can lay claim to being Pirandello s masterpiece, and in exploring the nature of human personality, each one stretches the resources of drama to their limits.

Only so long as telepathy, clairvoyance and materialization appear as something out of the ordinary are they surrounded by an aura of mystery. Occultism and Modern Science offers investigations into the domains of Spiritualism and parapsychology through an examination of classic cases of purported mediums and the conflicting revelations of the Theosophical movement.

Transport Logistics first presents ten case studies of historical projects that demanded careful transport logistics management. It surveys a wide variety of projects, some of them successes and some of them failures. The second part of the book examines various aspects of today's dynamic freight logistics industry, including the changing role of the freight forwarder. With the development of IT-based supply chain integration and value-added service offerings, the freight forwarder is being forced to evolve, or else risk extinction. In addition, ensuring cargo security has become an irreversible part of the forwarder's responsibility to customers and other supply chain partners. Finally, an examination of the freight logistics industries of Egypt, China, South Africa, India, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates provides some perspective on the varied environments in which forwarders operate and illuminates the need for trade and transport facilitation as a means to economic growth. In the book's third and final section, Mr. Baluch looks at the future of the transport logistics industry, which will continue to evolve as a result of globalization, the digitalization of information, new technologies, rising energy costs, and changing trade patterns. He also presents railways as the eco-friendly freight solution of the future, especially in the Middle East and Africa. Transport Logistics concludes with an emphasis on the importance of training and the role of national and international associations in developing a culture of quality, security, and innovation in the freight logistics profession.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TpsgAQAAMAAJ&dq=Transport+Logistics:+Past,+Present+and+Predictions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-American Annie Sticker Paper Doll (Dover Little Activity Books)","description":"Red, white, and blue are Annie's colors of choice for jeans, T-shirts, sweaters, and accessories.

We are living in a time when you can believe anything, as long as you do not claim it to be true. In the name of  tolerance,  our postmodern culture embraces everything from Eastern mysticism to New Age spirituality. But as Ravi Zacharias points out, such unquestioning acceptance of all things spiritual is absurd. All religions, plainly and simply, cannot be true. Jesus Among Other Gods provides the answers to the most fundamental claims about Christianity, such as: Aren t all religions fundamentally the same? Was Jesus who He claimed to be? Can one study the life of Christ and demonstrate conclusively that He was and is the way, the truth, and the life? In each chapter, Zacharias considers a unique claim that Jesus made and then contrasts the truth of Jesus with the founders of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism with compelling insight and passionate conviction. In addition to an impressive breadth of reading and study, he shares his personal journey from despair and meaninglessness to his discovery that Jesus is who He said He is.  In Jesus Among Other Gods, Ravi Zacharias demonstrates that he is one of the most intellectually gifted as well as spiritually sensitive writers of today s leading apologists for the Christian faith. Zacharias brings alive the unique power of the claims of Jesus about himself and the utter relevance of his message today for the human condition.

The Shakta is so called because he is a worshipper of Shakti (Power), that is, God in Mother-form as the Supreme Power which creates, sustains and withdraws the universe. His rule of life is Shaktadharma, his doctrine of Shakti is Shaktivada or Shakta Darshana. God is worshipped as the Great Mother because, in this aspect, God is active, and produces, nourishes, and maintains all. Theological Godhead is no more female than male or neuter. God is Mother to the Sadhaka who worships Her Lotus Feet, the dust on which are millions of universes.

Today the term is regularly thrown around by lawmakers and pundits on both sides of the aisle. But as these heated accusations flood the news cycle, it s not always clear what the crime of treason truly is, or when it should be prosecuted. Drawing on over two decades of research, constitutional law and legal history scholar Carlton Larson takes us on a grand tour of the Treason Clause of the United States Constitution. Despite the Clause s apparent simplicity, Larson demonstrates that it is a form of constitutional quicksand in which seemingly obvious intuitions are often far off the mark. From the floors of the medieval British Parliament that codified the Statute of Treasons upon which the American law was based to the treason of Benedict Arnold, our nation s founding traitor, to more recent events, including WWII s  Tokyo Rose  and the allegations against Edward Snowden and Donald Trump, Larson provides a riveting account of treason law in action. On Treason is an indispensable guide for anyone who wants to understand this fundamental aspect of our legal system.

She wedded Justin Leroux suddenly and silently. He was the tall dark stranger of her girlhood dreams, and had finally come to take her away. She returns with him to Sans Songe, the Leroux family plantation in Louisiana. A near-fatal accident on the road to the plantation does not bode well for her future there. And indeed, many nasty surprises await her at the plantation itself. Voodoo magic, poisoned food, and a murder mystery force Claire into a stalemate. She is helpless within the bosom of her frigid and isolating new family, while her husband has yet to come to her bed.

But Charlie barely has time to sample a veggie meal and bond with Jack s bronze Buddha statue before she runs into trouble: Local gossip Georgette Glick and her Schwinn bicycle have just been found under the wheels of Charlie s Toyota which makes Charlie the prime suspect in Georgette s murder. Luckily, Moot Point sheriff Bennett discovers that Glick was shot, not run over, so Charlie is in the clear. But there are still too many unanswered questions. Who delivered the fatal bullet to Glick s head? And why was the seventy-eight-year-old riding her bike on a night with zero visibility in the first place? Alongside Sheriff Bennett, whose interest in Charlie seems decidedly more than professional, she resolves to find the murderer among the town s eccentrics, who include the suspiciously nongrieving widower, a holistic veterinarian, the victim s terrified neighbor, and a Byronic artist whose painting of a century-old local shipwreck matches the one in Charlie s recent nightmares. With the killer still at large, Charlie may be tempting an out-of-body experience of her own in this quirky and suspenseful novel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-EZfBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Days of wine and roses;","description":"THE STORY: In the fast-moving milieu of Madison Avenue, social drinking is almost an occupational necessity, and one that fast-rising young Joe Clay adopts with too ready ease.

The main emphasis is placed on a comprehensive classificatory scheme that highlights underlying patterns and dynamics, rather than particular historical manifestations of organized crime. Esteemed author Klaus von Lampe strategically breaks the book down into three key dimensions: (1) illegal activities, (2) patterns of interpersonal relations that are directly or indirectly supporting these illegal activities, and (3) overarching illegal power structures that regulate and control these illegal activities and also extend their influence into the legal spheres of society. Within this framework, numerous case studies and topical issues from a variety of countries illustrate meaningful application of the conceptual and theoretical discussion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0VY0CgAAQBAJ&dq=Dr.+Snow:+How+the+F.B.I.+Nailed+an+Ivy+League+Coke+King+(Signet)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emma Lazarus in Her World: Life and Letters","description":"The biography and selected letters of this literary great includes over 60 newly discovered letters written to many other literary giants of the time, including Robert Browning and William Morris.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=da8rJnTp7mAC&dq=Emma+Lazarus+in+Her+World:+Life+and+Letters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Biggest Job We'll Ever Have: The Hyde School Program for Character-Based Education and Parenting","description":"The president and director of family education at the Hyde School, which emphasizes attitude over aptitude, effort over achievement, and character over talent, demonstrate how parents can enhance their children's education by improving family dynamics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_kslAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Biggest+Job+We%27ll+Ever+Have:+The+Hyde+School+Program+for+Character-Based+Education+and+Parenting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The God Theory","description":"As science integrates the in-depth knowledge of the physical world accumulated over the past three centuries, it will be channeled into a new and exciting line of inquiry that acknowledges the expanded reality of consciousness as a creative force in the universe and the spiritual creative power embodied in our own minds. This book summarizes the thoughts of an inquisitive, but open-minded, scientist. What I present here is a theory that looks promising, not scientific proof. It should not be surprising, however, if some of what I propose coincides with theories propounded by others who claim a more intimate relationship with the Almighty. After all, if I am on the right track, and if they are, it would be worrisome if we were not, ultimately, in agreement. All I ask is that you seriously consider the logic of my theory, especially if it challenges you to question what you were taught - in Sunday school, in catechism or, dare I say, in physics class. I offer this book, not as a theological treatise, but as a short, readable exposition of a worldview that can bring sense and purpose into individual lives, and tolerance and peace to a planet whose future is in serious jeopardy - in large part because of the irrational dogmatism of both religion and science. If I am correct, we are literally all one being (God) in many individual forms.

Chemical warfare affected tactics and almost changed the outcome of World War I. The overwhelming success of the first use of gas caught both sides by surprise. Fortunately, the pace of hostilities permitted the Allies to develop a suitable defense to German gas attacks and eventually to field a considerable offensive chemical capability. Nonetheless, from the introduction of chemical warfare in early 1915 until Armistice Day in November, 1918, the Allies were usually one step behind their German counterparts in the development of gas doctrine and the employment of gas tactics and procedures. In his final report to Congress on World War I, General John J. Pershing expressed the sentiment of contemporary senior officers when he said, \\"Whether or not gas will be employed in future wars is a matter of conjecture, but the effect is so deadly to the unprepared that we can never afford to neglect the question.\\" General Pershing was the last American field commander actually to confront chemical agents on the battlefield. Today, in light of a significant Soviet chemical threat and solid evidence of chemical warfare in Southeast and Southwest Asia, it is by no means certain he will retain that distinction. Over 50 percent of the Total Army's Chemical Corps assets are located within the United States Army Reserve. This Leavenworth Paper was prepared by the USAA Staff Officer serving with the Combat Studies Institute, USACGSC, after a number of requests from USAA Chemical Corps officers for a historical study on the nature of chemical warfare in World War I. Despite originally being published in 1984, this Leavenworth Paper also meets the needs of the Total Army in its preparations to fight, if necessary, on a battlefield where chemical agents might be employed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ddspvAEACAAJ&dq=Chemical+Warfare+in+World+War+I:+The+American+Experience,+1917-1918+(Leavenworth+Papers+No.+10)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flossie & the Fox (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","description":"Flossie carefully stores her straw doll in a hollow tree stump when Big Mama calls her away from play.

Drawing heavily on early textual evidence this work questions the validity of such a \\"Mah?y?na schools\\" hypothesis. By down-playing the late commentorial traditions, the author attempts a general reappraisal of the epistemological and ontological writings of Nagarjuna, Asanga and Vasubandhu. He concludes that the overlap in all areas of doctrine is significant, but particularly with respect to the teachings on the levels of truth, the enlightened and unenlightened states, the status of language and the nature of reality. It is hoped that such investigations may provide the basis for a new theory on the proliferation of Indian Mah?y?na Buddhism as an organic process of assimilation to new audiences, and specific contemporary problems, rather than in the more schismatic manner favoured by past researchers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fLZeKatsbaYC&dq=The+Continuity+of+Madhyamaka+and+Yog%3Fc%3Fra+in+Indian+Mah%3Fy%3Fna+Buddhism+(Brill%27s+Indological+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver in America, 1840-1940: A Century of Splendor","description":"This volume explores the history and development of the American silver industry.

Whether such contact is the result of tourism, seeking exile, or relocating abroad, the volume's contributors demonstrate how one's identity, cultural assumptions, and worldview can be brought into question. In some cases, the traveller finds that bridging the social and cultural gap between himself and the new society is fairly easy. In other cases, the traveller discovers that reorienting himself requires absorbing a new cultural history and traditions. The contributors argue that making these adjustments will surely enhance the traveller's or tourist's experience; otherwise the traveller or tourist will be at risk of becoming a marginalized figure, one disconnected from the society that surrounds him. This latest volume in the Culture & Civilization series features a collection of essays on travel and tourism. The essays cover a range of topics from historical travels to modern social identities. They discuss ancient travels, contemporary travels in Europe, Africa and sustainable eco-tourism, and the politics of tourism. Essays also address experiences of Grenada's \\"Spice Island\\" identity, and the effects of globalization and migrations on personal identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rm5QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Two Princesses of Bamarre","description":"When plague strikes Bamarre, Princess Addie must fulfill an ancient prophecy.

He brings to life and unifies the many observations, emotions and subtle and not-so-subtle actions that revolve around the person of God the Son as he faces his most tragic and triumphant moment. The author s unique approach intersperses Scripture accounts with the commentary of an incisive narrator who sifts and judges from the span of hundreds of years. He draws from the obvious as well as the obscure, and finds supernatural meaning in the most mundane actions that surround the suffering Christ. In the hands of this writer, the Lord s few words, accompanied by the author s commentary, challenge contemporary believers as much as they did those who first followed in the footsteps of Christ and his apostles. The author was born in 1869 in Lancashire, northern England and educated at the prominent Catholic college, Stonyhurst, which has been the source of many English Catholic politicians, intellectuals and business people. After a degree from the University of London, he was ordained a Jesuit in 1903. He served as archbishop of Bombay from 1919 to 1926 and returned to England to write and serve as a chaplain until his death in 1939.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_UGfDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Percival Keene (Notable novels)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lost In Space","description":"A thrilling, original novel based on Netflix's smash hit Lost in Space!

Wade","description":"Pulitzer Prizewinning author David J. Garrow s stirring and essential history of the politics of abortion and America s battle for the right to choose In 1973, the Supreme Court handed down its landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and more than forty years later the issue continues to spark controversy and divisiveness. But behind this historic legal case lie the battles women fought to establish their rights to use contraceptives and choose to have an abortion. Liberty and Sexuality traces these political and legal struggles in the decades leading up to Roe v. Wade including the momentous 1965 Supreme Court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut that established a constitutional  right to privacy.  Garrow personalizes the struggles by detailing the vital contributions made by dozens of crusaders who tirelessly paved the way. This expansive and substantial work also addresses the threats to sexual privacy and the legality of abortion that have risen since Roe v. Wade. With abortion still a contentious subject on the national political landscape, Liberty and Sexuality is not just a historical account of the right to choose, but an indispensable read about preserving a freedom that continues to divide America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CiRwCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Flaqueza Del Bolchevique","description":"El protagonista y narrador de esta historia se empotra contra el descapotable de una irritante ejecutiva en lunes a las ocho de la ma?ana.

Five years ago, after learning he had cancer, Julius tried to make peace with his three sons. It didn't take. Now, the disease has gone into remission. Overjoyed, Julius is grateful for this miracle, and the time it affords him to make up for his past mistakes. It won't be easy. In Chicago, life isn't exactly simple for his three grown sons. The oldest, Austin, a successful attorney, struggles to be a good father to his children despite his ex-wife's attempts to turn them against him. Marcus, the middle son, wrestles with a fear of commitment that drives away the woman he loves. And young Caleb, just released from prison, fights to rebuild his life and win back his wife and child.

She tests this idea of subjection against historical realities--legal, religious, economic, social, intellectual, military, political, and philosophical--and finds it to be meritless. Beard traces the error back to Sir William Blackstone's interpretation of women's legal status after marrying (\\"the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during marriage\\") and argues against this view. In answer to male historians who have failed to acknowledge the real influence of women in history, she provides a lengthy record of outstanding women and their contributions throughout history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A1QrAAAAYAAJ&dq=Woman+As+Force+in+History:+A+Study+in+Traditions+and+Realities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding The Scarlet Letter: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents (The Greenwood Press \\"Literature in Context\\" Series)","description":"Gathers historical documents that illustrate Puritan and nineteenth-century attitudes, and shares contemporaneous reviews and current relevant news articles","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gg0CiGmm1OIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stuff a Girl's Gotta Know: Little Hints for Big Things in a Girl's Life","description":"The zillion things a teen girl needs to know in life are all together in \\"Stuff a Girl's Gotta Know.\\" Popular teen author Andrea Stephens addresses girl stuff, growing up stuff, girl- friend stuff, God stuff, guy stuff and grades n' stuff.

When readers enter such textual worlds, which are strange and complex, they are confronted with theological claims. With this in mind, the purpose of the IBT series is to help serious readers in their experience of reading and interpreting by providing guides for their journeys into textual worlds. The focus of the series is not so much on the world behind the text as on the worlds created by the texts in their engagement with readers. Nowhere is the world of the biblical text stranger than in the apocalyptic literature of both the Old and New Testaments. In this volume, Stephen Cook makes the puzzling visions and symbols of the biblical apocalyptic literature intelligible to modern readers. He begins with definitions of apocalypticism and apocalyptic literature and introduces the various scholarly approaches to and issues for our understanding of the text. Cook introduces the reader to the social and historical worlds of the apocalyptic groups that gave rise to such literature and leads the reader into a better appreciation and understanding of the theological import of biblical apocalyptic literature. In the second major section of the book, Cook guides the reader through specific examples of the Bible s apocalyptic literature. He addresses both the best-known examples (the biblical books of Daniel and Revelation) and other important but lesser known examples (Zechariah and some words of Jesus and Paul).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SUSqAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters to a Black Boy","description":"The racial unrest and problems of the black American in the 60's are reflected in a black father's letters to his son","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fo-rpwAACAAJ&dq=Letters+to+a+Black+Boy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broncho Apache","description":"Apache Indian escapes from the prison train bearing Geronimo and his band into exile.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bJNLAAAAIAAJ&dq=Broncho+Apache&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anything, My Love","description":"Derinda James, the feisty, strong-willed, Boston-bred beauty, is excited to learn of the man who had sired her and travels into the wild Arizona Territory to meet the one time soldier and gunfighter.

In 1941, the Pacific Clipper was a technological marvel and the finest commercial plane in the air. Not only did Japan and Germany seek the capture of such a desirable prize, but America's allies and friends looked for ways of laying claim to her. Trapped in New Zealand after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, with all their Pacific bases under attack or captured, the valiant crew of eleven men challenged the Imperial Japanese Navy, 30,000 miles of uncharted waters, and the German Luftwaffe to try for a safe landing in America. With courage and skill, the crew of the Pacific Clipper eluded the pursuing Japanese through Australia, Indonesia, Ceylon, and India. In Iran, the Germans took up the chase through Egypt, the Congo, and Brazil. After a final stop at Trinidad, the heroic crew brought the Clipper home to New York and the final showdown.

Japanese miniature landscapes and, particularly, dwarf trees-\\"bonsai,\\" as they are frequently called even in the West-have long been admired throughout the world. It may come as a surprise to inexperienced gardeners but the creation and care of bonsai is a comparatively simple art which can actually be systematically taught rather than, as in earlier books on the subject, just talked about vaguely. Now, given a reasonably green thumb and a modicum of patience, anyone in any country can create his own bonsai. The Japanese art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes contains detailed instructions, together with many helpful diagrams and charts and a treasury of photographs, on every phase of the art: propagation and training, with hints for those in a hurry and for small-apartment dwellers; daily and seasonal care, and treatment of pests; how to judge, select, and exhibit bonsai, with emphasis always upon the untold enjoyment they can provide. Included also, for those who want still more detailed information, are invaluable appendices concerning tools and equipment, soil analyses, and precise data on the more than three hundred species of plants used in making bonsai.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6xXRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Style for Today's Home","description":"There's nothing better than a little joie de vivre to brighten up your decor!

Although being fundamentally written for mathematicians, the authors make an attempt to reach both the practitioner and the theoretician by blending the theory with applications. They maintain a good balance between the mathematical integrity of the text and the conceptual simplicity that might be required by engineers.

Greeley written such a searing and topical novel about the state of the Catholic Church. The Priestly Sins tells the story of Father Herman Hoffman, a gifted and innocent young man from the distant prairies of the Great Plains. In the first summer of his first parish appointment, Hoffman is swept up in The Crisis after witnessing child abuse in the parish rectory. He tells the pastor, the father of the victim, and the local police but is rebuffed by the archbishop. Soon he is vilified for denouncing a priest who has been \\"cleared\\" by the police and learns the harsh fate of the whistle-blower in the contemporary Catholic church: He is locked up in a mental-health center and then sent into exile to do graduate study. In Chicago to study immigrant history, he encounters the local \\"Vicar for Extern Priests,\\" the legendary Monsignor Blackie Ryan, who helps him regain his confidence. Hoffman returns home to demand a parish of his own from the archbishop. Reluctantly, the church hierarchy assigns him to a dying parish, but by his zeal and charm Hoffman revives the local church. His brief idyll is shattered by a subpoena to testify in a court hearing. If he speaks, he will have to take on the \\"downtown\\" establishment that is determined to destroy him and many of his fellow priests who want to be rid of this painful reminder of a sinful past. Hoffman faces exile not only from his parish, but from the priesthood itself.

First published in 1934, it is here available for the first time in an authorized English translation. A realistic tale in the best tradition of the novels of social protest of Zola, Dosto-evsky, Jos  Eustasio Rivera, and the Mexican novels of the Revolution, The Villagers (Huasipungo) shocked and horrified its readers, and brought its author mingled censure and acclaim, when it was first published in 1934. Deeply moving in the dramatic intensity of its relentless evolution and stark human suffering, Icaza's novel has been translated into eleven foreign languages, including Russian and Chinese, and has gone through numerous editions in Spanish, including a revised and enlarged edition in 1953, on which this translation is based, but it has never before been authorized for translation into English. His first novel, but not his first published work, The Villagers is still considered by most critics as Icaza's best, and it is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant works in contemporary Latin American literature. Thirty years after its original publication in Ecuador, The Villagers still carries a powerful message for the contemporary world and an urgent warning. The conditions here portrayed prevail in these areas, even today. The Villagers is an indictment of the latifundista system and a caustic picture of the native worker who, with little expectation from life, finds himself a victim of an antiquated feudal system aided and abetted by a grasping clergy and an indifferent govern-ment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tZyu-pN0yz4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fiction First Aid","description":"Every writer struggles with spots that \\"just aren't working\\"in their manuscript.

Vallone was, after the mayor, the most powerful political official in New York City. This book is the story of how he got from a clubhouse in Astoria to the levers of power in City Hall--in the process overturning, with the help of the U.S. Supreme Court, the very structure of the city's government. It is simultaneously a chronicle of New York City politics over the past thirty-five years. Although a major figure in New York State (he was Democratic candidate for Governor in 1998), and for a while even in national politics, Vallone never left his roots in a typical New York City neighborhood. A strong family man, a strong Catholic, a loyal Democrat, he was notorious for fighting for the \\"common man\\" as well as the amateur legislator. He was the ideal foil for three of New York City's most colorful mayors: Ed Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliiani. A seeming anomaly in an age of media saturation, Vallone's story is both vital history and a primer in tolerance and good government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q12dPAAACAAJ&dq=Learning+to+Govern:+My+Life+in+New+York+Politics,+From+Hell+Gate+to+City+Hall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Access Washington, D.C.

Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) \\"any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods.\\" His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control. In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is. In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers. Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris. Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qQMFOctR7AoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghosts,: A family drama in three acts (Ibsen's plays)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5WdGAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing in China: An Executive Survival Guide","description":"Managing in China - An Executive Survival Guide is based on dozens of interviews with expats from all over the world who are living and working in China.

To interest a child in these guests of our groves, - these feathered entertainers who are also workers in our fields and orchards, - is to put him in possession of a wellspring of interest as enduring as life itself.

Upon her father's ascension to the illustrious throne of England, Elizabeth Stuart was suddenly thrust from the poverty of unruly Scotland into the fairy-tale existence of a princess of great wealth and splendor. When she was married at sixteen to a German count far below her rank, it was with the understanding that her father would help her husband achieve the kingship of Bohemia. The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin \\"the Winter Queen,\\" as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher Ren  Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost. But it was the youngest, Sophia, a heroine in the tradition of a Jane Austen novel, whose ready wit and good-natured common sense masked immense strength of character, who fulfilled the promise of her great-grandmother Mary and reshaped the British monarchy, a legacy that endures to this day. Brilliantly researched and captivatingly written, filled with danger, treachery, and adventure but also love, courage, and humor, Daughters of the Winter Queen follows the lives of five remarkable women who, by refusing to surrender to adversity, changed the course of history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AOsvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Cheap's Boston (Mr.Cheap's Travel)","description":"The definitive guide for bargain-hunters throughout the nation, this handy reference gives the low-down on bargains, factory outlets, off-price stores, discount stores, cheap eats, cheap places to stay, and cheap fun things to do.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YhsKAAAACAAJ&dq=Mr.+Cheap%27s+Boston+(Mr.Cheap%27s+Travel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Note: The Magical Gift of Unconditional Love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ij9dROZcRhAC&dq=The+First+Note:+The+Magical+Gift+of+Unconditional+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plants are like people","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LrfYvgEACAAJ&dq=Plants+are+like+people&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"52 Weeks in the California Garden","description":"Make the most of the Golden State's unique climate and planting conditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7YWsngEACAAJ&dq=52+Weeks+in+the+California+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Slum and the Ghetto: Housing Reform and Neighborhood Work in Chicago, 1880-1930 (The Urban Life in America)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wkqdoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Slum+and+the+Ghetto:+Housing+Reform+and+Neighborhood+Work+in+Chicago,+1880-1930+(The+Urban+Life+in+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The third Arab-Israeli war","description":"Suicide attacks on Israelis, bombings, assassinations, and bloodshed in Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank dominate the news from the Middle East. It is the most troubled region on earth. At its heart is the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis - and the legacy of six days of war in 1967. After the state of Israel emerged from war in 1948, both sides knew more battles were coming. In June 1967, years of slow-burning tension exploded. In six extraordinary days, Israel destroyed the armed forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. But far from bringing peace, as many Israelis hoped, their stunning victory turned into a curse. From the initial battle order issued to the Israeli air force on Monday June 5, 1967 to the final ceasefire on the evening of Saturday the 10th, the Six-Day War was a riveting human drama. Building on his first-hand experience of the region after his five years as the BBC's Middle East Correspondent, as well as extensive original research, Jeremy Bowen presents a compelling new history of the conflict. Six Days recreates day by day, hour by hour, the bullying and brinckmanship that led four nations to war, interweaving testimonies of combatants from all sides in a seamless narrative. A rigorous and original piece of modern history is as vivid as fiction, Six Days not only sheds new light on one of the key conflicts of the twentieth century, it explains much about the Middle East and the problems the region still faces today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1a9_AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fox Young America Orchestra Folio Vol. 1: Piano (Conductor's Score), All Compositions Arranged By J.

Who invented our modern ideas of democracy and free market capitalism? The Scots. As historian and author Arthur Herman reveals, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Scotland made crucial contributions to science, philosophy, literature, education, medicine, commerce, and politics contributions that have formed and nurtured the modern West ever since. Herman has charted a fascinating journey across the centuries of Scottish history. Here is the untold story of how John Knox and the Church of Scotland laid the foundation for our modern idea of democracy; how the Scottish Enlightenment helped to inspire both the American Revolution and the U.S. Constitution; and how thousands of Scottish immigrants left their homes to create the American frontier, the Australian outback, and the British Empire in India and Hong Kong. How the Scots Invented the Modern World reveals how Scottish genius for creating the basic ideas and institutions of modern life stamped the lives of a series of remarkable historical figures, from James Watt and Adam Smith to Andrew Carnegie and Arthur Conan Doyle, and how Scottish heroes continue to inspire our contemporary culture, from William  Braveheart  Wallace to James Bond. And no one who takes this incredible historical trek will ever view the Scots or the modern West in the same way again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3e9DAT257LkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highpocket's War Stories","description":"\\"Winner of the United States Marine Corps Gazette 2005 Francis Fox Parry Combat Initiative Award.\\" Highpocket's War Stories is an eloquent account of combat leadership in Korea and Vietnam.

Includes \\"The Devil in the White House\\" and \\"The Development of Iraq as a Case for the Files.\\" At once a genuine story-teller and a literary documentarian, Alexander Kluge's genius lies in the very special way he makes found material his own. Each of the miniatures collected here touches on \\"facts\\" and is only several pages long. In just a paragraph he can etch a whole world: he is as great a master of compression as Kafka or Kawabata. Arranged in five chapters, the dozens of stories of The Devil's Blind Spot are condensed, like novels in pill form. The first group of stories illustrates the little-known virtues of the Devil. The second explores love from Kant and opera through the Grand Guignol. The third is entitled \\"Sarajevo Is Everywhere\\" and tests how convincing power is. The fourth group concerns the cosmos, and the fifth ranges all our \\"knowledge\\" against our feelings. In each piece, Kluge alights on precise particulars: on board the atomic submarine Kursk, for instance, we are marched precisely step by step through a black comedy of the exact, disastrous stages of thinking that lead to catastrophe. Sample titles include \\"The Devil in the White House,\\" \\"The Development of Iraq as a Case for the Files,\\" \\"Intelligence of the Second Degree,\\" and \\"Love's Mouth Also Kisses the Dog.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L4WPB_PJQwcC&dq=The+Devil%27s+Blind+Spot:+Tales+from+the+New+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Dimensions of Gender and Carework","description":"Why are women such prominent workers in the global marketplace? Why do so many perform jobs that involve carework? What political forces have made these women key participants in globalization? What are the consequences for the women themselves, for their families, and for societies and international relations in general? This book offers a provocative examination of globalization, examining the lives of the women at the center of these new global dynamics. Arguing that society is facing multiple crises of care, the authors develop a new framework for understanding the interplay of globalization, gender, and carework. In four original essays, they examine gender, race, and class inequality; migration, citizenship, and the politics of social control; the evolving meanings of motherhood; and new social definitions of carework and the personal transformation of careworkers. Excerpts from the classic works in the field as well as recent cutting-edge research studies support the examination of each of these growing global crises.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MK70zgEACAAJ&dq=Global+Dimensions+of+Gender+and+Carework&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islands in the Stream","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HFDTAgAACAAJ&dq=Islands+in+the+Stream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Armed Servants: Agency, Oversight, and Civil-Military Relations","description":"The agency theory model presented in this text challenges the professionalism-based model of civil-military relations and provides an innovative way of making sense of the US Cold War and post-Cold War experience, especially the stormy civil-military relations of the Clinton presidency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nbgHnwEACAAJ&dq=Armed+Servants:+Agency,+Oversight,+and+Civil-Military+Relations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Make One Million Dollars in Real Estate in Three Years Starting with No Cash","description":"A fully revised BusinessWeek bestseller that will help even beginning investors cash in on the 21st-century real estate boom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ilGpkzVGtdEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hegel (The Routledge Philosophers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Your Life as Story","description":"In Your Life As Story, autobiography expert Tristine Rainer explains how we can all find the important messages in our lives.

Most of the research has been published elsewhere, but such is the relevance of the experiments cited to the whole schema that the monograph has unique value. It is a synthesis which portrays the contribution to date of cognitive science to the biology and psychopathology of delusional thinking, and convincingly demonstrates that this way of looking at things has a considerable future. There are important implications for therapy as well as for hypothesis formulation. The monograph is attractively written, and the authors present their claims with exemplary modesty. The whole tenor of their approach gives weight to the conviction that here we have a story that must be taken seriously. It is a significant book, and I warmly commend it to all those with an interest in the future of psychopathology, and especially to psychiatrists who wish to advance their understanding of mental states and avoid stagnating with outworn dogma.\\" - Robert Cawley, University of London in British Journal of Psychiatry Delusions are a key symptom of psychosis and yet there is no single book which considers delusions from a psychological perspective. In part this is because the syndrome of schizophrenia has captured the attention of many workers, and in part because delusions, as private mental phenomena, are not well suited to purely behavioural or observational methods of enquiry. For the past two decades, however, cognitive psychology has been in its ascendancy and delusions, as beliefs, are particularly amenable to investigation applying cognitive concepts and methods. Within this framework, it is possible to consider continuities between delusional and ordinary beliefs, as well as to seek to identify differences. This book, therefore, uniquely presents a psychological model of delusions, employing the neglected strategy of single symptom research and the tools of cognitive psychology","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q746SU78SYoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java and JMX: Building Manageable Systems","description":"Java is now used with increasing frequency to develop mission-critical applications.

Rather than the \\"quintessential American religion,\\" as it has been dubbed by contemporary scholars, in the late nineteenth century Mormonism was America's most vilified homegrown faith. A vast national campaign featuring politicians, church leaders, social reformers, the press, women's organizations, businessmen, and ordinary citizens sought to end the distinctive Latter-day Saint practice of plural marriage, and to extinguish the entire religion if need be. Placing the movement against polygamy in the context of American and southern history, Mason demonstrates that anti-Mormonism was one of the earliest vehicles for reconciliation between North and South after the Civil War and Reconstruction. Southerners joined with northern reformers and Republicans to endorse the use of newly expanded federal power to vanquish the perceived threat to Christian marriage and the American republic. Anti-Mormonism was a significant intellectual, legal, religious, and cultural phenomenon, but in the South it was also violent. While southerners were concerned about distinctive Mormon beliefs and political practices, they were most alarmed at the \\"invasion\\" of Mormon missionaries in their communities and the prospect of their wives and daughters falling prey to polygamy. Moving to defend their homes and their honor against this threat, southerners turned to legislation, to religion, and, most dramatically, to vigilante violence. The Mormon Menace provides new insights into some of the most important discussions of the late nineteenth century and of our own age, including debates over the nature and limits of religious freedom; the contest between the will of the people and the rule of law; and the role of citizens, churches, and the state in regulating and defining marriage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bPr_gAiM9tEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonderful Power: The Story of Ancient Copper Working in the Lake Superior Basin (Great Lakes Books)","description":"This work examines the archaeological record of copper mining in the Lake Superior area.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S3kc_flwYW0C&dq=Wonderful+Power:+The+Story+of+Ancient+Copper+Working+in+the+Lake+Superior+Basin+(Great+Lakes+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's plan for victory: The meaning of post millennialism","description":"Goals determine our present-day action, and if the purpose of our action is God s victory in history, then we are all the more motivated in our actions.

Twenty-five years ago a new German state came into being. How much do we really understand this new Germany, and how do its people understand themselves? Neil MacGregor argues that, uniquely for any European country, no coherent, overarching narrative of Germany's history can be constructed, for in Germany both geography and history have always been unstable. Its frontiers have constantly shifted. K?nigsberg, home to the greatest German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, is now Kaliningrad, Russia; Strasbourg, in whose cathedral Wolfgang von Geothe, Germany's greatest writer, discovered the distinctiveness of his country's art and history, now lies within the borders of France. For most of the five hundred years covered by this book Germany has been composed of many separate political units, each with a distinct history. And any comfortable national story Germans might have told themselves before 1914 was destroyed by the events of the following thirty years. German history may be inherently fragmented, but it contains a large number of widely shared memories, awarenesses, and experiences; examining some of these is the purpose of this book. MacGregor chooses objects and ideas, people and places that still resonate in the new Germany porcelain from Dresden and rubble from its ruins, Bauhaus design and the German sausage, the crown of Charlemagne and the gates of Buchenwald to show us something of its collective imagination. There has never been a book about Germany quite like it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LlKwBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing: One Childs Journey","description":"How to tackle emotional blocks & physical challenges in 5-12 year olds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=62O4Caqh0oEC&dq=Healing:+One+Childs+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Un soir, Londres","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BTWuAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seven Sisters (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Forgotten Realms)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BQi1AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Seven+Sisters+(Advanced+Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval Europe (Home university library of modern knowledge)","description":"Includes the library's annual reports for 1909-","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dJEtAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plotto : The Master Book of All Plots","description":"In the 1920s, dime store novelist William Wallace Cook painstakingly diagramed and cataloged his personal writing method--\\"Purpose, opposed by Obstacle, yields Conflict\\"--for the instruction and illumination of his fellow authors.

The consequences of defeat were momentous: The Ottomans lost half of their European territories, which led to the final collapse of their empire, and the Habsburgs turned their attention from France and the Rhine frontier to the rich pickings of the Balkans.

By the end of the war, illegal newspapers had published a total of about 26 million issues; radio guides for Allied aircraft had been set up on the coasts; boats were running timetable services between Britain, Sweden and Denmark; illegal broadcasts were transmitted regularly; German ships were unable to move from Danish harbors; and vast numbers of German troops were kept from the main fighting points by Danish sabotage of the railways and airfields, and of the factories that the Nazis thought would be invulnerable sources of vital air force and military components. It is a fantastic story, full of tales of impudent, almost foolhardy heroism. With every reason to collaborate in safety, the Danes established an international news bureau that provided the Allies with a continuous service of inside information; they shipped seven thousand Jews to safety; they organized strikes; they spirited away most of Denmark s tug fleet; they even established an office of the British Ministry of Food in Copenhagen. A quarter of a million feet of film recording their activities were shot by the Resistance under the eyes of the Gestapo, including photographs of many of their sabotage raids, which were meticulously planned.

If all goes well, human history is just beginning. Our species could survive for billions of years - enough time to end disease, poverty, and injustice, and to flourish in ways unimaginable today. But this vast future is at risk. With the advent of nuclear weapons, humanity entered a new age, where we face existential catastrophes - those from which we could never come back. Since then, these dangers have only multiplied, from climate change to engineered pathogens and artificial intelligence. If we do not act fast to reach a place of safety, it will soon be too late. Drawing on over a decade of research, The Precipice explores the cutting-edge science behind the risks we face. It puts them in the context of the greater story of humanity: showing how ending these risks is among the most pressing moral issues of our time. And it points the way forward, to the actions and strategies that can safeguard humanity. An Oxford philosopher committed to putting ideas into action, Toby Ord has advised the US National Intelligence Council, the UK Prime Minister's Office, and the World Bank on the biggest questions facing humanity. In The Precipice, he offers a startling reassessment of human history, the future we are failing to protect, and the steps we must take to ensure that our generation is not the last. \\"A book that seems made for the present moment.\\"  New Yorker","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3aSiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of the Office Witch (Charlie Greene Series, 2)","description":"A Hollywood literary agent and single mother is a reluctant sleuth and psychic in this delightfully quirky quartet of paranormal mysteries.

In February 1913, archaeologist Katherine Routledge set sail on a custom-built yacht-with a small crew and the support of British Association for the Advancement of Science, the British Museum, and the Royal Geographical Society-for Easter Island, where she embarked up the first effort to catalogue the island's mysterious statues, interview the natives, and document their culture, folklore, and traditions.

Twenty years after his tragic death-he was shot by his father-his relevance persists because of the indelible mark his outsized talent left on American culture. A transcendent performer whose career spanned the history of rhythm and blues, from doo-wop to the sultriest of soul music, Gaye's artistic scope and emotional range set the soundtrack for America's tumultuous coming of age in the 1970s. Michael Eric Dyson's searching narrative illuminates Marvin Gaye's stellar ascendance-from a black church in Washington, D.C., to the artistic peak of What's Going On?-and charts his sobering personal decline. Dyson draws from interviews with those closest to Gaye to paint an intimate portrait of the tensions and themes that shaped contemporary urban America: racism, drug abuse, economic adversity, and the long legacy of hardship. Gaye's stormy relationships with women, including duet partner Tammi Terrell and wives Anna Gordy and Janis Hunter, are examined in light of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Dyson also considers family violence in the larger context of the African-American life and how that heartbreaking legacy resulted in Gaye's murder. Mercy, Mercy, Me is an unforgettable portrait of a beloved black genius whose art is reflected in the dynamism of contemporary urban America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VOaCswEACAAJ&dq=Mercy+Mercy+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Education System Worthy of Malaysia","description":"Malaysia's highly centralized and tightly controlled system of education fails in educating and integrating the young. It is also ill suited for a plural society. Instead of the present rigid and uniform system, the writer calls for one that is flexible and diverse, but with a core of commonality. There should also be private sector participation to provide competition and spur innovation. Achieving this requires radically changing the ministry of education from one obsessed with strict top-down command, to a more democratized model with power and responsibilities delegated to the periphery. The minister is less a drill sergeant barking out orders to his raw recruits but more of a symphony conductor coaxing the best out of his skilled musicians. The reforms suggested here will make Malaysians fluently bilingual in Malay and English, science literate, and mathematically competent, as well as foster a common Malaysian identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lQivBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tulle (Salmon Poetry)","description":"The winning poetry collection in the inaugural Salmon Poetry Publication Prize 2001.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ciBbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tulle+(Salmon+Poetry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Military Quotations","description":"An authoritative compilation of military history quotes from 2000 BC to the present day.

Why can t I live right now. Because I am not rich, I am not a saint. But I do know this: not all of us were sent here to work. The first published novel of legendary poet and performer Eileen Myles follows a queer female growing up in working-class Boston, straining against the institutions that hold her: family, Catholic school, jobs at a camp, at a nursing home, at a school for developmentally disabled adult males. She wants to be an astronaut. Instead, she becomes a poet and journeys through a series of low-end schools, pathetic jobs, and unmade beds. Schooled by mean and memorable Catholic nuns, this tomboy heroine stumbles and dreams her way through the painful corridors of family, early sexual encounters, and an eye-opening series of jobs caring for the sick and insane--the abandoned wards of the state. This is a book hell-bent on telling the truth about poor women, and how they do (and do not) get out of the hands of their families and the state. Without artifice or pseudonym, protagonist Eileen Myles boldly sets down a rich and graphic account of female experience in this world. Free-ranging and deadpan, tragic and joyful, this is a book about women, gender, class, bodies, escape, and what it means to be  inside.  Never more relevant, and now with an introduction by Chris Kraus. \\"Eileen Myles is a genius!\\"--Dorothy Allison","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wdwREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ed Ruscha: Then & Now","description":"A collection of photographic prints documenting Hollywood Boulevard first in July 1973 and later in June 2004.

When his friend, the Indiana-born artist Franklin Booth, approached him with the idea of driving from New York to Indiana, Dreiser's response to Booth was immediate: \\"All my life I've been thinking of making a return trip to Indiana and writing a book about it\\". So was born the literary genre -- the American automobile road book. Along the route, Dreiser recorded his impressions of the people and land in words while his traveling companion sketched some of these scenes. In this reflective tale, Dreiser and Booth cross four states, covering 2,000 miles in two weeks, to arrive at Indiana and the sites and memories of Dreiser's early life in Terre Haute, Sullivan, Evansville, Warsaw, and his year at Indiana University.

Translations are accompanied by introductory and explanatory material and each volume includes a comprehensive guide to the sources' interpretation, including discussion of critical linguistic problems and an assessment of recent research on the topics covered. From 1348 to 1350 Europe was devastated by an epidemic that left between a third and one half of the population dead. This source book traces, through contemporary writings, the calamitous impact of the Black Death in Europe, with a particular emphasis on its spread across England from 1348 to 1349. Rosemary Horrox surveys contemporary attempts to explain the plague, which was universally regarded as an expression of divine vengeance for the sins of humankind. Moralists all had their particular targets for criticism. However, this emphasis on divine chastisement did not preclude attempts to explain the plague in medical or scientific terms. Also, there was a widespread belief that human agencies had been involved, and such scapegoats as foreigners, the poor and Jews were all accused of poisoning wells. The final section of the book charts the social and psychological impact of the plague, and its effect on the late-medieval economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J28CEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bella Cosa: Pocket Watches (The Bella Cosa Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CmZQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Bella+Cosa:+Pocket+Watches+(The+Bella+Cosa+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Garden","description":"\\"One of th' gardens is locked up.

Rich with insights and perceptions of the obscurity and  unknowability  of God, this work reveals God as being on an entirely different plane of existence from human beings so different that time-bound human language is inadequate to describe God exhaustively or accurately. Intellect and emotion both fail in seeking God, who can only be encountered by rejecting all common earthly means in a  cloud of forgetting  and the discovery of Godself in the dark  cloud of unknowing  that can be pierced only with a  lance of longing love.  Now, we finally have a translation that captures all of this beauty and complexity, without minimizing the nuances, all of which are explained with extensive introductions and accompanying notes. \\"If I could keep with me only two books and a journal, this book would be one of the books.

She can see it coming down the street. You don't stop and hug her and tell her you love her. You don't thank her for being a good, kind, patient mother. Of course not--you launch yourself down the stairs and make a run for the corner. Only, if it's the last time you'll ever see your mother, you sort of start to wish you'd stopped and did those things. Maybe even missed the bus. But the bus was barreling down our street, so I ran. Fourteen kids. One superstore. A million things that go wrong. In Emmy Laybourne's action-packed debut novel Monument 14, six high school kids (some popular, some not), two eighth graders (one a tech genius), and six little kids trapped together in a chain superstore build a refuge for themselves inside. While outside, a series of escalating disasters, beginning with a monster hailstorm and ending with a chemical weapons spill, seems to be tearing the world--as they know it--apart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vkGoMgEACAAJ&dq=Monument&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curious George's Are You Curious?","description":"Do you ever feel like George?

More than 20,000 students have successfully learned ocean navigation from these materials and gone on to cross oceans or circumnavigate the globe. This book covers how to find position at sea from timed sextant sights of the sun, moon, stars, and planets plus other routine and special procedures of safe, efficient offshore navigation. No previous navigation experience is required. The only math involved is arithmetic (adding and subtracting angles and times). This is a practical, how-to-do-it book, which also includes clear explanations of how it works and how to do it well. Plus this book includes other crucial factors of ocean navigation besides just finding out where you are from the stars, such as logbook procedures, dead reckoning, error analysis, route planning, and more. At the end of this book, you will be ready for ocean navigation. The book includes: text, practice problems, tables selections, detailed glossary, and full solutions. Printable work forms, plotting sheets, and other resources are available at no charge from www.starpath.com/celnavbook. Preface to the Second Edition. We are pleased to say that after ten more years of using this text we do not find reason to change the basic approach and methods of the teaching. We still use most of the same examples, which are now quite old, but that is the beauty of celestial navigation. It has not changed, so we do not benefit in any way from making all new examples, which would bring with them more chance of error in a book of many numbers. We have, however, notably improved and expanded the book. Each section has been updated and reformatted for a clearer presentation, often in response to student questions over the years. New graphics have been added and older ones all updated. There is much new content in the text, especially in the In-Depth chapter, including more detailed discussion of the sailings and more background on the principles. New sections were added on general ocean navigation and optimizing the fixes. We have also updated the electronic navigation section, as most ocean navigators will also be using other tools besides celestial.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZBOrgEACAAJ&dq=Celestial+Navigation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soup City Bars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y7TrPAAACAAJ&dq=Soup+City+Bars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perspectives on Contemporary Literature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vq8bmgEACAAJ&dq=Perspectives+on+Contemporary+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The soft machine","description":"In Naked Lunch, William S.

For centuries, Sufi thinkers have been linked to both religions in certain important ideas. But, like the elephant in the dark in Jalaludin Rumi's classic fable, these ideas are not grasped in full by seizing parts of the whole and arguing for or against their supposed Christian or Islamic derivation.

In this book, scientist-theologian John Polkinghorne changes the discussion. He approaches the dialogue from a little-explored perspective in which theology shapes the argument and sets the agenda of questions to be considered. The author begins with a review of approaches to science and religion in which the classification focuses on theological content rather than on methodological technique. He then proceeds with chapters discussing the role of Scripture, a theology of nature, the doctrine of God, sacramental theology, and eschatology. Throughout, Polkinghorne takes the perspective of Trinitarian thinking while arguing in a style that reflects the influence of his career as a theoretical physicist. In the final chapter, the author defends the appropriateness of addressing issues of science and religion from the specific standpoint of his Christian belief. His book provides an important model for theologians and scientists alike, showing how their two fields can inform one another in significant ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=87kIo6Rhq9YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Jeffries Dusts for Clues (Victorian Mystery Ser.)","description":"This charming series of Victorian murder mysteries features mild-mannered Inspector Witherspoon of Scotland Yard and, more importantly, Mrs Jeffries, his housekeeper.

A. Brannen Series)","description":"\\"When America declared war in 1917, I was a few months past eighteen years of age and just finishing my first year in college. By the time I was to reenter in the fall for the second year, war activities were [under way] on a large scale. Men were going into some branch of the service on all sides. I felt that my family should do their bit in uniform, and my age designated me as the most appropriate one.\\" This Texas A&M College student was Carl Andrew Brannen; these are his memoirs of a time when boys became men and your country became your life. Over There: A Marine in the Great War takes the reader on an almost two-year journey through his world as a young soldier in the war. Based on Brannen's memoirs recorded in the 1930s and photographs he took with a German camera as a soldier, this book describes day-to-day obstacles he and his fellow soldiers faced during Marine Corps training, movement to France, and mortal combat. \\"As I jumped for protection into a ditch nearby, a fusillade of bullets caught me below the heart on the left side, through one lens of the field glasses, and against my bandoleer of ammunition. The best I remember, ten bullets in my own belt exploded, but they had deflected the enemy bullets, saving my life.\\" Brannen, though wounded in battle and in the hospital for three weeks, went on with 80th Company through the Meuse-Argonne campaign to the armistice on November 11. He pulled his months of duty in the occupation of the Rhineland and, at its end, earned a place in the Composite Regiment of men selected to represent the American Expeditionary Forces in the many ceremonial events of 1919. Complemented with a unique set of photographs by the author's son that retrace his father's military campaigns, Over There is a highly personal account, presented from an enlisted man's perspective of the battle fronts of Belleau Woods in the Chateau-Thierry sector, Soissons, Pont-a-Mousson, St. Mihiel, Blanc Mont Ridge, and the Meuse-Argonne battle. As a first hand commentary and a social document of life in the trenches during World War I, it is a useful contribution to military history.
