This is a book that raises a multitude of awkward questions -- and provides some uncomfortably plausible answers. In 1943, a very gifted man with a deep hatred of everything British comes to an important decision. 'If conventional armed forces cannot conquer this blot on the face of Europe then we must learn from the ancient Greek legend of the Trojan horse and destroy it from within its own borders.' Even as World War II was ending this man and his disciples were infiltrating Britain and, with extraordinary ability and vision, began to change its economy and culture. Their skill in the now commonly used misinformation techniques can be taken from the fact that their ability to manipulate the media was unsurpassed and yet the media owners and operators were only vaguely aware of their existence. This is an incredible story of hatred and love of Britain as a nation state. It is the story of a foot soldier in a new type of war - a war waged in secret, over many years, and with incalculable effect. This young man is one of many trained since his pre-teen years to damage the British economy and way of life through the use of misinformation techniques. As he struggles to fulfil the destiny that others have intended for him, he begins to question the certainties he has been given and, finally, to come to a momentous conclusion. His true destiny lies elsewhere. In recent times whenever British people of mature years get together in groups the conversation invariably turns at some stage to the depressing changes that have taken place in the country since World War II. In particular, they ask each other why British governments never follow the wishes of the majority on key issues like law and order, our relationship with Europe and preventing dangerous terrorists from setting up their operations in Britain. The typical reaction of those who have read this is -- 'If there is a better explanation for the current situation in Britain, then I have not yet heard of it!'","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LbyDNbMhb0QC&dq=THE+TROJAN+HEARSE.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","description":"The well-known mystery author presents one of her most famous sleuths, the inimitable Miss Marple, as she follows the trail of a murderer who seems to be very fond of nursery rhymes.

More than public relations posturing or kowtowing to political correctness, social responsibility in corporations is proving essential to the long-term success of companies in today's globalized economy. Businesses must now contend with a globalized public that is increasingly aware of business' obligations to society and expects a level of accountability that most companies cannot meet. Good companies must go beyond merely being good-they must have integrity and a strategy aligned with it. Integrity in business has traditionally meant being honest, upright, and ethical, but in response to globalization, companies are being forced to move beyond this definition and add to it another fundamental quality-integration with society. Corporations must anticipate and respond directly to the demands of public opinion rather than waiting for government intervention, mediation, and regulation to force them into action. When Good Companies Do Bad Things explores the strategic relationship between know-how, integrity, and integration, demonstrating how companies that fail to embrace the deeper meanings of these terms jeopardize their reputations and future prosperity. The notion of corporations taking on social issues for the greater good is gaining momentum, not only because of political correctness but because it can strengthen a company's long-term strategy. Peter Schwartz and Blair Gibb examine well-known cases of companies like Shell, Nike, Texaco, and Nestl?, illustrating the huge financial risks of corporate assumptions that lead many companies to make poor choices. When Good Companies Do Bad Things explores the strategic relationship between know-how and integrity, demonstrating how companies that do not embrace the deeper meanings of these terms can jeopardize their own reputations and future prosperity. The authors present new approaches that demonstrate how it is possible to translate social value into business value. Peter Schwartz, author of The Art of the Long View, and Blair Gibb recount well-known cases of companies like Shell, Nike, Texaco, and Nestl?, companies that found themselves facing accusations of hazardous environmental practices, racism in the workplace, and human rights violations. To themselves and the corporate world they were each considered good companies, until they were blindsided by issues on which large segments of the public felt that their trust had been violated. Schwartz and Gibb present new approaches to avoid the financial pitfalls of bad corporate assumptions and enable good companies to make good on translating social value into business value.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Id7tAAAAMAAJ&dq=When+Good+Companies+Do+Bad+Things:+Responsibility+and+Risk+in+an+Age+of+Globalization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh!

In 1901 Andrew Gennett put all of his money into a tract of timber along the Chattooga River watershed, which traverses parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. By the time he wrote his memoir almost forty years later, Gennett had outwitted and outworked countless competitors in the southern mountains to make his mark as one of the region's most seasoned, innovative, and successful lumbermen. His recollections of a rough-and-ready outdoors life are filled with details of logging, from the first \\"cruise\\" of a timber stand to the moment when the last board lies \\"on sticks\\" in the mill yard. He tells how massive poplars, oaks, and other hardwoods had to be felled and trimmed by hand, dragged down mountain slopes by draft animals, floated downstream or carried by rail to the mill, and then sawn, graded, and stacked for drying. He tells of buying timber rights in a land market filled with \\"sharp\\" operators, where titles and surveys were often contested and kinship and custom were on an equal footing with the law. Gennett saw more than potential \\"boardfeet\\" when he looked at a tree. He recalls, for instance, his efforts to convince the U.S. Forest Service to purchase undisturbed areas of wilderness at a time when its mandate was to condemn and buy up farmed-out and clear-cut land. One such sale initiated by Gennett would become the Joyce Kilmer Wilderness in North Carolina. Filled with logging lore and portraits of the southern mountains and their people, Sound Wormy adds an absorbing new chapter to the region's natural and environmental history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5arHjMc2-xcC&dq=Sound+Wormy:+Memoir+of+Andrew+Gennett,+Lumberman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of William the Conqueror (Biographical histories)","description":"A complete biography of William I, well-known as William the Conquerer, this volume features chapters on his early life, invasions, marriage and the Battle of Hastings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YmoBAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Things My Geeky-Jock-of-a-Best Friend Must Do in Europe","description":"Brady is going to Europe with her mother!

Managers are introduced to thirteen diverse workers who relate their remarkable life histories about being gay, bisexual, and heterosexual in the workplace. They are then shown how sexual orientation impacts workplace productivity and how a welcoming and inclusive work environment results in positive performance. To initiate the inclusive environment, managers are provided with methods and techniques proven successful in workplaces throughout America and the world. Bob Powers and Alan Ellis offer clear guidelines to select diversity-sensitive employees, define their responsibilities in the workplace, set performance expectations, provide feedback and recognition, and reward success to cultivate the inclusive work environment. As workers shift their energies away from \\"hiding\\" their sexual orientation, workplace productivity increases to achieve and exceed goals and objectives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JmrW5l1xov0C&dq=A+Manager%27s+Guide+to+Sexual+Orientation+in+the+Workplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Excursions in geometry","description":"A straightedge, compass, and a little thought are all that's needed to discover the intellectual excitement of geometry.

It will dramatically change our landscape, our environment, our economy, and our lives. It will provide each and every one of us with a truly unique sense of independence. It will mark the end of oil-influenced politics, and the beginning of a bright new millennium - a time in which we all will have our own unlimited sources of nonpolluting energy. However, it will not come without a struggle, as history has already shown. The Coming Energy Revolution provides us with an intriguing and insightful look at the forces behind the free-energy movement. The Coming Energy Revolution introduces us to some of the inventors, both past and present, who have insisted that we are surrounded by a sea of energy that we can tap once we have learned nature's secrets. Conventional science says that space is cold and still, and that what energy does exist cannot be put to useful work. The new-energy innovators say that conventional science is wrong, and that new-energy research is being suppressed by a combination of scientific inertia and corporate self-interest. But the suppression cannot last, as this book shows - there are simply too many inventors who are close to new-energy breakthroughs. The Coming Energy Revolution examines the technologies on which these inventors are working. There are magnets that can redirect the energy of space. There is a gentler form of nuclear energy that can take place on a table top. There is hydrogen, a clean, abundant fuel that can be produced wherever needed. There is a form of hydropower that does not rely on massive dams. And there are other forms of new energy. The Coming Energy Revolution looks at them all, and at the kinds of changes that will be needed to overcome the roadblocks between our old-energy present and our new-energy future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qQoKAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Energy+Revolution:+The+Search+for+Free+Energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Differential geometry","description":"An introductory textbook on the differential geometry of curves and surfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, presented in its simplest, most essential form.

Though men were attracted to her and women liked her company, their feelings were often ambivalent, as Alison s father, Chief Inspector Douglas Quantrill, and his clever young assistant, Martin Tait, both observed at a party celebrating Jasmine s latest novel. Her cousin, a failed playwright, resented her riches; her neighbour, intellectual television pundit Jonathan Elliott, despised her kind of fiction; his feminist wife Roz hated its old-fashioned message. Even Quantrill himself resented the fact that his wife was more roused by Jasmine s fictional heroes than by himself . . . So when Jasmine s body is discovered, one morning some months later, Quantrill and Tait set to work to interview those hostile friends; to trace valuable oriental ornaments missing from her disordered living-room; and through her former secretary Anne, now engaged to a local farmer, to learn about the men in Jasmine s life. But as he unravels these strands of the mystery, Quantrill is weighed down by the tangle of fear and concern he feels for his wife, and for his daughter. Against a beautiful and loving portrait of the Suffolk countryside Sheila Radley sets her absorbing story of mystery, love and violence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zhZOXnTi4lwC&dq=The+Chief+Inspector%27s+Daughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kentucky's Domain of Power, Greed and Corruption","description":"Referring to college athletics as amateur sports is as archaic as football s flying wedge that was outlawed almost a century ago. College athletics are all about multi-million-dollar programs, billion-dollar television contracts, corporate control and cronyism. Power greed and corruption have turned the top athletic programs into money-making machines controlled as much by people outside the program as university presidents and athletics directors. Few, if any, books written about college athletics closely examine the behind the scenes deal making, how lucrative contracts are awarded and the favored few who benefit. This book reveals how and why sports decisions were made at the University of Kentucky, one of the nation s top programs, how they were influenced by powerful elements who profited, sometimes by questionable legal and ethical tactics from these actions. Six years of solid academic research stands behind the facts revealed in this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rxXx7upoR1UC&dq=Kentucky%27s+Domain+of+Power,+Greed+and+Corruption&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Softdesk Civil: Using the Power of Softdesk","description":"A solid foundation in Softdesk Civil/Survey applications is yours with this new book!

In Burst of Flavor: The Fine Art of Cooking with Spices, Chef Cooray combines the foods of her South Asian childhood (spicy curries, fresh vegetables and fruits, curd, treacle) with her later discoveries as a culinary student in Europe (ripe cheeses, wine, crusty breads, creme fraiche) in new and imaginative ways. Throughout her diverse culinary education and experiences, Chef Cooray's love of spices and herbs never diminished. This compilation of more than 200 recipes showcases her bold use of fresh herbs and spices, from the familiar (nutmeg, fennel, saffron, basil) to the exotic (burnet, ajowan, mace, neem). Several dishes--a caviar and blini appetizer created for Rudolf Nureyev, a soup celebrating a visit by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis--are accompanied by lively anecdotes. Chef Cooray also provides some food history and serving suggestions-all written in her graceful and engaging style. Noted wine expert Richard Field contributes guidelines for wine selection and makes recommendations for ten specially selected recipes. A helpful glossary explains the characteristics and origin of the spices and herbs used in the recipes. Here is ample evidence of Chef Cooray's talent for creating exciting combinations of ingredients and flavors and for bringing out the best in each.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mZsBEAAAQBAJ&dq=Burst+of+Flavor:+The+Fine+Art+of+Cooking+With+Spices+(Latitude+20+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java Programming with Oracle JDBC","description":"JDBC is the key Java technology for relational database access. Oracle is arguably the most widely used relational database platform in the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation of JDBC. You begin by learning the all-important mysteries of establishing database connections. This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC's relational SQL features. You'll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you'll learn how to interface with Oracle's other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you're taking advantage of the Oracle's relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you'll be pleased with Don's thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You'll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC. Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar with. If you write Java programs to run against an Oracle database, this book is a must-have.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r13SMVABpx4C&dq=Java+Programming+with+Oracle+JDBC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Around the world with my red balloon,","description":"Two children tell of their dream to travel in their red balloon carrying the news of Jesus to the children of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZXYURAAACAAJ&dq=Around+the+world+with+my+red+balloon,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touching The Invisible","description":"Until we know how to recognize God s voice, we are unsure of His will, uncertain in our prayers, and ineffective in our Christian service.

Rozsika Parker uses household accounts, women's magazines, letters, novels and the works of art themselves to trace through history how the separation of the craft of embroidery from the fine arts came to be a major force in the marginalisation of women's work. Beautifully illustrated, her book also discusses the contradictory nature of women's experience of embroidery: how it has inculcated female subservience while providing an immensely pleasurable source of creativity, forging links between women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cdNNAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Subversive+Stitch:+Embroidery+and+the+Making+of+the+Feminine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morocco with Map (Insight Pocket Guide Morocco)","description":"Insight Guides Pocket Guide Morocco Travel made easy.

Prepare yourself for a spiritual revolution. In fact, this book is so powerful that because of it, in 1950 the Catholic Church had Samael Aun Weor jailed. They accused him of  offending the public and healing the ill.  The Perfect Matrimony is a complete introduction to the profound and beautiful mystical knowledge from which all the world s great religions have blossomed. There is a sacred teaching, the source of the secret teachings of Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Alchemy, Tantra, Kabbalah, and the mysteries of the Mayans, Aztecs, Egyptians, Tibetans, Eleusinians, Essenes, and hundreds more. All of them have a sexual secret. All of them came from the same root knowledge. The Perfect Matrimony explains how to solve the problem that originated with Adam and Eve: an event clearly rooted in sex. Jesus also taught how to solve this problem (his first miracle was at a wedding, after all), but the church edited his teachings. When Samael Aun Weor publicly revealed the true teachings, the outraged church had him imprisoned in an effort to repress what he revealed. Everything that lives was created through sex. Just the same, the soul is created through sex, but not the sex of the common person. To create divinity, one must understand divine sexuality. Such knowledge has always been preserved in secret, held safely for those who demonstrated their ability to use it properly. Now, for the first time in history, that knowledge has been revealed openly: this book, originally published in 1950, marked its first public appearance. \\"Love is the highest religion...  - Samael Aun Weor, The Perfect Matrimony (1950) With the explanations in this book, you will understand not only many seemingly vague and incomprehensible scriptures, but also how all genuine spiritual practices work. After reading this book, religion and sex make sense. Moreover, you will see that religion is not found in organizations, buildings, or books, it is found in the heart that is enflamed with divine love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ue_7AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nursing Management Secrets, 1e","description":"This book provides a basic overview of key areas that a nurse manager needs to know in order to manage effectively.

How do billions of neurons bring about ideas, sensations, emotions, and actions? Why do children learn faster than elderly people? What can go wrong in perception, thinking, learning, and acting? Scientists now use computer models to help us to understand the most private and human experiences. In The Mind Within the Net, Manfred Spitzer shows how these models can fundamentally change how we think about learning, creativity, thinking, and acting, as well as such matters as schools, retirement homes, politics, and mental disorders. Neurophysiology has told us a lot about how neurons work; neural network theory is about how neurons work together to process information. In this highly readable book, Spitzer provides a basic, nonmathematical introduction to neural networks and their clinical applications. Part I explains the fundamental theory of neural networks and how neural network models work. Part II covers the principles of network functioning and how computer simulations of neural networks have profound consequences for our understanding of how the brain works. Part III covers applications of network models (e.g., to knowledge representation, language, and mental disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease) that shed new light on normal and abnormal states of mind. Finally, Spitzer concludes with his thoughts on the ramifications of neural networks for the understanding of neuropsychology and human nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lniTl1DbRX4C&dq=The+Mind+within+the+Net:+Models+of+Learning,+Thinking,+and+Acting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Braunfels, Comal County, Texas: A Pictorial History","description":"This book strives to give a glimpse into the past of New Braunfels and its environs through priceless pictures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6X4nAAAACAAJ&dq=New+Braunfels,+Comal+County,+Texas:+A+Pictorial+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bernard Berenson treasury;: A selection from the works, unpublished writings, letters, diaries, and journals of the most celebrated humanist and art historian of our times, 1887-1958","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z7efAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Bernard+Berenson+treasury%3B:+A+selection+from+the+works,+unpublished+writings,+letters,+diaries,+and+journals+of+the+most+celebrated+humanist+and+art+historian+of+our+times,+1887-1958&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reelin' and Rockin': The Golden Age of American Rock 'N Roll 1956-1959 (Rock & Roll Reference Series)","description":"Lee Cotten's Shake, Rattle & Roll: The Golden Age of American Rock 'n Roll, Volume 1: 1952-1956 (1989), marked the beginning of a journey back to the very roots of rock 'n roll, a pilgrimage to a time filled with the names and matchless music of legendary rhythm and blues performers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZSHaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reelin%27+and+Rockin%27:+The+Golden+Age+of+American+Rock+%27N+Roll+1956-1959+(Rock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of the Hunter","description":"In this moving sequel to The Lost World of the Kalahari van der Post records everything he has learned of the life and lore of Africa's first inhabitants.

TreviDo s decision to write a collection of short stories arose from his frustration over years Hollywood rejecting his film projects with Hispanic characters and themes. Rather than give up, he channeled his energy into these short stories. Through his interconnected stories, TreviDo gives us an off-beat, magically real and at times raucous vision of life in the barrios of Arroyo Grande, Texas. Ever the observer of the tragicomic human scene, TreviDo recreates for the reader the world of adults as overheard and filtered through the understanding of the young. Each adult action creates a wave of repercussions for the children, be it love triangles, petty jealousies or revenge. The rich texture of the narrative and the rich diversity of Hispanic characters all come to a romping, feverish end with a fantasy that features an army of movie stereotypes of Hispanics who have returned as zombies bent on avenging themselves on Hollywood directors and screenwriters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RtqnMWMx_6YC&dq=The+Fabulous+Sinkhole+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy","description":"By the winner of the John Burroughs Medal for nature writing  Gary Nabhan went to walk in old Italy like a pilgrim. . . .

As with the earlier series the present surveys purport to give a survey of significant trends in contemporary philosophical discussion. The need for such surveys has, I believe, increased rather than decreased over the last years. The philosophical scene appears, for various reasons, rather more complex than ever before. The continuing process of specialization in most branches, the emergence of new schools of thought, particularly in philosophical logic in the philosophy of language, and in social and political philosophy, the increasing attention being paid to the history of philosophy in discussions of contem porary problems as well as the increasing interest in cross-cultural philosophical discussion, are the most important contributory factors. Surveys of the present kind are a valuable source of knowledge about this complexity and may as such be of assistance in renewing the understanding of one's own philosophical problems. The surveys, it is to be hoped, may help to strengthen the Socratic element of modern philosophy, the world wide dialogue or Kommunikationsgemeinschaft. So far, six volumes have been prepared for the new series. The present surveys in Asian Philosophy (Vol. 7) follow the surveys in the Philosophy of Language and Philosophical Logic (Vol. I), Philosophy of Science (Vol. 2), Philosophy of Action (Vol. 3), Philosophy of Mind (Vol. 4), African Philosophy (Vol. 5), and Medieval Philosophy Part 1-2 (Vol. 6).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uDHyCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Musical Is Man? (Jessie & John Danz Lectures)","description":"This important study in ethnomusicology is an attempt by the author -- a musician who has become a social anthropologist -- to compare his experiences of music-making in different cultures. He is here presenting new information resulting from his research into African music, especially among the Venda. Venda music, he discovered is in its way no less complex in structure than European music. Literacy and the invention of nation may generate extended musical structures, but they express differences of degree, and not the difference in kind that is implied by the distinction between 'art' and 'folk' music. Many, if not all, of music's essential processes may be found in the constitution of the human body and in patterns of interaction of human bodies in society. Thus all music is structurally, as well as functionally, 'folk' music in the sense that music cannot be transmitted of have meaning without associations between people. If John Blacking's guess about the biological and social origins of music is correct, or even only partly correct, it would generate new ideas about the nature of musicality, the role of music in education and its general role in societies which (like the Venda in the context of their traditional economy) will have more leisure time as automation increases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yqR6uASK2C0C&dq=How+Musical+Is+Man%3F+(Jessie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of Stones","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YC_iAAAAMAAJ&dq=Heart+of+Stones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Partisans (Ulverscroft Large Print Series: Adventure, Suspense)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0CngAAAAMAAJ&dq=Partisans+(Ulverscroft+Large+Print+Series:+Adventure,+Suspense)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skeletons (Pocket Guides)","description":"The Pocket-sized Reference Book Series Each book covers a subject from science, nature, history and art.

For almost forty years, Dean Smith coached the University of North Carolina men's basketball program with unsurpassed success- on the court and in shaping young men's lives. In his long-awaited memoir, he reflects on the great games, teams, players, strategies, and rivalries that defined his career, and explains the philosophy that guided him. There's a lot more to life than basketball- though some may beg to differ- but there's a lot more to basketball than basketball, and this is a book about basketball filled with wisdom about life. Dean Smith insisted that the fundamentals of good basketball were the fundamentals of character- passion, discipline, focus, selflessness, and responsibility- and he strove to unite his teams in pursuit of those values. To read this book is to understand why Dean Smith changed the lives of the players he coached, from Michael Jordan, who calls him his second father and who never played a single NBA game without wearing a pair of UNC basketball shorts under his uniform, to the last man on the bench of his least talented team. We all wish we had a coach like Dean Smith in our lives, and now we will have that chance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w3zrZQ3yYyIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Father Coughlin's Radio Discourses, 1931-1932","description":"Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891-1979) was a controversial Roman Catholic priest was one of the first political leaders to use radio to reach a mass audience.

This is a largely untold history that needs to be unpacked. This book brings to light some of the events leading towards interdisciplinary relations in archaeology from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. It encompasses ten scholarly contributions that offer a critical overview of this complex, dynamic and long-lasting transformative process. This is a pioneering project in the field of the history of archaeology, as it is the first to examine the inclusion into archaeological practice of various disciplines categorized under the umbrella of hard, natural and social sciences, as well as the humanities. The authors of this volume include internationally acknowledged scholars of the history of archaeology, such as Margarita D az-Andreu, Nathan Schlanger and Oscar Moro, as well as other well-established authors in the field from Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Switzerland. The chapters cover a wide range of topics. Several of them deal with interdisciplinarity in archaeology on a more general level by analysing its relationship with other sciences in specific countries. Other chapters discuss the incorporation of disciplines such as palynology and zoology into archaeology, either on a wider scale or using certain countries as case studies. Some authors focus on the work of scholars as starting points for examining the intersection between antiquarianism, archaeology, the natural sciences and numismatics, while others theorize on the influence of epistemology and philosophy of science on archaeological theory and practice. Finally, the influence of the army is also discussed in the development of archaeology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fv0hEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Magyar+Venus+(Archaeological+Mysteries,+No.+8)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of Persian cooking","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-4g1PwAACAAJ&dq=The+art+of+Persian+cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Here Comes Ishmael: The Kairos Moment for the Muslim People","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1aE0zwEACAAJ&dq=Here+Comes+Ishmael:+The+Kairos+Moment+for+the+Muslim+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Browning, (English men of letters)","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

It remains the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States. When author Shirley Rosen first heard the news, her immediate thoughts were of her 83-year-old uncle, Harry Truman, who owned the 50-acre Mt. St. Helens Lodge resort on the shores of Spirit Lake. Harry was his given name, but if anyone asked he'd say, \\"Just call me Truman.\\" Drawing from interviews and memories of working at Truman's lodge, Shirley Rosen tells the story of this salty curmudgeon who became an American folk hero during the eruption of Mount St. Helens. When the mountain gave warnings of impending danger, Truman defiantly refused to leave his home of 55 years. His rugged independence, hard-nosed business sense, and infectious humor embodied the spirit of the nation, capturing its attention and its heart. In the end, the mountain he loved had the final word.

The Worldly Philosophers not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines. In a bold new concluding chapter entitled  The End of the Worldly Philosophy?  Heilbroner reminds us that the word  end  refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today s increasingly  scientific  economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vIxtW9cw-DQC&dq=The+Worldly+Philosophers.+The+Lives,+Times+and+Ideas+of+the+Great+Economic+Thinkers.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remembering to Live","description":"Sasaks, a people of the Indonesian archipelago, cope with one of the country's worst health records by employing various medical traditions, including their own secret ethnomedical knowledge.

For decades, HP was admired not only for its innovative products and soaring stock price, but for its egalitarian corporate culture and father-knows-best integrity. Backfire explains how the company fell on hard times, recounts the historic decision that made Fiorina the world's top-ranking female executive, and brings to life the backlash that resulted when she tried to impose her charismatic salesmanship on the aging icon. Top BusinessWeek journalist Peter Burrows gives the dramatic blow-by-blow of Hewlett's effort to kill Fiorina's most controversial move of all, her $19 billion purchase of rival Compaq Computer. Fiorina won by a whisker, after the most expensive proxy fight in history and a dramatic lawsuit that accused the company of illegally fixing the vote.

Little is known of the thousands who leave, frustrated, anguished, confused. For them there are no trumpets of glory, no energized fanfare. No one knows fundamentalism like a fundamentalist, and no one can express what it means to struggle with one's faith to the breaking point, like an ex-fundamentalist. After presenting a fascinating history of \\"Fundamentalism's Grotesque Past,\\" this riveting new collection offers testimonies of former fundamentalists who became so disillusioned with their church that they chose to leave. Presenting more than thirty personal journeys, this book gives a clear picture of what attracts a person to the fundamentalist faith and what can drive believers away from their religion. Leaving the Fold includes the religious odysseys of those who left fundamentalism behind in favor of atheism or agnosticism, as well as the spiritual journeys of those who remained Christians but backed away from the powerful attraction of fundamentalism. These testimonies convey not only deep feelings and penetrating facts, but the appeal of dogmatic fundamentalism and each individual's struggle to maintain their faith. Leaving the Fold discusses the fears and dilemmas faced by each person who chose to part ways with the church, their gradual dawning of courage to continue asking questions, and their success in giving their intellectual curiosity the freedom it craves. Christians, atheists, and those who may be questioning their own religious convictions will find Leaving the Fold engrossing.

God answered no. Three times St. Paul begged God to remove the \\"thorn from his side.\\" Three times God said no. When, says Father Lanahan, my family prayed desperately for my brother Neil to be cured of melanoma, God said no. When we prayed for a twenty-five-year-old niece to survive a car accident, God said no. When the victims of war in the former Yugoslavia, or in any of the hundred places war is being waged at any given time prayed; when people afflicted with cancer, alcoholism, or AIDS prayed for deliverance; when the victims of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse prayed to be spared, the answer was \\"No.\\" This book is not another theological or philosophical attempt to provide a rational solution to the divine puzzle of why God allows innocent people to suffer or why our prayers in Jesus' name are not effective. This book attempts to provide simple, practical, pastoral insights for the ordinary person who comes to listen to the Word of God when we assemble as Church. When God Says No ends in Heaven. Face to face with God, says Father Lanahan, we will not be given the answer to the question that no theology, no book, not even the Bible, no dogma, no authority, not even that of the Church, has ever answered: Why the suffering of the innocent? Instead, we will be blessed with the fullness of salvation and healing and made whole at last.

Seven young people, most of them foreigners backpacking around Australia, brutally murdered, their remains uncovered in 1992 and 1993. It would take scores of police over three years, countless hours of forensic investigation, thousands of false leads and a few precious clues to charge and convict Ivan Milat for their horrific deaths. Sins of the Brother is the definitive work on Ivan Milat, his family and the murders. Almost four years in the making, informed by exclusive interviews with members of the Milat family, key police investigators and Crown lawyers, this book reveals a family culture so bizarre it would lead inexorably to murder. It also scrutinises the police investigation-its remarkable success and failures, the dramatic turning point and the backbiting and bitterness that followed Milat's arrest. Thought-provoking, totally unsalacious, an exploration of the darker side of Australian life as a whole, Sins of the Brother is a detailed and gripping read-a psychological thriller come to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=acfCYGPaqCoC&dq=Sins+of+the+brother:+The+definitive+story+of+Ivan+Milat+and+the+backpacker+murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With No Fear Of Failure","description":"Candid conversations with top leaders around the world on how they approached pitvotal moments in their careers No Fear of Failure offers insightful, candid conversations with some of the world's top leaders in business, politics, education, and philanthropy each giving a first-person account of how they approached crucial, career defining moments.

In so doing, he tells the story of a broken promiseGod s ancient covenant with Israeland of its strange, unlooked-for fulfillment. For, having abandoned his chosen people to an impending holocaust at the hands of their Roman conquerors. God, in the person of Jesus, chooses to die with them, in what is effectively an act of divine suicide. On the basis of this shocking argument, Miles compels us to reassess Christ s entire life and teaching: His proclivity for the powerless and disgraced. His refusal to discriminate between friends and enemies. His transformation of defeat into a victory that redeems not just Israel but the entire world. Combining a close reading of the Gospels with a range of reference that includes Donne, Nietzche, and Elie Wiesel, Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God is a work of magnificent eloquence and imagination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jv7oztyAMDYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"602 Reasons to Be Ticked Off","description":"Don't you hate it when you tell some ignoramus you're from a certain city and they say, \\"Oh, do you know my friend Henry?\\" Or, lousy gift givers who say, \\"I kept the receipt, if you want to return it,\\" so instead of a gift you end up with an extra errand?

Miriam Beckstein is happy in her life. She's a successful reporter for a hi-tech magazine in Boston, making good money doing what she loves. When her researcher brings her iron-clad evidence of a money-laundering scheme, Miriam thinks she's found the story of the year. But when she takes it to her editor, she's fired on the spot and gets a death threat from the criminals she has uncovered. Before the day is over, she's received a locket left by the mother she never knew-the mother who was murdered when she was an infant. Within is a knotwork pattern, which has a hypnotic effect on her. Before she knows it, she's transported herself to a parallel Earth, a world where knights on horseback chase their prey with automatic weapons, and where world-skipping assassins lurk just on the other side of reality - a world where her true family runs things. The six families of the Clan rule the kingdom of Gruinmarkt from behind the scenes, a mixture of nobility and criminal conspirators whose power to walk between the worlds makes them rich in both. Braids of family loyalty and intermarriage provide a fragile guarantee of peace, but a recently-ended civil war has left the families shaken and suspicious. Taken in by her mother's people, she becomes the star of the story of the century-as Cinderella without a fairy godmother. As her mother's heir, Miriam is hailed as the prodigal countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth, and feted and feasted. Caught up in schemes and plots centuries in the making, Miriam is surrounded by unlikely allies, forbidden loves, lethal contraband, and, most dangerous of all, her family. Her unexpected return will supercede the claims of other clan members to her mother's fortune and power, and whoever killed her mother will be happy to see her dead, too. Behind all this lie deeper secrets still, which threaten everyone and everything she has ever known. Patterns of deception and interlocking lies, as intricate as the knotwork between the universes. But Miriam is no one's pawn, and is determined to conquer her new home on her own terms. Blending the creativity and humor of Roger Zelazny, the adventure of H. Beam Piper and Philip Jose Farmer, and the rigor and scope of a science-fiction writer on the grandest scale, Charles Stross has set a new standard for fantasy epics.

Though its significance declined with the rise of chemistry, the lore of alchemy still colors imaginative works in the modern world. This study examines the literary representation of alchemical theory and the metaphor of alchemical regeneration in the works of Edward Taylor, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret Fuller. While Taylor used alchemical metaphors to illustrate the redeeming power of God's grace, Poe used them to represent the transforming power of imagination. Hawthorne, in turn, used alchemical imagery to show the restorative power of love, while Fuller employed alchemical figures to suggest the reconciliation of gender opposites.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MMplAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Marriage+of+Heaven+and+Earth:+Alchemical+Regeneration+in+the+Works+of+Taylor,+Poe,+Hawthorne,+and+Fuller+(Contributions+to+the+Study+of+American+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carnal Knowledge: A Navel Gazer's Dictionary of Anatomy, Etymology, and Trivia","description":"From head to toe to breast to behind, Charles Hodgson's Carnal Knowledge is a delightfully intoxicating tour of the words we use to describe our bodies.

They remember him as a monster: the devil who destroyed a sun, casually annihilating four billion human lives even the Emperor himself against Imperial orders. But Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier. On the wrong planet, at the right time, for the best reasons, Hadrian Marlowe starts down a path that can only end in fire. He flees his father and a future as a torturer only to be left stranded on a strange, backwater world. Forced to fight as a gladiator and navigate the intrigues of a foreign planetary court, Hadrian must fight a war he did not start, for an Empire he does not love, against an enemy he will never understand.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A-I4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","description":"The World Fantasy Award winner by the author of the Hyperion Cantos and Carrion Comfort: An American finds himself encircled by horrors in Calcutta.

There, alone except for his pet raven, Jack, he rediscovers the meaning of peace and quiet and harmony with nature of days spent not filling out forms, but tracking deer, or listening to the sound of a moth's wings.Throughout this year when  the subtle matters and the spectacular distracts,  Heinrich brings us back to the drama in small things, when life is lived consciously.

(2000 AACTE Outstanding Dissertation Award ... An article from: Journal of Teacher Education","description":"Waarom worden intellectuelen tegenwoordig gezien als wereldvreemde wezens, die een verwerpelijk elitaire levenshouding verdedigen? In zijn provocatieve Waar zijn de intellectuelen? hekelt Frank Furedi het anti-intellectuele klimaat dat heerst in het onderwijs, aan de universiteiten, in de media en bij de meeste culturele instellingen. In het tijdperk van de kenniseconomie zijn we er op de een of andere manier in geslaagd de groeiende participatie in het hoger onderwijs hand in hand te laten gaan met een toenemend cultureel analfabetisme. We leven in een cultuur van lage eisen en verwachtingen, en dat is funest, want in plaats van mensen te stimuleren houdt het ze dom. In dit belangrijke en meeslepende boek laat Furedi overtuigend zien dat niet de intellectuelen elitair zijn, maar degenen die hen bestrijden. Hun impliciete pessimisme over het vermogen om te leren en kennis te verwerven is een vorm van omgekeerd snobisme dat leidt tot een steeds dommere samenleving. Frank Furedi is hoogleraar sociologie aan de universiteit van Kent. Hij schreef eerder onder meer Culture of Fear, Paranoid Parenting en Therapy Culture. 'Furedi's verkwikkende en scherpe boek houdt zich bezig met een ongemeen belangrijk vraagstuk.' THEODORE DALRYMPLE IN THE SPECTATOR 'De kracht van het boek ligt in Furedi's talent om onverwachte verbanden te leggen, en het ene sociale verschijnsel te gebruiken om licht te werpen op een ander.'

Attraverso le storie intrecciate dei protagonisti, la citt  a cavallo tra i Ruggenti anni Venti e la mitica Et  del Jazz appare in fervente trasformazione, complicata, fuori controllo. Da Wall Street al lungomare, dalla Bowery al Village, dai grandi viali della citt  ai suoi vicoli grintosi, i suoi ricchi agenti di potere e i suoi immigrati in difficolt , questo romanzo caleidoscopico trasmette l energia inquieta della vita a Manhattan. Cos  le vite della bellissima e malinconica Ellen, dello sfortu- nato Stan, dell imprevedibile Congo Jake, dell acuto e sofferente Jimmy Herf, dell avvocato rampante George Baldwin e di molti altri si scontrano e si mescolano in questa metropoli frenetica e smorta al tempo stesso, in cui sembra impossibile essere vivi e felici e in cui do- mina, su tutto, l ossessione per il denaro e il successo. Pubblicato per la prima volta in Italia nel 1932, questo romanzo   poi stato a lungo ingiustamente dimenticato. Le innovative tecniche romanzesche utilizzate da Dos Passos  flashback, flusso di coscienza, inserzioni pubblicitarie e di notizie strillate dai giornali, per rendere la complessit  dell ambiente urbano  avrebbero ispirato una nuova scuola di scrittura.

The first half of this invaluable book contains a concise but relatively complete review of relevant topics in statistical mechanics and kinetic theory. It includes standard topics such as thermodynamics, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and ensemble theory. Special discussions include the dynamics of phase transitions, and Brownian motion as an illustration of stochastic processes. The second half develops topics in molecular biology and protein structure, with a view to discovering mechanisms underlying protein folding. Attention is focused on the energy flow through the protein in its folded state. A mathematical model, based on the Brownian motion of coupled harmonic oscillators, is worked out in the appendix.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JCr26KjbspkC&dq=Lectures+on+Statistical+Physics+and+Protein+Folding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","description":"Ever since George W. Bush began running for public office in the 1990s, questions have been raised in the public eye about his service in the Air National Guard during the late 1960s and early 1970s -- when countless American soldiers (John Kerry among them) were serving heroically in Vietnam. By the time of the presidential race in 2000, it was clear that Bush's record of service contained several troubling gaps -- especially in the period between May 1972 and May 1973, when Bush was supposed to have transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard. In early 2004, as the election season heated up, the White House bowed to pressure and released a host of documents related to Bush's service, promising that this disclosure would put the matter to rest. Yet the documents raised as many new questions as they answered. Now, for the first time, the comprehensive written record of George W. Bush's military career -- more than 250 pages in all -- is presented in book form. In his introduction and commentary, longtime activist and author Glenn W. Smith, the founder of Texans for Truth, highlights such questions as: How did Bush secure his acceptance into the National Guard, despite a long waiting list? Did his father pull strings, as some have alleged, to help him avoid the draft? Why did Bush suddenly stop performing his Guard service from mid-1972 to mid-1973, as the documents show? Did Bush truly perform sufficient duties to qualify for the honorable discharge he received, or was he given special consideration? In the summer of 1972, Bush failed to appear for his required physical, and was consequently suspended from flying. Why didn't he take the physical? And why has he claimed that he kept flying for the Guard? If Bush was present at the National Guard base in Montgomery, Alabama, during the disputed period, why has no one accepted the White House's pleas to step forward and confirm that he was there? And how do the now-discredited \\"Killian documents,\\" first aired on 60 Minutes in September 2004, affect our understanding of Bush's Guard status? Unfit Commander also tracks the Bush administration's efforts to defuse the controversy, from Bush's own claim that he \\"put in his time,\\" to the White House's record of unyielding non-denial denials despite the persistent questioning of the press. And at the heart of the book are the documents themselves: from Bush's agreement that \\"failure to satisfactorily complete [full] pilot training will result in my being discharged,\\" to his supervisor's statement that \\"Lt Bush has not been observed at this unit\\" during the critical period. A provocative exploration of this commander in chief's spotty record of personal military service, Unfit Commander is the place to start for anyone interested in getting at the truths of President Bush's character.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=owtLwMJatqMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Coins and Bills Are Made (Money Power)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5yRMAAAACAAJ&dq=How+Coins+and+Bills+Are+Made+(Money+Power)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working With Your Guides and Angels","description":"According to the author of this text, we often experience spirit contact in our lives but fail to recognize it for what it is.

It can tell us why the night is dark, what causes the tides, and even how best to catch a baseball. With In Praise of Simple Physics, popular math and science writer Paul Nahin presents a plethora of situations that explore the science and math behind the wonders of everyday life. Roaming through a diverse range of puzzles, he illustrates how physics shows us ways to wring more energy from renewable sources, to measure the gravity in our car garages, to figure out which of three light switches in the basement controls the light bulb in the attic, and much, much more. How fast can you travel from London to Paris? How do scientists calculate the energy of an atomic bomb explosion? How do you kick a football so it stays in the air and goes a long way downfield? Nahin begins with simpler problems and progresses to more challenging questions, and his entertaining, accessible, and scientifically and mathematically informed explanations are all punctuated by his trademark humor. Readers are presumed to have some background in beginning differential and integral calculus. Whether you simply have a personal interest in physics' influence in the world or you're an engineering and science student who wants to gain more physics know-how, this book has an intriguing scenario for you. In Praise of Simple Physics proves that if we look carefully at the world around us, physics has answers for the most astonishing day-to-day occurrences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CXOYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","description":"The final book in the New York Timesbestselling series is  a wacky, waggish whodunit,  as the Palm Beach PI investigates a dead end in a maze (Publishers Weekly).

However, his permanence is already sufficiently sure, and justifies the historical study of his international reception. The present collection of studies is an indispensable foundation for this.   Eric Hobsbawm, from the preface Antonio Gramsci is a giant of Marxian thought and one of the world's greatest cultural critics. Antonio A. Santucci is perhaps the world's preeminent Gramsci scholar. Monthly Review Press is proud to publish, for the first time in English, Santucci s masterful intellectual biography of the great Sardinian scholar and revolutionary. Gramscian terms such as  civil society  and  hegemony  are much used in everyday political discourse. Santucci warns us, however, that these words have been appropriated by both radicals and conservatives for contemporary and often self-serving ends that often have nothing to do with Gramsci s purposes in developing them. Rather what we must do, and what Santucci illustrates time and again in his dissection of Gramsci s writings, is absorb Gramsci s methods. These can be summed up as the suspicion of  grand explanatory schemes,  the unity of theory and practice, and a focus on the details of everyday life. With respect to the last of these, Joseph Buttigieg says in his Nota:  Gramsci did not set out to explain historical reality armed with some full-fledged concept, such as hegemony; rather, he examined the minutiae of concrete social, economic, cultural, and political relations as they are lived in by individuals in their specific historical circumstances and, gradually, he acquired an increasingly complex understanding of how hegemony operates in many diverse ways and under many aspects within the capillaries of society.  The rigor of Santucci s examination of Gramsci s life and work matches that of the seminal thought of the master himself. Readers will be enlightened and inspired by every page.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HZgUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Convergence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical mathematics: A concise history of the classical era in mathematics (Armor book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PdkGAQAAIAAJ&dq=Classical+mathematics:+A+concise+history+of+the+classical+era+in+mathematics+(Armor+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems and Prophecies","description":"Offers a selection of the poet's work, including all the lyrics and the important prophetic books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OBEeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Poems+and+Prophecies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Titanic (Cornerstones of Freedom)","description":"Dramatic and defining moments in American history come vividly the life in the Cornerstones of Freedom series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ozNVk1zXVegC&dq=The+Titanic+(Cornerstones+of+Freedom)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harlow, an intimate biography","description":"Harlow, An Intimate Biography, is the biography of Jean Harlow, the first of the typically American love goddesses as well as a presentation of the big-studio feudalism of the Thirties and a near sociological consideration of that American phenomenon, the sex symbol devised for mass consumption.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZPglPswSVPAC&dq=Harlow,+an+intimate+biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of England","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1m4KAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hit of the Party: The Complete Planner for Children's Theme Birthday Parties","description":"All projects offer simple, step-by-step instructions, easy-to-follow diagrams, time-saving tips and partyplanning guidelines.

With a series of important exhibitions recently showcasing his work, Caillebotte's enigmatic paintings have begun to exert an unexpected fascination for postmodern audiences, and they have become rich sites for interpretive debate. The essays that comprise this volume exemplify the best aspects of recent Caillebotte scholarship. They employ a variety of perspectives to examine the ways in which his art sheds light on the formation of individual and class identities in Paris during the early years of the Third Republic an era of transition marked by the burgeoning of capitalism and the instabilities of newly shifting gender roles in the modern world. Addressing a wide range of major paintings by Caillebotte, the contributors reveal the compound ways in which the artist encoded his images and the multiple interpretations to which these images are susceptible. Juxtaposed so as to complement and challenge one another, these essays build a provocative whole as they probe issues of spectatorship and authorial intention. The contributors all internationally known scholars and art professionals create an important theoretical framework for the discussion of Caillebotte's work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qH3HF2QXGVMC&dq=Gustave+Caillebotte+and+the+Fashioning+of+Identity+in+Impressionist+Paris&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to survival","description":"UITSLUITEND GESCHIKT VOOR IBOOKS Dit boeiende en alomvattende handboek is een onmisbare hulp om te kunnen overleven in de wildernis en in elk klimaat, op land of op zee, voor kampeerders, trekkers en zeilers en verder voor iedereen die zich bezighoudt met outdooractiviteiten.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MhMwAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Twilight : The Last Free Days of the Ute Indians","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MCh1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Red+Twilight+:+The+Last+Free+Days+of+the+Ute+Indians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Border Collie: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"Not an AKC-recognized breed, but beloved as one of the most intelligent dogs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_bwnOQAACAAJ&dq=The+Border+Collie:+An+Owner%27s+Guide+to+a+Happy+Healthy+Pet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Hope Vol 1","description":"The birth of a single mutant child changed the landscape of the X-Men's world.

Yes, you'll get all your burning and why-is-it-burning questions answered, but the advice is coming from a son-of-a-bitch with a breathtaking gift for the gratuitous insult. In these pages, you'll find medical answers to everything from how you can ejaculate farther to how you can take--ahem--more cargo on your loading dock. Alvear answers questions with the compassion of a caffeine addict out of coffee, lining up a panel of doctors and psychologists against the wall and beating the truth out of them. The result is a marriage of impeccably accurate information, politically incorrect opinion and withering sarcasm. Because the questions come from gay men all over the country, they're like a peephole into the anxieties, concerns and worries that gay men have about sex. Here's a sampling of what you'll learn: . . . Only 6% of the population need extra-large condoms. Get over it. . . . The average erect penis is 5. I\\" long and 4.8\\" around. Unless you're in a chat room. Then double it. . . . Kegel exercises will give you harder hard-ons and more powerful orgasms. But then, so will an 18-year-old. . . . 50% of men on anti-depressants experience sexual side effects. And no, having an affair is not considered a side effect you can blame on medicine. With buzz-saw wit, Men Are Pigs, But We Love Bacon will leave you laughing, howling, and knowing everything you need to know about sex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zVVwg_xkmZAC&dq=Men+Are+Pigs,+But+We+Love+Bacon:+Not-So-Straight+Answers+from+America%27s+Most+Outrageous+Gay+Sex+Columnist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Brown Notebook of Jane Eyer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SAgOPAAACAAJ&dq=Little+Brown+Notebook+of+Jane+Eyer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QDqPNgAACAAJ&dq=Art+For+Dummies+(For+Dummies+(Computer/Tech))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writer's Handbook of FAQs","description":"Fast answers to frequently asked questions about publishing--from preparing, submitting, and selling your manuscript, to industry etiquette, sales, and profitability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JjeGe9OU_LUC&dq=Writer%27s+Handbook+of+FAQs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of everyday things in England","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TBQ5AQAAMAAJ&dq=A+history+of+everyday+things+in+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fidel!: Castro's Political And Social Thought (Latin American Perspectives Series)","description":"\\"Little more than a hagiography from a prominent scholar, written from a less-than-critical perspective.

Investigating just that possibility, three amateur researchers have uncovered an historic mission artifact that, proven authentic, could shaken the golden state to its foundations. Nor would the repercussions end there, cautioned research director Brother Kolbe. Not by a long shot. At the state capitol in Sacramento, the governors Mission Affairs Department, and entrenched bereaucrazy representing the vested interest of the church, civic groups, university and private concerns, is naturally interested in the discovery. With real estate totaling in the multi-billion dollar range, including treasure troves of priceless relics and artwork, the Mission Affairs Department is somewhat hesitant at relinquishing control of their flock of iconic golden geese. Exposing the scandalous mission hullabaloo to the light of day may very well, researcher Samara Del Rio smiled with a perfectly beatific malfeasance, induce a state of anarchy. This my quest, to follow that star no matter how hopeless, no matter how far Along with Sam, ostensibly the team sociologist; Franciscan Brother and linguist Kolbe McCeanna and computer technician Felicia Bonaventura have tracked the legendary article to the derelict ruins of a minor auxiliary mission, Mision Estancia San Micmac, abandoned deep in the cathedral redwoods of Californias rugged pacific coast foothills. Exhibit-A.: as Sacramento knows, the notorious artifact is a legendary mission document lost since the colonial era, and thought to be a Spanish translation of aboriginal petroglyphs, entitled Las Cuentitas Primaveritas de Isla Califia. Past as prologue, a highly divisive work of folkloric Outside Art, colonial-era historians date the slim manuscript to the year 1561. Spakespearean scholars, however, citing key internal references to The Bards colonial-era play The Tempest, insist that the text is no older that the year 1611. Anti-Stratfordians, of course, call the Spakespearean theory leaky as an unstaunched wench. Adding to the debate, pre-Columbian archivists at Villa Poggio Gherado in Canterbury, England claim tevidence supporting a composition date of 1348. Equally divided, modern pundits dismiss Las Cuentitas as nothing more than psychosocial gibberish and third-rate poetic doggerel anyway, or else venerate the document as instrumental to a radical psychosocial transformation. Either way, if birds of a feather flock together than the infamous manuscript resembles a traditional book to the extent a penguin resembles an ostrich. [Embedded in translation throughout the plot of The California Tales], Las Cuentitas represents an extraordinary multimedia-literary genre suppressed censored and banned since the 1960s as irredeemably subversive to the status quo. During its brief hayday in the sun, the tempestuous genre was known as Prosperos Salient Heliotropic Articulation Grids: pSHAGs. And, particularly threatening to the dominate paradigm, pSHAG poetry, (or poemetry), was known, rather tongue-in-cheek, as Teleothanantological Neuropeptidal Algorithms: T.N.A.s. Moreover, reputedly encrypted within a Prospero SHAG TNA are the sole surviving fragments of the theoretical Archetypical Tale: the mother of all manuscripts, the lore at the core.

Even today, years after her death, the actress and author is still regarded as the pop archetype of sexual wantonness and ribald humor. But who was this saucy starlet, a woman who was controversial enough to be jailed, pursued by film censors and banned from the airwaves for the revolutionary content of her work, and yet would ascend to the status of film legend? Sifting through previously untapped sources, author Jill Watts unravels the enigmatic life of Mae West, tracing her early years spent in the Brooklyn subculture of boxers and underworld figures, and follows her journey through burlesque, vaudeville, Broadway and, finally, Hollywood, where she quickly became one of the big screen's most popular--and colorful--stars. Exploring West's penchant for contradiction and her carefully perpetuated paradoxes, Watts convincingly argues that Mae West borrowed heavily from African American culture, music, dance and humor, creating a subversive voice for herself by which she artfully challenged society and its assumptions regarding race, class and gender. Viewing West as a trickster, Watts demonstrates that by appropriating for her character the black tradition of double-speak and \\"signifying,\\" West also may have hinted at her own African-American ancestry and the phenomenon of a black woman passing for white. This absolutely fascinating study is the first comprehensive, interpretive account of Mae West's life and work. It reveals a beloved icon as a radically subversive artist consciously creating her own complex image.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xpMzyL6w2v4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Georgia vs. Georgia Tech: Gridiron Grudge Since 1893","description":"This first complete, illustrated history of one of the nation's most intense football rivalries, which dates back to 1893, includes more than 1,000 photos and a memorable roster of players and coaches such as Joe Heisman and Pop Warner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WIJ_PQAACAAJ&dq=Georgia+vs.+Georgia+Tech:+Gridiron+Grudge+Since+1893&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nutrition for the Golden Years: How to Add More Life to Your Life","description":"In The Mechanics of the Knee, Dr. David Morley offers a refreshingly common-sense and succinct approach to the growing problem of knee arthritis-and how to avoid knee-replacement surgery. \\"Many People have come to me over the years having no understanding of their knee arthritic problems,\\" writes Dr. David Morley, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. \\"They fail prey to clinicians who often prescribe aggressive, costly, and sometimes dangerous therapeutic options, including knee replacement.\\" And no one-man or woman, young or old, overweight or thin-is immune from knee pain. \\"If your job involves performing the same joint-stressing motions over and over,\\" he points out, \\"or carrying weight, or both, you are also a candidate.\\" In The Mechanics of the Knee, Dr. Morley offers a refreshingly commonsense and succinct approach to the growing problem of knee arthritis.

Enterprises are pursuing new ways of organizing systems and processes to become service oriented and event-driven. Leveraging existing infrastructural investments is a critical aspect to the success of companies both large and small. Enterprises have to adapt their systems to support frequent technological changes, mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, in a growing global market, these systems are being called upon to be used by external business partners. Technology is often difficult, costly and complex and without modern approaches can prevent the enterprise from becoming agile. Enterprise Service Oriented Architectures helps readers solve this challenge in making different applications communicate in a loosely coupled manner. This classic handbook leverages the experiences of thought leaders functioning in multiple industry verticals and provides a wealth of knowledge for creating the agile enterprise. In this book, you will learn: ? How to balance the delivery of immediate business value while creating long-term strategic capability ? Fundamental principles of a service-oriented architecture (find, bind and execute) ? The four aspects of SOA (Production, Consumption, Management and Provisioning) ? How to recognize critical success factors to implementing enterprise SOAs ? Architectural importance of service registries, interfaces and contracts ?

This pioneering book explores treatment and counseling options, and uses real-life case histories to examine the special challenges women with AD/HD face, such as the shame of not fulfilling societal expectations. Solden explains that AD/HD affects just as many women as men, and often results in depression, disorganization, anxiety, and underachievement. Included in this revised edition is a brand new chapter on friendship challenges for women with AD/HD. Three empowering steps -- restructuring one's life, renegotiating relationships, and redefining self-image -- help women take control of their lives and enjoy success on their own terms. \\"Sari Solden has used her personal and professional experience to shine some light into the dark closet inhabited by far too many ADD women...

Hall impresses us with mastery of poetic forms from around the world, including many complex Irish and Welsh forms of her ancestry. \\"Idaho Suite\\" pays homage to Hall's own private Idaho, its majestic wilderness deep within untamed America, her summer home in its center, the danger and delight surrounding it. \\"The Rest of The West\\" follows Hall through the Rockies, Pacific and Southwest, and the philosophical dilemmas of America as they emerge from her observation. In \\"Wild Things\\" Hall turns this voice inward to face the bears of her psyche while mirrored by the real dangers of animal encounters. Triumphant and uplifting \\"You Gotta Have Art\\" and \\"CeleBEARations\\" highlight Hall's literary prowess while filling the reader with positive spirit. \\"What About Our Teddy Bear?\\" sees the return of hero Gus Greenbear to the written page, complete with entourage and new adventures.

The original 100 color plates, meticulously reproduced here from the rare original folio edition, present a dazzling spectrum of copyright-free design motifs from both ancient and modern cultures. The Grammar of Ornament features designs from around the world: the West to the Far East and many cultures in between. Graphic and fine artists will find nearly three thousand designs rendered in fine detail from a variety of sources: Greek and Roman borders and mosaics Celtic designs taken from manuscripts Motifs from medieval paintings and stained glass Floral patterns from Chinese porcelain, wood, and fabrics Illuminated script from the Koran Ornamentation from Turkish mosques and tombs Moorish designs from the Alhambra Connoisseurs of art and design will find the book's rich display of decorative motifs an endless source of contemplative pleasures. The work of the celebrated English designer and architect Owen Jones, The Grammar of Ornament, initially published in 1856, was the first book to present a global and historical range of ornament in color, the first to display \\"primitive\\" art for its design content, and among the first to suggest nature as a basic design source. Widely used and circulated, this prophetic work ushered in a major change in Western aesthetics and heralded the move towards nonrepresentational art. Its value as a beautifully organized and produced pictorial museum of historic ornamental design remains unsurpassed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PIJbrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Grammar+of+Ornament:+All+100+Color+Plates+from+the+Folio+Edition+of+the+Great+Victorian+Sourcebook+of+Historic+Design+(Dover+Pictorial+Archive+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"taran wanderer","description":"Taran Wanderer, the fourth book in Lloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain Taran is an Assistant Pig-Keeper no longer--he has become a hero.

De schrijfstijl is vintage Sontag: trefzeker, stoer en stellig. Ze bracht de angsten en ambivalenties die veel mensen voelen tegenover moderne technologie in het algemeen, en fotografie in het bijzonder, messcherp onder woorden. Zelfs nu kun je amper een column, recensie of boek over fotografie lezen waarin Sontag niet wordt aangehaald  zeker wanneer het over foto s van oorlog, honger of geweld gaat.   Lynn Berger in De Correspondent Over fotografie is een boeiend relaas over wat foto s eigenlijk zijn, over esthetische en morele problemen waarmee we door hun alomtegenwoordigheid in onze mediacultuur worden geconfronteerd en over de (on)bedoelde effecten van fotografie. Het is een klassiek geworden, baanbrekend onderzoek naar de rol en de betekenis van beelden. Sontag weet het moderne leven zo scherpzinnig te vangen dat kritische vragen niet uit kunnen blijven.  Sontag heeft ons als geen ander geleerd na te denken over de rol en het effect van fotografie in onze tijd. Prachtige essays.   Trouw  Een mijlpaal in de reflectie over fotografie.

Primates differ from other animals by the intensity of their social relationships, by the amount of time they spend grooming one another. Not just a matter of hygiene, grooming is all about cementing bonds, making friends and influencing your fellow ape. Early humans, in their characteristic large groups of 150 or so, would have had to spend almost half their time in mutual grooming. Instead, Professor Robin Dunbar argues, they evolved a more efficient mechanism: language. It seems there is nothing idle about idle chatter. Having a good gossip ensures that a dynamic group - of hunter-gatherers, soldiers, workmates - remains cohesive. Men and women 'gossip' equally, but men tend to talk about themselves, while women talk more about other people, working to strengthen the female-female relationships that underpin both human and primate societies. Until now, most anthropologists have assumed that language developed in male-male relationships, during activities such as hunting. Dunbar's intriguing research suggests that, to the contrary, language evolved among women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AnJgtCIsSR0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"365 Ways To Cook Hamburger","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=unhzzQEACAAJ&dq=365+Ways+To+Cook+Hamburger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gen 13: We'll Take Manhattan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z3FQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gen+13:+We%27ll+Take+Manhattan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legion's Ladies (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Capturing the attention of the ton by aiding countless ladies in distress, the chivalrous Earl of Wright longs to find a sensible match for himself, until an assassination attempt puts him in the hands of a vicar's smitten daughter.

His writings which were popular during his own lifetime with the nobility as well as with the increasingly literate merchant class marked the first celebration of the English vernacular as a tongue worthy of literary endeavor, most notably in his unfinished narrative poem The Canterbury Tales, the format and structure of which continues to be imitated by writers today. But the impact of Chaucer s work was felt even into the 16th and 17th centuries, when the first major collections of his writings set a high standard for how authors should be presented to the reading public. This widely esteemed seven-volume set first published in the 1890s by British academic WALTER WILLIAM SKEAT (1835 1912), Erlington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge University is based solely on Chaucer s original manuscripts and the earliest available published works (with any significant variations or deviations between versions highlighted in the extensive notes), and comes complete with Skeat s informative commentary on many passages. Volume VII features works generally appended to collections of Chaucer s work, and sometimes attributed to him, including: Thomas Usk: The Testament of Love The Plowmans Tale Jack Upland John Gower: The Praise of Peace Thomas Hoccleve: The Letter of Cupid John Lydgate: The Complaint of the Black Knight Sir Richard Ros: A Balade: Warning Men to Beware of Deceitful Women and more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=53l5Qelye0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long is the road to freedom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Xl6AAAAAIAAJ&dq=Long+is+the+road+to+freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whoreson;: The story of a ghetto pimp","description":"A pimp's struggle to survive in Detroit's world of sudden violence and brutal sex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RtNLAAAAMAAJ&dq=Whoreson%3B:+The+story+of+a+ghetto+pimp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, Cinema","description":"\\"There is hardly a page in this collection of hard-thought and brilliantly written essays that does not yield some new insight.\\"  Hayden White \\"... de Lauretis's writing is brisk and refreshingly lucid.\\"  International Film Guide","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OTz_fUNh0awC&dq=Alice+Doesn%27t:+Feminism,+Semiotics,+Cinema&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & other battles to control cyberspace","description":"This is a story of the battle for the control of the Internet.

His car's been repossessed. His partner has died under mysterious circumstances. And his tail just won't stay put. Vincent is a dinosaur--a Velociraptor, to be precise. It seems the dinosaurs faked their extinction 65 million years ago and still roam the earth, disguised in convincing latex costumes that help them blend perfectly into human society. A heightened sense of smell allows the dinos to detect one another--Vincent's got an odor like a tasty Cuban cigar. When Vincent is called to investigate a two-bit case of arson at a hip dino nightclub, he discovers something much more sinister, which lures him back to New York City--the scene of his partner's death and a dangerous nexus of dinosaur and human intermingling. Will Vincent solve the mystery of his partner's death? Will a gorgeous blond chanteuse discover his true identity, jeopardizing both their lives?

Though the Bible clearly teaches that confession is a necessary part of the redemption story, many Christians are uncertain how and to whom they should confess their sins. Stott offers vital answers in Confess Your Sins: The Way of Reconciliation. After presenting the necessity of confession, Stott distinguishes between three types of confession in secret to God, in private to a person whom our sin has injured, and in public in the presence of a Christian congregation. He shows how this threefold distinction is biblically grounded, and he critically examines the practice of confessing to a priest. Offering assurance of forgiveness to Christians, this little book opens the door to fruitful conversation about the practice of confession.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ay1HDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Without Mercy: Obsession and Murder Under the Influence","description":"ON ANY SUNDAY MORNING IN THE FLORIDA REDLANDS, DEE CASTEEL MIGHT HAVE SERVED YOU PANCAKES AT THE IHOP   She was a hard-working, cheerful waitress, one of the nicest people you d ever want to know.

Why has his appeal endured over eight hundred years and even expanded beyond the world of Catholicism to make him one of the most beloved religious figures of all time? This penetrating meditation on Francis's life gently but sure-handedly cuts through every pious legend to uncover what is timeless and universally true about him. Christian Bobin's unexpected and thoroughly original work presents a compelling image of a man whose power is found in humility, whose radical casting aside of wealth, honor, and even personal identity is inseparable from his overwhelming intimacy with God. Poetic, luminous, utterly hypnotic, The Very Lowly is a unique modern variation on the saint's life that will entrance everyone, whether \\"religious\\" or almost especially not.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yy1F1Q1neb8C&dq=The+Very+Lowly:+A+Meditation+on+Francis+of+Assisi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children of the Alley: A Novel","description":"The tumultuous alley of this rich and intricate novel (first published in Arabic in 1959) is inhabited by a delightful Egyptian family, but is also the setting for a second, hidden, and more daring narrative: the spiritual history of humankind. The men and women of a modern Cairo neighborood unwittingly reenact the lives of their holy ancestors: from the feudal lord who disowns one son for diabolical pride and puts another to the test, to the savior of a succeeding generation who frees his people from bondage. This powerful novel confirms again the richness and variety of Mahfouz's storytelling and his status as \\"the single most important writer in modern Arabic literature\\" (Newsweek).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HZ5BDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Die If You Must: Brazilian Indians In The Twentieth Century (v. 3)","description":"Following 'Red Gold' and 'Amazon Frontier', this is the third and final volume of John Hemming's definitive account of the history of the Brazilian indians.

By adopting three key notions,  involvement ,  formality  and  gender , the study not only reveals the functions and pragmatic effects of each marker, but also sheds light on some fundamental issues of the nature of spoken discourse in general, including how speakers collaborate with each other to create and sustain their conversations and how linguistic functions of verbal forms interface with sociocultural norms. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in a wide range of linguistic fields such as Japanese linguistics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis and applied linguistics and to teachers and learners of Japanese and of a second/foreign language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xrr7DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Activist's Handbook: A Primer Updated Edition with a New Preface","description":"The Activist's Handbook is a hard-hitting guide to making social change happen. Shaw, a longtime activist for urban issues, shows how positive change can still be accomplished  despite an increasingly grim political order if activists employ the strategies set forth in this desperately needed primer. In a new preface, Shaw describes how the power of grassroots activism has won newfound respect. Mass protests against globalization and in favor of stricter gun controls have led once-invulnerable targets like the World Bank and the National Rifle Association to take citizen action more seriously. Inspiring \\"fear and loathing\\" in politicians, building diverse coalitions, and harnessing the media, the courts, and the electoral process to one's cause are only some of the key tactics Shaw advocates and explains. Central to all social-change activism, Shaw shows, is being proactive: rather than simply reacting to right-wing proposals, activists must develop an agenda and focus their resources on achieving it. The Activist's Handbook details the impact of specific strategies on campaigns across the country: battles over homelessness, the environment, AIDS policies, neighborhood preservation, and school reform among others. Though activist groups can have widely different aims, similar tactics are shown to produce success. Further, the book offers a sophisticated analysis of the American power structure by someone on the front lines. In showing how people can and must make a difference at both local and national levels, this is an indispensable guide not only for activists, but for everyone interested in the future of progressive politics in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ODTba7r293gC&dq=The+Activist%27s+Handbook:+A+Primer+Updated+Edition+with+a+New+Preface&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Widow's Web (The Scandalous Story of Sex and Murder That Rocked Arkansas from Top to Bottom)","description":"Dit boek is onderdeel van de TREDITION CLASSICS serie.

Ambrose completes his acclaimed biography of the man many historians call the most fascinating politician in American history: Richard Milhous Nixon. Rarely before on the stage of global politics has one man, respected and reviled, blessed and cursed, held us in such rapt attention. Using Nixon s own words, private writings, and tape-recorded conversations, Ambrose captures the man and all his contradictions as he faces the ordeal of Watergate and its aftermath, the long road back to public life. Watergate is a drama with high stakes and low skullduggery, of lies and bribes, of greed and lust for power. At its center is the obsession of the country and much of the world with President Richard Nixon himself. It is a remarkable play of foolhardy heroism as Nixon risked everything trying to maintain dignity and his job, when he alone had the power to determine the outcome of the scandal, whether by resigning, confessing, destroying evidence or defying the courts and Congress. Ambrose explains how Nixon destroyed himself through a combination of arrogance and indecision, allowing a \\"third-rate burglary\\" to escalate into a scandal that overwhelmed his presidency. Yet even after his self-exile from Washington and the Republican Party, even after the national outcry that sealed his shame, Nixon would not go gentle into oblivion. Ambrose provides an unforgettable portrait of the older Nixon in San Clemente, drawing on his seemingly endless reserves of determination, laying the groundwork for yet another comeback, a return to the arena that would defy all odds. Ambrose illuminates all the hidden years, and we see Nixon s gradual transformation from pariah to valued elder statesmen, respected internationally and at home even by those who had earlier clamored loudest for his head. This is the story of Nixon's final fall from grace and astonishing recovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JPBzAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DAY OF THE DINOSAUR (First Time Readers)","description":"Get the brilliant book about starting school, from bestselling author A.

Haar moeder, operazangeres Malena Ernman, beschrijft de moeilijke jaren die voorafgingen aan die dag in augustus: hoe Greta als jong meisje worstelde met depressies en een eetstoornis, hoe haar ouders zochten naar verklaringen en hoe ze omgingen met de diagnose die volgde, hoe Greta voor het eerst over klimaatverandering hoorde en niet kon stoppen erover na te denken, hoe ze haar gezin overtuigde om hun levensstijl fundamenteel te veranderen en te vechten - voor het klimaat en voor de toekomst.

Very few books tell so much about Australia, with elegance and concision, as does his' - Professor Michael Roe 'Stimulating and informative. an antidote to the cultural cringe' - Canberra Times 'To be Australian': what can that mean? Inventing Australia sets out to find the answers by tracing the images we have used to describe our land and our people - the convict hell, the workingman's paradise, the Bush legend, the 'typical' Australian from the shearer to the Bondi lifesaver, the land of opportunity, the small rich industrial country, the multicultural society. The book argues that these images, rather than describing an especially Australian reality, grow out of assumptions about nature, race, class, democracy, sex and empire, and are 'invented' to serve the interests of particular groups. There have been many books about Australia's national identity; this is the first to place the discussion within an historical context to explain how Australians' views of themselves change and why these views change in the way they do.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZVLzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Petersburg and the Broad River Valley of Georgia;: Their rise and decline","description":"Old Petersburg and the Broad River Valley of Georgia details colonial life at Petersburg, Georgia, at the junction of Broad and Savannah Rivers.

Since then, he has written a number of extremely influential essays that illustrate approaches to the study of Japanese religious phenomena. To date, these essays have remained scattered in various scholarly journals. This book makes available nineteen of these articles, important contributions to our understanding of Japan's intricate combination of indigenous Shinto, Confucianism, Taoism, the Yin-Yang School, Buddhism, and folk religion. In sections on prehistory, the historic development of Japanese religion, the Shinto tradition, the Buddhist tradition, and the modem phase of the Japanese religious tradition, the author develops a number of valuable methodological approaches. The volume also includes an appendix on Buddhism in America. Asserting that the study of Japanese religion is more than an umbrella term covering investigations of separate traditions, Professor Kitagawa approaches the subject from an interdisciplinary standpoint. Skillfully combining political, cultural, and social history, he depicts a Japan that seems a microcosm of the religious experience of humankind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MzQGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One of a Kind: Making the Most of Your Child's Uniqueness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kwXb18IuC7QC&dq=One+of+a+Kind:+Making+the+Most+of+Your+Child%27s+Uniqueness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talk of Angels","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QC1tzgEACAAJ&dq=Talk+of+Angels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Man's Land Vol 1","description":"\\"After suffering a cataclysmic earthquake, the U.S. government has deemed Gotham City as uninhabitable and ordered all citizens to leave.

Just three days after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, four huge Luftwaffe flying boats called the Kondor K-II took off from a secret base in Bavaria.

Throughout its 34-year Air Force career, the SR-71 proved itself to be the world's fastest and highest flying operational manned aircraft. It set a number of world records for altitude and speed, including an absolute altitude record of 85,069ft on 28 July 1974, and an absolute speed record of 2,193.2mph the same day.

From the revolutionary \\"The Great Pax Whitie\\" and \\"Poem for Aretha\\" to the sublime \\"Ego Tripping\\" and the tender \\"My House,\\" these 150 mind-speaking, truth-telling poems are at once powerful yet sensual, angry yet affirming. Arranged chronologically, they reflect the changes Giovanni has endured as a Black woman, lover, mother, teacher, and poet. Here is the evocation of a nation's past and present -- intensely personal and fiercely political -- from one of our most compassionate, outspoken observers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e9tpFY2cmCAC&dq=The+Selected+Poems+of+Nikki+Giovanni:+1968-1995&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choice Centered Astrology: The Basics","description":"A practical approach that provides basics for understanding astrological charts.

Defaced tombstones. Sexual abuse in daycare centers. Is America threatened by a satanic conspiracy? In this book, Robert D. Hicks exposes law enforcement's obsessive preoccupation with Satanism as a model for criminal behavior. While satanic belief has played a part in crimes ranging from petty vandalism to serial murders, Hicks avows that there is no substantial evidence for the existence of a nationwide satanic crime continuum. Hicks points out that the satanic criminal model is expedient largely due to its simplicity and economy, reducing to simple formulas such complex problems as drug abuse, teen suicide, and sexual molestation. His research utilizes a unique blend of law-enforcement methodology, anthropology, folklore, history, sociology, psychology and psychiatry. He attributes the cult conspiracy theory to beliefs fueled by Christian fundamentalist sects and to the ungovernable mechanisms of rumor-panics, subversive mythology, and urban legend. In Pursuit of Satan documents examples of rumor-panics in which the police have fomented fear by attributing crimes to Satanists, indulging in sheer speculation and promulgating misinformation through the sensationalist news media. Hicks examines the construction of the satanic ideology among law enforcement officials, focusing on the exploitation of Satanism as a new scapegoat for public fears and addressing the phenomenon of credulity among police forces and allied professionals in social work, psychiatry, and psychology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZJRQAQAAIAAJ&dq=In+Pursuit+of+Satan:+The+Police+and+the+Occult&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classroom use.: An article from: Arts & Activities","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fsREAQAAIAAJ&dq=Classroom+use.:+An+article+from:+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Icebox Pies (Non)","description":"Most of us think of pies as complicated, oven-baked affairs. But icebox pies are different: they're easy. There's no rolling of pastry dough-the crusts are cookie crumbs, patted into the pan and quickly crisped in the oven. The fillings are either uncooked or prepared on the stovetop. The pies set in the refrigerator or freezer for a few hours before being served. And that's all there is to it. Pies this simple don't need to be reserved for special occasions. They can be made in minutes and served anytime. Icebox Pies begins with a chapter on inventive crumb crusts and ends with a chapter on luscious toppings, and in between are the delectable pies themselves. There's a chapter on indulgent mousse, pudding, and custard pies, with selections as down-home as Marshmallow Pie (it's just what it sounds like) and as refined as Toasted Almond Semifreddo Pie (made even more special with an Amaretti Crust). If you love chocolate, there's a whole chapter just for you, where you'll find Chocolate Cream Cheese Pie, Triple Chocolate Mint Pie, Black Bottom Butterscotch Pie, and more. There's also a chapter on scrumptious fruit-and-cream combinations, including Lime Cream and Strawberry Pie and Cherry and Mascarpone Cream Pie. There are plenty of ways to use ice cream, frozen yogurt, and sorbet to make the simplest icebox pies. There are lots of kid-friendly desserts in this chapter, like Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Pie and Banana Split Ice Cream Pie (try it with the Sugar Cone Crust). But there are also some surprisingly grown-up desserts for casual entertaining. Mango and Coconut Ice Cream Pie served with rum-infused Warm Caramel Sauce is a wonderful way to end a summer dinner party. Finally, there are recipes that will make you say, ''I can't believe it's an icebox pie, '' like the Fresh Raspberry and Blueberry Pie topped with Honey Whipped Cream. Simple and satisfying for experienced bakers and beginners alike, Icebox Pies presents a whole new way to make dessert without a whole lot of work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YC1qhQLi-XAC&dq=Icebox+Pies+(Non)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A CITY OF BELLS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9pcPSgAACAAJ&dq=A+CITY+OF+BELLS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Medieval Songbook: Troubadour & Trouvere.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ms4IAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Medieval+Songbook:+Troubadour&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knives: Points of Interest, Book 3","description":"The Bowie is the most famous of American knives.

Paradoxically characterized as both barbaric and innocent, the Celts appeal to the modern world as a symbol of a bygone era, a world destroyed by the ambition of empire and the spread of Christianity throughout Western Europe. Despite the pervasive cultural and literary influence of the Celts, shockingly little is known of their way of life and beliefs, because very few records of their stories exist. In this book, for the first time, Philip Freeman brings together the best stories of Celtic mythology. Everyone today knows about the gods and heroes of the ancient Greeks, such as Zeus, Hera, and Hercules, but how many people have heard of the Gaulish god Lugus or the magical Welsh queen Rhiannon or the great Irish warrior C  Chulainn? We still thrill to the story of the Trojan War, but the epic battles of the Irish T in B  Cuailgne are known only to a few. And yet those who have read the stories of Celtic myth and legend-among them writers like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis-have been deeply moved and influenced by these amazing tales, for there is nothing in the world quite like them. In these stories a mysterious and invisible realm of gods and spirits exists alongside and sometimes crosses over into our own human world; fierce women warriors battle with kings and heroes, and even the rules of time and space can be suspended. Captured in vivid prose these shadowy figures-gods, goddesses, and heroes-come to life for the modern reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9qL_DQAAQBAJ&dq=Celtic+Goddess+(P)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piano Concerto No. 10 in E-Flat Major for Two Pianos, K. 365 (Kalmus Edition)","description":"A Piano Duet for 2 pianos, 4 hands, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LxiRIdPnlbMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World War II is not over: A combat infantryman's experiences in a German POW camp : 70th Infantry Division","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fUUutAEACAAJ&dq=World+War+II+is+not+over:+A+combat+infantryman%27s+experiences+in+a+German+POW+camp+:+70th+Infantry+Division&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fred","description":"In Leer van Fred doet stylist Fred van Leer een boekje open over zijn persoonlijke leven, en deelt hij zijn beste stylingtips.

Luk cs's History and Class Consciousness has been called one of the three most influential philosophical works of this century, and he, the outstanding Marxist philosopher. Marxism has long suffered relative neglect in philosophical discussion as a result of its own invidious distinction between itself and the supposed irrationality of what it regards as bourgeois philosophy. Tom Rockmore offers a uniquely detailed philosophical analysis of Luk cs's entire position as a theory of reason, based on the distinction between reason and unreason, or irrationalism. The author gives special emphasis to Luk cs's connection to German neo-Kantianism, particularly Lask, and on his last, unfinished work. Rockmore begins with an account of the roots of Luk cs's Marxism, followed by an in-depth analysis of his often mentioned, but still incompletely understood, seminal essay \\"Reification and the Class Consciousness of the Proletariat.\\" He then traces the evolution and later demise of the distinction between reason and irrationalism in Luk cs's final thought. The author thus makes available for the first time in English a strictly philosophical discussion of Georg Luk cs's Marxist phase and brings consideration of his thought into the wider philosophical discussion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x3v5R45WLWIC&dq=Irrationalism:+Lukacs+and+the+Marxist+View+of+Reason&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New England Days (Imago Mundi Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cDB1QgAACAAJ&dq=New+England+Days+(Imago+Mundi+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maya 4.5 Savvy","description":"Updated to incorporate the latest version of Maya, an informative guide to the popular tool for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering combines hands-on tutorials with real-world examples to demonstrate a variety of helpful techniques and tools and is accompanied by a CD-ROM containing 3D rendering and animation project demos, plug-ins, and more.

In other words, the skin/hair thang among black women. It begins with TaRessa Stovall's \\"My People, My People,\\" in which a successful advertising executive acquires firsthand knowledge of prejudice when her clients insist on using light- rather than dark-skinned models. Next comes Tracy Price-Thompson's award-winning story \\"Other People's Skin,\\" a tale set in 1970s Louisiana, where a dark-skinned young woman must come to terms with the bigotry of her light-skinned family. \\"New Birth,\\" by Desiree Cooper reveals the intense roles that money, class, and skin color play in the intra-racial relationship between Catherine, a wealthy, light-skinned lawyer, and Lettie, her dark-skinned house cleaner. Finally, Elizabeth Atkin's \\"Take It Off\\" tells the story of a biracial girl who hides her coarse, braided hair from her friends at a mixed-race university in Detroit. Other People's Skin is the most innovative and varied anthology of sisterhood and unity to date. Each novella entertains, challenges, and, most important, offers healing to the reader -- no matter what her race, skin tone, or state of mind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j212xe419f4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","description":"De ongelijkheid in de wereld verklaard Waarom hebben de Australische aboriginals niet de wereld veroverd?

ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Ray Bradbury's internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 is a masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television rules and literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television \\"family.\\" But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8Q3YwgEACAAJ&dq=Fahrenheit+451+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Project Management: Tips, Tactics, and Tools","description":"The author has 39 years of experience implementing project management techniques.

It sweeps away the myth that the army suffered from poor morale, and that it only won its battles thorugh the use of 'brute force' and by reverting to the techniques of the First World War. David French analyses the place of the army in British strategy in the interwar period and during the Second World War. He shows that after 1918 the General Staff tried hard to learn the lessons of the First World War, enthusiastically embracing technology as the best way of minimizing future casualties. In the first half of the Second World War the army did suffer from manifold weaknesses, not just in the form of shortages of equipment, but also in the way in which it applied its doctrine. Few soldiers were actively eager to close with the enemy, but the morale of the army never collapsed and its combat capability steadily improved from 1942 onwards. Professor French assesses Montgomery's contributions to the war effort and concludes that most important were his willingness to impose a uniform understanding of doctrine on his subordinates, and to use mechanized firepower in ways quite different from Haig in the First World War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J0ybZxREupYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wine Country Architecture and Interiors","description":"Provides a richly illustrated tour of the homes and lifestyles of nineteen homes throughout the Napa and Sonoma valleys, capturing a sophisticated, gracious style of living that reflects the old world styles of Italy, France, and South America in such locales as Villa Pietra, Quintessa Winery, Far Niente Winery, and the Franciscan Oakville Estate, among others. 10,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xaXPDIool3AC&dq=Wine+Country+Architecture+and+Interiors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","description":"Leading evangelical scholar John Walton surveys the cultural context of the ancient Near East, bringing insight to the interpretation of specific Old Testament passages.

The precise recollection of his own family-love, parental and marital, is vital to him; it is the matter in which the saving truth is incarnate. . . . Pigeon Feathers is not just a book of very brilliant short stories; it is a demonstration of how the most gifted writer of his generation is coming to maturity; it shows us that Mr. Updike s fine verbal talent is no longer pirouetting, however gracefully, out of a simple delight in motion, but is beginning to serve his deepest insight.

It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded Mastering Oracle SQL has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL. For those who want to harness the untapped (and often overlooked) power of Oracle SQL, this essential guide for putting Oracle SQL to work will prove invaluable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r5vbGgz7TFsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maya Quest: Interactive Expedition","description":"Follows the author as he explores Mexico, Belize, and Guatamala by bicycle, visiting Maya remains, learning about their civilization, and reporting on his discoveries on the Internet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xJARPQAACAAJ&dq=Maya+Quest:+Interactive+Expedition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Bowyers of America: The Bowhunting and Bowmaking World of the Nation's Top Crafters of Longbows And Recurves","description":"Expert bowhunter and archery traditionalist Dan Bertalan has compiled the most complete bowmaking text available today.

Neither one thought of giving up on each other, or on Afghanistan, even as tragedy entered their lives. This is a story about love and faith in the midst of Afghanistan's desperate struggle to become a civil society; about the courage needed to renounce a father whose hidden evil tormented his daughter; and about deep love and joy shared by a willful, independent spirit, and a commanding, dedicated man who gave his wife limits, yet freed her from tyranny.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tf_hAAAACAAJ&dq=Drinkers+of+the+Wind:+An+Afghan+Odyssey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic","description":"Seven families are helped out by Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's magic cures when they are faced with tattletales, never-want-to-go-to-schoolers, and waddle-I-doers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4gJXFzHT6vIC&dq=Mrs.+Piggle-Wiggle%27s+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coping with the Dangers of Tattooing, Body Piercing, and Branding","description":"Gives information needed to make an informed decision about body modification including the laws and safety regulations surrounding this business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FNwgkXnfsq4C&dq=Coping+with+the+Dangers+of+Tattooing,+Body+Piercing,+and+Branding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AIDS Law in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)","description":"The Reader's Guide to Lesbian and Gay Studies surveys the field in some 470 entries on individuals (Adrienne Rich); arts and cultural studies (Dance); ethics, religion, and philosophical issues (Monastic Traditions); historical figures, periods, and ideas (Germany between the World Wars); language, literature, and communication (British Drama); law and politics (Child Custody); medicine and biological sciences (Health and Illness); and psychology, social sciences, and education (Kinsey Report).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zXOMAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No place on earth","description":"This renowned journalist's classic Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation of schizophrenia now reissued with a new postscript follows a flamboyant and fiercely intelligent young woman as she struggles in the throes of mental illness.  Sylvia Frumkin  was born in 1948 and began showing signs of schizophrenia in her teens. She spent the next seventeen years in and out of mental institutions. In 1978, reporter Susan Sheehan took an interest in her and, for more than two years, became immersed in her life: talking with her, listening to her monologues, sitting in on consultations with doctors even, for a period, sleeping in the bed next to her in a psychiatric center. With Sheehan, we become witness to Sylvia s plight: her psychotic episodes, the medical struggle to control her symptoms, and the overburdened hospitals that, more often than not, she was obliged to call home. The resulting book, first published in 1982, was hailed as an extraordinary achievement: harrowing, humanizing, moving, and bitingly funny. Now, some two decades later, Is There No Place on Earth for Me? continues to set the standard for accounts of mental illness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aRg5AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hoofbeats: Katie and the Mustang Gift Set [BOX SET]","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0bQNAAAACAAJ&dq=Hoofbeats:+Katie+and+the+Mustang+Gift+Set+%5BBOX+SET%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mickey Mouse Stories Big Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qRlLT1xnirQC&dq=Mickey+Mouse+Stories+Big+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","description":"Superman and Batman work together to battle evil in many forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IQ_gPwAACAAJ&dq=Superman/Batman,+Vol.+2:+Supergirl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside Death Valley: [a guide & reference text]","description":"Originally published in 1995, soon after Death Valley National Park became the fifty-third park in the US park system, The Explorer s Guide to Death Valley National Park was the first complete guidebook available for this spectacular area.

Stressing the need to forage safely and not eat any plant unless completely certain of its identification and that it's free of pesticides and herbicides, the author explains 'what makes wild food special' before describing methods of preparation and food types, winemaking and the wild food seasons. Main courses and desserts are intermingled so much so that it becomes hard to tell whether the ingredient is a main component or an enhancer. Filled with humorous anecdotes and small descriptions, almost every recipe relies on at least one foraged ingredient, though where possible Brill offers health store alternatives (while Monsieur Wildman's French Dressing calls for wild spearmint, he does suggest cultivated mint; unsweetened apple juice can be substituted for wild apples in Spiced Wild Apple Cider). In the end, the book will appeal to those who enjoy foraging in the wild as well as the vegetarian who is not only health- but also environmentally conscious.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IsAcfkLb1hoC&dq=The+Wild+Vegetarian+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Canyon passage","description":"\\"Canyon Passage\\" by Ernest Haycox.

Sisterhood Is Forever -- with over 60 original essays Morgan commissioned from well-known feminist leaders plus energetic Gen X and Y activists -- is a composite mural of the female experience in America: where we've been, where we are, where we're going. The stunning scope of topics ranges from reproductive, health, and environmental issues to workplace inequities and the economics of women's unpaid labor; from globalization to the politics of aging; from cyberspace, violence against women, and electoral politics to spirituality, the law, the media, and academia. The deliberately audacious mix of contributors spans different generations, races, ethnicities, and sexual preferences: CEOs, housewives, rock stars, farmers, scientists, prostituted women, politicians, women in prison, firefighters, disability activists, artists, flight attendants, an army general, an astronaut, an anchorwoman, even a pair of teens who edit a girls' magazine. Each article celebrates the writer's personal voice -- her humor, passion, anger, and the integrity of her perspective -- while offering the latest data on women's status, political analysis, new \\"how-to\\" tools for activism, and visionary yet practical strategies for the future -- strategies needed now more than ever. Robin Morgan's own contributions are everything her readers expect: prophetic, powerfully argued, unsentimentally lyrical.

Although confused at first and quickly imprisoned, he soon realises that his knowledge of the future can transform his fate. Correctly predicting a solar eclipse from inside his prison cell, Morgan terrifies the people of England into releasing him and swiftly establishes himself as the most powerful magician in the land, stronger than Merlin and greatly admired by Arthur himself. But the Connecticut Yankee wishes for more than simply a place at the Round Table. Soon, he begins a far greater struggle: to bring American democratic ideals to Old England. Complex and fascinating, A Connecticut Yankee is a darkly comic consideration of the nature of human nature and society.

The contributors provide a comprehensive examination of how textbooks, the most dominant cultural force in which corporations and political leaders impact the schooling curricula, shape students  thoughts and behavior, perpetuate power in dominant groups, and trivialize social groups who are oppressed on the structural axes of race, class, gender, sexuality, and (dis)ability. Several contributors also generate critical insight in how power shapes the production of textbooks and evaluate whether textbooks still perpetuate dominant Western narratives that normalize and privilege patriotism, militarism, consumerism, White supremacy, heterosexism, rugged individualism, technology, and a positivistic conception of the world. Finally, the book highlights several textbooks that challenge readers to rethink their stereotypical views of the Other, to reflect upon the constitutive forces causing oppression in schools and in the wider society, and to reflect upon how to challenge corporate and political dominance over knowledge production.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qWcBBKOwzQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","description":"Since 1973, TEXAS MONTHLY has chronicled life in contemporary Texas, reporting on vital issues such as politics, the environment, industry, and education.

The result was one of the most remarkable and comprehensive pictorial collections ever produced. Now 92 meticulously rendered full-color plates - nearly all those pertaining to Western clothing, 900-1800, in the rare, original edition of Le Costume Historique - have been superbly reproduced in the present volume and are available for the first time at an affordable price. Over 950 clearly detailed, costumed figures present a magnificent panorama of clothing styles worn in major countries of Western Europe over a thousand-year period - ranging from 9th-century civil, military and religious garb to the Empire look of feminine fashion in the early 1800s. Included are figures representative of a variety of social classes, professions and nationalities - from medieval warriors, noblemen and merchants to Spanish clerics and nobility, Italian courtiers, Polish merchants and French soldiers, high-born ladies and demure middle-class damsels. Costumes displayed are equally diverse: bizarrely ornamented helmets and jointed suits of armor from the Middle Ages; striped tights and flowing coats of the early 15th century; doublets, puffed sleeves, neck ruffs and tight bodices of the 16th century; wide collars, knee-length breeches and the newly introduced vest in the 17th century; and in the late 18th century, a change from courtly styles to country modes. This comprehensive treasury of copyright-free illustrations - suitable for a host of design projects - will delight not only students and historians of fashion design, commercial artists, illustrators and art lovers, but will prove an indispensable sourcebook for anyone interested in the history and evolution of Western dress.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ggPgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Racinet%27s+Full-Color+Pictorial+History+of+Western+Costume:+With+92+Plates+Showing+Over+950+Authentic+Costumes+from+the+Middle+Ages+to+1800&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady or the Tiger?

But while this beloved character has achieved literary immortality, he is ultimately misunderstood. He has a penchant for lying, to be sure, but it s when he avoids going to school that he repeatedly gets into trouble, making The Adventures of Pinocchio an unusually timely novel about the importance of education, in our increasingly authoritarian times, to prevent our strings being pulled. This effervescent new translation captures the antic spirit that makes the mischievous, egotistical, and easily distracted Pinocchio a late nineteenth-century prototype for the likes of Bart Simpson. Featuring copious annotations informed by the translators  deep knowledge of Italy, it reveals the novel to be not only a subversively entertaining children s book but also a sophisticated satire reflecting the author s concern for the social inequality of his time and his belief that duty to others is at the core of our humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VNIcEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The wedding procession of the rag doll and the broom handle and who was in it","description":"Originally published: New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc., 1922.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i6vPDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+wedding+procession+of+the+rag+doll+and+the+broom+handle+and+who+was+in+it&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","description":"Wulf is an ancient Viking warrior with a useful but extremely aggravating power-amnesia.

Morgan's expositions sparkle as they enhance Bible texts from every chapter in the Bible. Concise and delightfully free of redundancy, these selections reveal the master expositor's keen, analytical insight into God's Word. To encourage preachers and Bible teachers to develop their own sermon and lesson themes creatively, the author mentions that these are sermon suggestions -- not sermons or sermon outlines. He intentionally left the notes untitled, \\"preferring to let the text of Scripture be their only caption.\\" These penetrating truths, firmly anchored in Scripture, are best described by G. Campbell Morgan himself: On every page of...the \\"God-breathed Writings\\" there are many thoughts which stretch out like long, clear arms of light across the darkness, discovering things which otherwise were hidden, and often illuminating wider areas than those of the immediate context. They are searchlights. From the multitude of these, I have selected one in each chapter of the Bible. Perhaps the work will also serve to illustrate a method of showing how focal points of radiating light gather their radiance from the context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mUP7DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Word&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson","description":"An exhaustive look at the final hours of the Confederacy s most audacious general. May 1863. The Civil War was in its third spring, and Confederate Lt. Gen. Thomas Jonathan Jackson stood at the peak of his fame. He had risen from obscurity to become  Old Stonewall,  adored across the South and feared and respected throughout the North. On the night of May 2, however, just hours after Jackson executed the most audacious maneuver of his career and delivered a crushing blow against an unsuspecting Union army at Chancellorsville, disaster struck. The Last Days of Stonewall Jackson recounts the events of that fateful night considered one of the most pivotal moments of the war and the tense vigil that ensued as Jackson struggled with a foe even he could not defeat. From Guinea Station, where Jackson crosses the river to rest under the shade of the trees, the story follows Jackson s funeral and burial, the strange story of his amputated arm, and the creation and restoration of the building where he died (now known as the Stonewall Jackson Shrine). This newly revised and expanded second edition features more than 50 pages of fresh material, including almost 200 illustrations, maps, and eye-catching photos. New appendices allow readers to walk in Jackson s prewar footsteps through his adopted hometown of Lexington, Virginia; consider the ways Jackson s memory has been preserved through monuments, memorials, and myths; and explore the misconceptions behind the Civil War s great What-If:  What if Stonewall had survived his wounds?  With the engaging prose of master storytellers, Chris Mackowski and Kristopher D. White make The Last Days of Stonewall Jackson a must-read for Civil War novices and buffs alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q8OIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Till The Dreaming's Done: Poems Crafted For Thinking People","description":"Andy Harley was born and raised in Frederick, Maryland where he still currently resides.

Dahl brilliantly conveys the bizarre reality of a wartime pilot's daily existence, where death is a constant companion and life is lived from one heartbeat to the next. 'One of the most widely read and influential writers of our generation' The Times 'The great magician' Spectator Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults.

A seminal figure in the history of American theater, he introduced to the U.S. the sophistication of European developments in stage design, experiments with lighting, and painterly effects which paralleled developments in modernist literature, painting, and dance. Architect of Dreams documents more than 100 finely rendered watercolors, photographs, and three-dimensional stage models.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals. From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the Confessions (in two volumes); On the City of God (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of Letters which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HIfYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Saint+Augustine%27s+Confessions+(The+Loeb+classical+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linguistic Theory and the Function of Word Order in Dutch: A Study on Interprentice Aspects of the Order of Adverbials and Noun Phrases (Studies of)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mossflower","description":"The second book in the beloved, bestselling Redwall saga - soon to be a major Netflix movie!

Ze laat zien dat het verhaal van de familie Lacks onlosmakelijk verbonden is met de duistere geschiedenis van het experimenteren met Afrikaans-Amerikanen, het ontstaan van de ethiek binnen de biologie en de juridische strijd over de vraag of we de baas zijn over de materie waarvan we zijn gemaakt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=glIqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ford Ranchero Muscle Portfolio 1957-1979 (Muscle Portfolio Series)","description":"This coupe-utility was introduced in 1957 in the sales battle with Chevrolet. The line switched sizes and platforms several times over the years. Originally based on the Custom sedans disappointing sales meant a switch to the Falcon after which sales rose. Over the next decade the Ranchero became more sporty taking on elements of the Torino and, from 1977, the front-end of the LTD II. Small pick-ups became fashionable and so the last Ranchero appeared in 1979. This is a book of contemporary road and comparison tests, technical and specification data, owner's views, engine swapping, model introductions and history. Models covered include: Custom Ranchero, 292, 352, Falcon Ranchero 289, 6 & V8, Fairlane Ranchero 390, 221, Torino Ranchero 302, 351, Hacienda, XA, 500A/T, 4100A/T, GT, LTD II Ranchero.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BK-gAAAACAAJ&dq=Ford+Ranchero+Muscle+Portfolio+1957-1979+(Muscle+Portfolio+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chef Manager, The","description":"In this book, How to Open a Restaurant: Due Diligence, you will find out the  first things first  the expertise needed to open a restaurant, the steps you need to take early on, and a guide to help you complete the steps.

Who was Jack Ruby? Madman? Superpatriot? Conspirator? Two top writers achieve a gripping portrait of the complex and contradictory character of Jack Ruby - a man who grew up in an immigrant home with a drunken father and an insane mother, who climbed out of the ghetto to become the owner of a popular Dallas nightclub. The authors let his friends and employees describe the Jack Ruby they knew. He was a punch-happy scrapper who fought before he thought because \\"I might lose my nerve.\\" Ruby could \\"cuss straight on like saying his prayers\\" but didn't allow dirty talk in front of his lady strippers. He could fire an employee seventeen times and pay for her kid's operation. A bachelor, he \\"respected\\" his fiancee of twelve years too much to marry her. He sought the company of cops, newsmen, anyone he thought important. Jack Ruby had many acquaintances but his only real friends were his dogs. Living in the fringe-society of hucksters and hustlers, Jack Ruby longed to be a big man in Dallas. Until the day he died he had a childlike awe of \\"class,\\" respectability, and the law. Wills and Demaris get completely inside the mind of this complex man. They recreate the day Jack Ruby woke, got an SOS call from one of his girls, shaved, dressed, said good-bye to his dogs, drove downtown, parked his car illegally, walked over to the crowd and shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. The reader understands. He did it \\"for Jackie and the kids\\" and because he was Jack Ruby. With the same graphic immediacy the authors describe those first stunned minutes of disbelief after the murder, Ruby's incomprehension of his position, his grotesque camaraderie with his old friends on the Dallas police force (\\"You all know me...\\"). The authors move jail to courtroom, catching the carnival atmosphere of Ruby's trial--with brilliant portraits of defense attorney Belli and prosecutor Alexander--and finally to the hospital room where Ruby died. This book reveals Jack Ruby as no other has. It is a story of a marked life, of a man whose precarious sanity was destroyed by the events he created--who spent his last mortal strength trying to persuade the world that he did his duty as an American, a Texan, and a Jew when he killed the man who killed Kennedy.--From jacket flap","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Bkl3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Jack+Ruby&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to the Pentateuch (Exploring the Old Testament)","description":"Up to date, reliable, balanced and clearly organized, Gordon Wenham's introductory textbook makes scholarship on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy accessible to contemporary students and readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bZ2sCwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Guide+to+the+Pentateuch+(Exploring+the+Old+Testament)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biblical Hebrew for beginners","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XLfrOQAACAAJ&dq=Biblical+Hebrew+for+beginners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Winter Dark","description":"Night falls, in a lonely valley called the Sink, four people prepare for a quiet evening.

That this was not, in fact, the case was a painful lesson that the months of September, October, November, and December would make clear with stark emphasis. The story of the sweep from Normandy to the German frontier has been told in the already published Breakout and Pursuit. The present volume relates the experiences of the First and Ninth U.S. Armies, the First Allied Airborne Army, and those American units which fought under British and Canadian command, on the northern flank of the battle front that stretched across the face of Europe from the Netherlands to the Mediterranean. The operations of the Third U.S. Army in the center, from mid-September through mid-December, have been recounted in The Lorraine Campaign; those of the Seventh U.S. Army on the south will be told in The Riviera to the Rhine, a volume in preparation. Unlike the grand sweep of the pursuit, the breaching of the West Wall called for the most grueling kind of fighting. Huge armies waged the campaign described' in this book, but the individual soldier, pitting his courage and stamina against harsh elements as well as a stubborn enemy, emerges as the moving spirit of these armies. In the agony of the Huertgen Forest, the frustration of MARKET-GARDEN, the savagery of the struggle for Aachen, the valor of the American soldier and his gallant comrades proved the indispensable ingredient of eventual victory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lOb2sgEACAAJ&dq=The+Siegfried+Line+Campaign&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smoking Collectibles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W9H1AAAACAAJ&dq=Smoking+Collectibles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside the Minstrel Mask: Readings in Nineteenth-Century Blackface Minstrelsy","description":"A sourcebook of contemporary and historical commentary on America's first popular mass entertainment.

Indeed, these imitations and parodies shaped society's perceptions of African Americans-and of women-as well as made their mark on national identity, policymaking decisions, and other entertainment forms such as vaudeville, burlesque, the revue, and, eventually, film, radio, and television.

Aside from empty threats and diplomatic hand wringing, the West has done little to stop the ethnic cleansing, the sieges, and the brutality that has characterized the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Contrary to common wisdom, the hyper-violent disintegration of the former Yugoslavia is not simply and exclusively the product of inherent and irrational ethnic animosities and centuries of strife. In this engaging book, journalist Christopher Bennett traces the turning point to the 1987 struggle within the Serbian Communist party which was between adherents of a Serb nationalist ideology -embodied by Slobodan Milosevic- and the other Yugoslavs who clung to the vision of a multinational state. As soon as Milosevic gained the upper hand, he ruthlessly purged his rivals and launched a massive campaign of media indoctrination to stir up Serb nationalism. This new nationalism, which has repelled the world since 1991, is primarily Milosevic's creation and not merely the result of historical enmity. As a student at two different Yugoslav universities in the 1980's, Bennett witnessed firsthand many if the critical events which contributed to Yugoslavia's destruction. He renders an incisive and accessible history, covering the period from Tito's dictatorship to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6mQVCgAAQBAJ&dq=Yugoslavia-manipulations+with+the+number+of+Second+World+War+victims+%3D:+Jugoslavija-manipulacije+zrtvama+drugog+svjetskog+rata&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Questions & Answers About Anxiety","description":"EMPOWER YOURSELF!

When the men are borne into an Acadian settlement in central Louisiana on one of the first experimental steam carriages, an irresistible tide of vengence and revenge is unleashed. The mystical forces conjured by a voodoo priestess and a Choctaw Indian chief reach even into the twentieth century.

Its acquisition is essential for students who wish to speak (or understand) natural Japanese, read literature or manga, or watch anime in the original. The problem is that Japanese onomatopoeic words are so different from their English equivalents (words such as pop, bang, splat, and squeak) that they are extremely hard to remember and put into practice. The book begins with an introduction that outlines what \\"onomatopoeia\\" means in both English and Japanese. It covers sound and meaning in general, onomatopoeia in English, sound symbolism in English and Japanese, Japanese onomatopoeia and mimesis, types of Japanese onomatopoeia, grammatical functions of Japanese onomatopoeia, Japanese written forms, and how new Japanese onomatopoeic words are formed (for example, in manga). This introductory material is all-important, for without the overall picture it presents, students are forced to learn Japanese onomatopoeia by rote, one word at a time, as if each was unique unto itself, as if each had no logical connection with any other word, and as if Japanese onomatopoeia was a huge, ugly hodgepodge instead of the beautiful, well-organized microcosm that it is. However, this introduction alone would not suffice to produce fluency. Onomatopoeia must be seen in action for that to happen. This is done in the second part of the book, which consists of eleven situational dialogues that allow students to eavesdrop on Japanese speaking the way they do in real life. The dialogues are given in Japanese script (with furigana over all kanji), romanization, and English translation. Each example of onomatopoeia that appears in the dialogue has its own commentary, including definitions, usage, and two or more sample sentences. Cultural notes are given when they help to clarify the situation presented in the dialogue. Each dialogue is followed by a quiz. With its edifying introduction and lively dialogues, Jazz Up Your Japanese with Onomatopoeia: For All Levels will, without a doubt, help students come to grips with this intriguing aspect of the Japanese language, whether they be intermediate students who can benefit from seeing onomatopoeia used in a variety of situations or beginning students who, as they slowly add new onomatopoeia to their vocabulary, will profit from seeing how these words fit into a larger, fully developed scheme. The book will also, whatever the level, make Japanese much more fun to study. Previously published in Kodansha International s Power Japanese series under the title Flip, Slither, & Bang: Japanese Sound and Action Words (1993). Now with a new introduction and quizzes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7aJNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Jazz+Up+Your+Japanese+with+Onomatopoeia:+For+All+Levels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Common Sense of Teaching Reading and Writing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vnCISQAACAAJ&dq=Common+Sense+of+Teaching+Reading+and+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ILL Met By Moonlight","description":"NOW WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY W.

Now a correspondent for National Public Radio, Adler was a young woman determined to be taken seriously and to be an agent of change on her own terms, free from dogma and authoritarian constraints. From campus activism at the University of California at Berkeley to civil rights work in Mississippi, from antiwar protests to observing the socialist revolution in Cuba, she found those chances in the 1960s. Heretic s Heart illuminates the events, ideas, passions, and ecstatic commitments of the decade like no other memoir. At the book s center is the powerful and unique correspondence between Adler, then an antiwar activist at Berkeley, and a young American soldier fighting in Vietnam. The correspondence begins when Adler reads a letter the infantryman has written to a Berkeley newspaper.  I ve heard rumors that there are people back in the world who don t believe this war should be. I m not positive of this though,  cause it seems to me that if enough of them told the right people in the right way, then something might be done about it. . . . You see, while you re discussing it amongst each other, being beat, getting in bed with dark-haired artists . . . some people here are dying for lighting a cigarette at night.  Heretic s Heart also explores Adler s attempt to come to terms with her singular legacy as the only grandchild of Alfred Adler, collaborator of Freud and founder of Individual Psychology, and as the daughter of a forceful beauty who bequeaths her spunk and adventurousness to her daughter, but whose overpowering personality forces Adler to strike out on her own. Adler s memoir marks an initiatory journey from spirit through politics and revolution back to spirit again. Revealing, funny, joyful, and often wise, Heretic s Heart will restore the spirit of the 1960s: the passion, the confusion, the sense of social transformation and limitless possibility, and the ecstatic feeling that the world is on the cusp of change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-YoDAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Newberry Reference Bible: Single Column Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vxUdPQAACAAJ&dq=Newberry+Reference+Bible:+Single+Column+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature Form & Spirit: The Life and Legacy of George Nakashima","description":"Nature is in many different ways a pool for the productive human being, but also a counterpoint to his/her own work.

When Peter Chin moved his family into an inner-city neighborhood to plant a church, he was sure he was doing what God wanted. But in the span of a few months his family experienced a heartbreaking miscarriage, a break-in at their home, a breast cancer diagnosis, and the termination of their health insurance. Why would God allow these things to happen? But God had one more surprise prepared for the Chins: a child, conceived in the most unlikely and dangerous of circumstances, through whom Peter would realize that although God's ways were wild and strange, they were always good. Filled with twists and turns, deep insights, and surprising humor, Blindsided by God explores the reality of suffering, the mystery of God's ways, and why, even in the darkest times, there's always reason for hope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eCgtBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","description":"Flash CS4 Professional Digital Classroom is like having a personal instructor guiding readers through each lesson, while they work at their own pace.

Van Sant says we can see how badly Damon drives by watching the film's last scene, in which he is actually driving the car with the camera mounted on it. But Damon and company write better than he drives; this script contains some of the boldest, best monologues since Pulp Fiction.Van Sant and cast member Robin Williams helped the young actors tame the tigers in their cranial tanks, trimming the script into a precision instrument.

What are the real thoughts of this German people which has puzzled the world so frequently? In answer to these vital questions, Leonhard Guenther (pseud.), a native-born German doctor of philosophy and jurisprudence who emigrated to America for permanent residence, presents in A German Ace Tells Why. It contains the authentic diary entries (May 22, 1915 - September 3, 1939) of a high-ranking officer of the German Luftwaffe, who, at the time of first publication in 1942 was still in Germany. The original diary has been condensed and the author s own experiences have been added. The picture thus obtained shows both the articulate and subconscious sentiments of the typical German of the better class.  This brief but eloquent chronicle of the development of political thinking in the mind of a typical educated German during the period between the First World War and the attack by Germany upon Poland seems to me of great value to every thoughtful American. [...] The author, an ardent lover of American democracy, gives us a picture of Germany that should become a significant element in American thinking about the new order which must follow the victory of the democracies.

William Boyd follows his critically acclaimed novels A Good Man in Africa, Brazzaville Beach, and Ordinary Thunderstorms with a razor-sharp, incandescent thriller in Waiting for Sunrise. Vienna, 1913. Lysander Rief, a young English actor in town seeking psychotherapy for a troubling ailment, becomes caught up in a feverish affair with a beautiful, enigmatic woman. When she goes to the police to press charges of rape, however, he is mystified, and his few months of passion come to an abrupt end. Only a carefully plotted escape-with the help of two mysterious British diplomats-saves him from trial. But the frenzied getaway sets off a chain of events that steadily dismantles Lysander s life as he knows it. He returns to London hoping to win back his one-time fianc e and banish from memory his traumatic ordeals abroad, but Vienna haunts him at every turn. The men who helped coordinate his escape recruit him to carry out the brutal murder of a complete stranger. His lover from Vienna shows up nonchalantly at a party, ready to resume their liaison. And before he knows where his new life has taken him, Lysander soon finds himself on the trail of a traitor-a man whose bizarre connection to his own family proves a cruel twist of fate A provocative exploration of the line between consciousness and reality is nested within a tense, rollercoaster plotline following as a young English actor ensnared in a bewildering scandal with an enigmatic woman in early twentieth-century Vienna.

Beal focuses particularly on the traditionally marginalised book of Esther, in order to examine closely the categories of self and other in relation to religion, sexism, nationalism, and the ever-looming legacies and future possibilities of annihilation. Beal applies the critical tools of contemporary theorists, such as Cixous, Irigaray and Levinas, challenging widely held assumptions about the moral and life-affirming message of Scripture and even about the presence of God in the book of Esther. The Book of Hiding draws together a variety of different perspectives and disciplines, creating a unique space for dialogue raising new questions and reconsidering old assumptions, which is profoundly interesting and well-articulated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ReqGAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and the Authority of Scripture: A Narrative Approach","description":"Addresses the theological impact of accepting the absolute authority of biblical scripture and its related issues, examining how women in the church have dealt with scriptural authority while offering advice on how they can address it in the future.

In 1779, Britain strategised a war to finally subdue the rebellious American colonies with a minimum of additional time, effort, and blood. Setting sail from New York harbour with 8,500 ground troops, a powerful British fleet swung south towards South Carolina. One year later, Charleston fell. And as King George s forces pushed inland and upward, it appeared the six-year-old colonial rebellion was doomed to defeat. In a stunning work on forgotten history, acclaimed historian Walter Edgar takes the American Revolution far beyond Lexington and Concord to re-create the pivotal months in a nation s savage struggle for freedom. It is a story of military brilliance and devastating human blunders - and the courage of an impossibly outnumbered force of demoralised patriots who suffered terribly at the hands of a merciless enemy, yet slowly gained confidence through a series of small triumphs that convinced them their war could be won. Alive with incident and colour.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YYii12ln6DgC&dq=Partisans+and+Redcoats:+The+Southern+Conflict+That+Turned+the+Tide+of+the+American+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forts of the West","description":"The number and variety of forts and posts, together with changes of location, name, and designation, have posed perplexing problems for students of western history.

The lists of posts are arranged alphabetically within the boundaries of present states. Pertinent information is included for each fort: date of establishment, location, and reason for establishment; name, rank, and military unit of the person establishing the post; origin of the post name and changes in name and location; present status or date of abandonment; and disposition of any existing military reservation. A map for each state shows the location of the posts discussed.

Deluged by persuasive advertisements and meticulous (though often misguided) advice experts, women from the 1940s to the 1970s were coaxed to \\"think pink\\" when they thought of what it meant to be a woman. Attaining feminine perfection meant conforming to a mythical standard, one that would come wrapped in an adorable pink package, if those cunning marketers were to be believed. With wise humor and a savvy eye for curious, absurd, and at times wildly funny period artifacts, Lynn Peril gathers here the memorabilia of the era  from kitschy board games and lunch boxes to outdated advice books and health pamphlets and reminds us how media messages have long endeavored to shape women's behavior and self-image, with varying degrees of success. Vividly illustrated with photographs of vintage paraphernalia, this entertaining social history revisits the nostalgic past, but only to offer a refreshing message to women who lived through those years as well as those who are coming of age now.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S3lHAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential: Hieronymus Bosch (Essential (Harry N.

Practitioners of both traditional religions and new religious movements have begun to employ comics as a missionary tool, while humanists and religious progressives use comics' unique fusion of text and image to criticize traditional theologies and to offer alternatives. Addressing the increasing fervor with which the public has come to view comics as an art form and Americans' fraught but passionate relationship with religion, Graven Images explores with real insight the roles of religion in comic books and graphic novels. In essays by scholars and comics creators, Graven Images observes the frequency with which religious material in devout, educational, satirical, or critical contexts occurs in both independent and mainstream comics. Contributors identify the unique advantages of the comics medium for religious messages; analyze how comics communicate such messages; place the religious messages contained in comic books in appropriate cultural, social, and historical frameworks; and articulate the significance of the innovative theologies being developed in comics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&dq=Graven+Images&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","description":"Welcome to the world's most exciting foodscape, Spain, with its vibrant marriage of rustic traditions, Mediterranean palate, and endlessly inventive cooks.

Passive Annual Heat Storage (PAHS) is a method of collecting heat in the summertime, by cooling the home naturally, storing it in the earth naturally, then returning the heat to the home in the winter. It includes extensive use of natural heat flow methods and the arrangement of building materials to direct heat from wherever you get it to wherever you want it, all without using machinery to make it work. With the rising cost of energy, all home builders should become familiar with basic PAHS principles. The goal of Passive Annual Heat Storage is to provide a method of placing building materials and organizing construction so the comfortable environments produced are continuously pleasant.

Russell provides a history of writing instruction outside general composition courses in American secondary and higher education, from the founding of public secondary schools and research universities in the 1870s through the spread of the writing-across-the-curriculum movement in the 1980s. Russell's task is to examine the ways writing was taught in the myriad curricula that composed the varied structure of secondary and higher education in modern America. He begins with the assertion that, before the 1870s, writing was taught as ancillary to speaking. As a result, formal writing instruction was essentially training in handwriting, the mechanical process of transcribing sound to visual form. From this point, Russell carefully examines academic writing, its origins and its teaching, from a broad institutional perspective. He looks at the history of little-studied genres of student writing such as the research paper, lab report, and essay examination. Tracing the effects of increasing specialization on writing instruction, he notes how two new ideals of academic life, research and utilitarian service, shaped writing instruction into its modern forms. Finally, he contributes the definitive history of the current writing-across-the-curriculum movement, providing a study of the long tradition of other WAC efforts with an analysis of why they have waned.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_tR4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Writing+in+the+Academic+Disciplines,+1870-1990:+A+Curricular+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","description":"The Matrix trilogy is unique among recent popular films in that it is constructed around important philosophical questions--classic questions which have fascinated philosophers and other thinkers for thousands of years. Editor Christopher Grau here presents a collection of new, intriguing essays about some of the powerful and ancient questions broached by The Matrix and its sequels, written by some of the most prominent and reputable philosophers working today. They provide intelligent, accessible, and thought-provoking examinations of the philosophical issues that support the films. Philosophers Explore The Matrix includes an introduction that surveys the use of philosophical ideas in the film. Topics that the contributors tackle include: how a collaborative dream could differ from hallucination, the difference between the Matrix and the \\"real\\" world; why living in the Matrix would be considered \\"bad\\"; the similarities between the Matrix and Plato's Cave; the moral status of artificially created beings, whether one can behave immorally in illusory circumstances, and the true nature of free will and responsibility. This volume also includes an appendix of classic philosophical writing on these issues by Plato, Berkeley, Descartes, Putnam, and Nozick. Philosophers Explore The Matrix will fascinate any fan of the films who wants to delve deeper into their themes, as well as any student of philosophy who desires an accessible entry into this challenging and profoundly vital world of ideas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4Pmld5FXZ0YC&dq=The+Matrix+and+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freehand 10 f/x & Design","description":"FreeHand 10 f/x and Design features how to trace scanned images for use in printable or Web-ready illustrations.

Designed so you easily get into it. Yet, it also has depth. This truly massive book is crammed to the gills with extraordinary movies, endless characters, inspired quotes, and incendiary analysis. In one book, an entire era of films will come alive. I've tracked down all the highlights (like some rare, wild, nearly extinct beast, film noir has fi-nally been captured). If it's exciting, it's here. Nothing lame, nothing sloppy, nothing weak. It must be noted that some 50 years after the fact, film noir still remains shrouded in mystery. On the simplest level, many important films are unaccounted for (not to mention, numerous obscurities). In line with this, theories accounting for the phenomenon have been most unsatisfactory (thus some have dismissed the idea altogether). Yet, this hasn't stopped film noir from being acclaimed as the one true American 'art film' genre and as 'one of the most important cultural developments of the twentieth century'. However, noir hasn't been well-served in recent years by either the movies made in its name or the critical commentary on the subject. Now, The Film Noir Bible comes along to answer the question of whether film noir was a truly significant artistic movement or merely a bunch of mildly amusing relics which people still get a kick out of. The Film Noir Bible isn't about theory. It's about movies (I name names). I'll tell you what films are good, bad, underrated (I didn't watch all these films not to have an opinion on them). Have the movies dated? Are they flawed but interesting? All here. Plus, the book overflows with detailed descriptions of the many characters who people film noir. You won't see this in other books. Tons of unique quotes as well. All in all, it's a no-nonsense guide to the 200 or so most significant film noirs of all time (and more). When I'm thru with these sonuvabitches, you'll know them better than your next-door neighbor (in fact, you won't even need to watch the film to get a great feel for it).\\"--Amazon website.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y7dTAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Film+Noir+Bible:+When+White+People+Had+the+Blues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yellow Heart (English and Spanish Edition)","description":"Playful and irreverent, filled with improvisational spirit, Neruda delivers a book called \\"Essential\\" by Library Journal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CyJ16uLs9a4C&dq=Yellow+Heart+(English+and+Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myths of pre-Columbian America","description":"Expert discussions of such myths and mythological figures as the milk goddess and her pot symbol, the jewel-water and mugwort goddess, goddesses of love and food, Tlaloc and the dragon, love and mother deities, Quetzalcoatl, many more.

In the world of fishing there are magic phrases that are guaranteed to summon the demon. Among them are:  remote trout lake,   fish up to 13 pounds,   the place the guides fish on their days off,   writes John Gierach in this wonderful collection of thirteen essays inspired by a fishing trip to Rat Lake, a remote body of water in Montana. Once again John Gierach does what he does best explain the peculiarities of the fishing life in a way that will amuse novices and seasoned fly fishers alike. The View from Rat Lake deftly examines man in nature and nature in man, the pleasures of fishing the high country, and the high and low comedy that occasionally overcomes even the best-planned fishing trip. Some typically sage observations from The View from Rat Lake:  One of the things we truly fish for [is] an occasion for self-congratulation.   In every catch-and-release fisherman s past there is an old black frying pan.   We . . . believe that a 12-inch trout caught on a dry fly is four inches longer than a 12-inch trout caught on a nymph or streamer.

James Thompson,  The Seasons  (1727) have been investigating ball lightning for more than two decades. I published a ball lightning report in Nature in 1976 that received worldwide publicity and I consequently many people wrote to me with accounts of their own experiences. Within a very short time, I had accumulated about 200 firsthand accounts, and the file has continued to grow steadily since then. Several things impressed me. Few of those who wrote to me had any detailed foreknowledge of ball lightning at the time of their observation. Nonetheless, once reports of other phenomena such as St. Elmo s fire had been eliminated, the remaining descriptions were remarkably consistent.

In Miracle Hill, Blackhorse Mitchell presents the unforgettable account of a boy?s struggle to learn?which would be for him a miracle?in the face of handicaps most people would call insurmountable. Under the guidance of a teacher determined to help him pursue that miracle, he records his life from birth to the dawn of manhood: herding family sheep, living at a boarding school, encountering whites for the first time, journeying home, and finally enrolling in the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, where his talent was encouraged. Miracle Hill is written in a distinctively personal style, without strict adherence to orthodox grammar that would have robbed Mitchell of his true voice.

The account of Abstract Expressionism developed by the American critic Clement Greenberg is often identified as central to these efforts. However, this book rereads Greenberg's account through Theodor Adorno and Maurice Merleau-Ponty in order to contend that Greenberg's criticism in fact testifies to how Abstract Expressionism opposes the ends to which it was deployed. With reference not only to the most famous artists of the movement, but also female artists and artists of colour whom Greenberg himself neglected, such as Joan Mitchell and Norman Lewis, it is argued that, far from reinforcing the capitalist status quo, Abstract Expressionism engages corporeal and affective elements of experience dismissed or delegitimated by capitalism, and promises a world that would do justice to them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I9I-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Weight Training Journal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9hIMAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Ultimate+Weight+Training+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Retriever Puppies 2005 Wall Calendar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8u4jPQAACAAJ&dq=Golden+Retriever+Puppies+2005+Wall+Calendar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Handbook of Criminology","description":"With contributions from over 60 leading experts in the field, The Oxford Handbook of Criminology is the definitive guide to the discipline providing an authoritative and outstanding collection of chapters on the key topics studied on criminology courses.

De anti-Italiaanse stemming is op haar hoogtepunt en door de Parijse intelligentsia wordt hij met een scheef oog aangekeken. Zich zeer bewust van zijn vreemdelingenstatus en geholpen door de geografische afstand blikt Malaparte terug op zijn leven in Itali? en zijn complexe rol in de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Malapartes dagboek laat zich lezen als een gelaagd zelfportret van een schrijver die ten prooi valt aan een gevoel van vervreemding. Ook geeft het een fascinerend tijdsbeeld van een grote Europese stad vlak na de oorlog, waarin schrijvers en kunstenaars nieuw artistiek en ideologisch houvast proberen te vinden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CfiwBAAAQBAJ&dq=Paris+and+Elsewhere+(New+York+Review+Books+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Heat","description":"Weergaloos eerste deel in nieuwe trilogie van een van Amerika's grootste verhalenvertellers.

This seminal and prophetic book laid the foundation for a generation of writers on change management. This book concerns the immediate future of business, society and the economy. The one certainty about the times ahead, says Drucker, is that they will be turbulent times. In turbulent times the first task of management is to make sure of the organizations capacity for survival, to make sure of its structural strength and soundness, its capacity to survive a blow, to adapt to sudden change and to avail itself of new opportunities. The author is concerned with action rather than understanding, with decisions rather than analysis. It aims at being a practical book for the decision maker, whether in the private or the public sector.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=py8sBgAAQBAJ&dq=Managing+in+Turbulent+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maisy Cleans Up","description":"Maisy the mouse and her friend Charley clean her house together and then treat themselves to cupcakes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5HwdrNCY3xUC&dq=Maisy+Cleans+Up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet The Philosophers Of Ancient Greece: Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Ancient Greek Philosophy But Didn't Know Who To Ask","description":"Ancient Greece was the cradle of philosophy in the Western tradition.

The success of a range of parties, such as Denmark s Dansk Folskeparti, Slovenia s Slovenska demokratska stranka, France s Front National, Greece s Golden Dawn, the United Kingdom Independence Party, Beppe Grillo s Five Star Movement in Italy and the Austrian FP?, has been perceived as a political wave which is transforming the face of the European Parliament, and challenging at some level the hegemony of the 'big four' well-established European political forces that lead the Strasbourg s assembly: the ALDE, EPP, S&D and Greens/ALE. As 'populism' has become a major issue in many EU countries, this collection aims to provide a critical understanding of related trends and recommend ways in which they can be challenged both in policy and praxis, by using the gender-race-ethnicity-sexual orientation intersectionality approach.

Anne begins to worry that her husband no longer loves her but vows to make him fall for her again.

Lucy Maud Montgomery was born on 30th November 1874, New London, in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Her mother, Clara Woolner (Macneil), died before Lucy reached the age of two and so she was raised by her maternal grandparents in a family of wealthy Scottish immigrants. In 1908 Montgomery produced her first full-length novel, titled 'Anne of Green Gables'. It was an instant success, and following it up with several sequels, Montgomery became a regular on the best-seller list and an international household name.

It changed warfare by introducing the capability to project deadly, high-intensity fire on the battlefield, and portended the devastation that automatic weapons would wreak in World War I. During its 50-year career, it saw widespread service with US, British, and other forces on a host of battlefields through conflicts in Zululand and the American West, to the Spanish-American War. Although it saw widespread use in the hands of industrialized nations against various groups of indigenous native warriors, it was famously left behind by Custer at the battle of the Little Bighorn, where some argue it could have made all the difference.

Renowned for his intellectual depth and skills of plain explanation, Philip Mauro's mission in life was to enlighten his fellow Christian regarding the Biblical lore. Often members of his congregation would grow concerned or worried at not understanding aspects of the Bible; the Book of Daniel, with its dense series of prophecy, was among the commonest source of frustration for believers. Part One of this book explains the various revelations and visions of Daniel, who foresaw apocalyptic events which are collectively referred to as The Seventy Weeks. The second part of the book, discussing the prophecy of the Lord as delivered to Jesus from atop Mount Olivet, tackles the contents and clarifies the meanings of this prophetic event.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LZzYvAEACAAJ&dq=The+seventy+weeks+and+the+great+tribulation%3B:+A+study+of+the+last+two+visions+of+Daniel,+and+of+the+Olivet+discourse+of+the+Lord+Jesus+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced C/Book and Disk","description":"Here's the next step for programmers who want to improve their C programming skills. -- Complete coverage of disk files including sequential access, text, binary, and random access -- Efficient tips and techniques for debugging C programs","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9IkhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Advanced+C/Book+and+Disk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irresistible Empire: America's Advance Through Twentieth-Century Europe","description":"The most significant conquest of the twentieth century may well have been the triumph of American consumer society over Europe's bourgeois civilization. It is this little-understood but world-shaking campaign that unfolds in de Grazia's account of how the American standard of living defeated the European way of life and achieved the global cultural hegemony that is both its great strength and its key weakness today. Tracing the peculiar alliance that arrayed New World salesmanship, statecraft, and standardized goods against the Old World's values of status, craft, and good taste, de Grazia describes how all alternative strategies fell before America's consumer-oriented capitalism--first the bourgeois lifestyle, then the Third Reich's command consumption, and finally the grand experiment of Soviet-style socialist planning.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tFor1SF4tc4C&dq=Irresistible+Empire:+America%27s+Advance+Through+Twentieth-Century+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TV Typewriter Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bgq9AAAAIAAJ&dq=TV+Typewriter+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cloud forest;: A chronicle of the South American wilderness","description":"A classic work of nature and humanity, by renowned writer Peter Matthiessen (1927-2014), author of the National Book Award-winning The Snow Leopard and the new novel In Paradise Peter Matthiessen crisscrossed 20,000 miles of the South American wilderness, from the Amazon rain forests to Machu Picchu, high in the Andes, down to Tierra del Fuego and back.

At the time of its 'discovery', the American continent was identified as the Fourth World of our planet. In the course of just a few centuries its original inhabitants, though settled there for millennia and countable in many millions, have come to be perceived as a marginal if not entirely dispensable factor in the continent's destiny. Today the term has been taken up again by its native peoples, to describe their own world: both its threatened present condition, and its political history, which stretches back thousands of years before Columbus. In order to explore the literature of this world, Brotherston uses primary sources that have traditionally been ignored because they have not conformed to Western definitions of oral and written literature, such as the scrolls of the Algonkin, the knotted strings (Quipus) of the Inca, Navajo dry-paintings and the encyclopedic pages of Meso-America's screenfold books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kSY4AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Fourth+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age","description":"Alles verandert altijd is een onmisbaar instrument voor de literair vertaler in opleiding en de beginnende en gevorderde professional bij het vertalen in en uit het Nederlands.

However, little account has been given of the everyday exploitation of the idea of the world as stage in the mainstream drama of the Golden Age. This study examines how and why playwrights of the period time and again created characters who dramatize themselves, who re-invent themselves by performing new roles and inventing new plots within the larger frame of the play. The prevalence of metatheatrical techniques among Golden Age dramatists, including Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Calder n de la Barca and Guill n de Castro, reveals a fascination with role-playing and its implications. Thacker argues that in comedy, these playwrights saw role-playing as a means by which they could comment on and criticize the society in which they lived, and he reveals a drama far less supportive of the social status quo in Golden Age Spain than has been traditionally thought to be the case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sO_pSOquPdsC&dq=As+is:+A+play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oracle Designer Generation","description":"This detailed, valuable toolkit covers Designer 1.3, 2.0, and 2.1 releases, providing an overview of the entire product with a cradle to grave methodology.

The focus in these introductions is often on the four Gospels and the Letters of Paul. As important as these books are, one should not neglect, with only a brief survey, the treatment of Hebrews, the General Letters, and the book of Revelation. The title given later to the collection--Catholic Epistles or General Letters--is a reminder of its general appeal to the whole church, despite its slow \\"canonical\\" recognition and authorship issues. Nevertheless, these writings from Hebrews to Revelation continue to capture our attention and ignite our imagination. My purpose for this book is to supplement my NT introduction and others like it with a focus on specific questions about each book from Hebrews to Revelation: -When and why was each book written? -By whom and to whom was each book written? -What are some special features of each book? -How soon (or late) was each book included in the NT collection? Answers to many of these questions are tentative. The \\"assured results of scholarship\\" are in continual need of reevaluation.

There is the search for really nice standards on the part of Vi, singer at the 'Passion Fruit' nightclub - as hopelessly bemused a spirit as ever lived in sin at Earl's Court and attempted to lecture a young Communist nephew with untidy hair and spectacles. There is the humbug of the bullying new curator at the provincial Art Gallery.

Having survived the longbow devastation at Crcy, Poitiers and Agincourt, he emerged triumphant, his armor lighter and more effective, and his military skills indispensable.This was the great age of the orders of chivalry and the freemasonry of arms that bound together comrades and adversaries in a tight international military caste. Men such as Bertrand du Guesclin and Sir John Chandos loom large in the pages of this book bold leaders and brave warriors, imbued with these traditions of chivalry and knighthood. How their heroic endeavors and the knightly code of conduct could be reconciled with the indiscriminate carnage of the 'chevauche' and the depredations of the 'free companies' is one of the principal themes of this informative and entertaining book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=adhgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lenox China: Celebrating a century of quality, 1889-1989","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mTLrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lenox+China:+Celebrating+a+century+of+quality,+1889-1989&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Western Gem Hunters Atlas: Rock Locations from California to the Dakotas and British Columbia to Texas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X0ceAQAAMAAJ&dq=Western+Gem+Hunters+Atlas:+Rock+Locations+from+California+to+the+Dakotas+and+British+Columbia+to+Texas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Snow Warrior","description":"Chronicles the exploits and adventures--on and off the battlefield--of warlord Genghis Khan, and his brilliant general, Subotai","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZE-cAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Snow+Warrior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder In Scorpio (An Elizabeth Chase Mystery)","description":"Licensed Private Investigator Elizabeth Chase is used to skeptical glares and sarcastic comments when she's working on a case. Her unorthodox methods tend to surprise people: Dr. Chase is also a double-Ph.D. parapsychologist who uses her understanding of the paranormal in her investigations. Certainly some of her techniques do stand out a bit from those of the average P. I., such as her ability to see auras around witnesses or pluck important clues from her own dreams. So naturally, Escondido Police Department Sergeant Tom McGowan has some internal doubts about consulting Elizabeth on a case involving the so-called accidental death of his old high-school friend Janice Freeman. As her investiga-tions cast an increasingly suspicious light on Janice's death, Tom quickly gains more than a little respect (and affection) for Elizabeth. But the closer she gets to the truth, the less either Tom's protection or the intervention of the stars and planets may be able to keep Elizabeth out of harm's way.

After nearly a lifetime of reading Rilke in English, William Gass undertook the task of translating Rilke's writing in order to see if he could, in that way, get closer to the work he so deeply admired. With Gass's own background in philosophy, it seemed natural to begin with the Duino Elegies, the poems in which Rilke's ideas are most fully expressed and which as a group are important not only as one of the supreme poetic achievements of the West but also because of the way in which they came to be written -- in a storm of inspiration. Gass examines the genesis of the ideas that inform the Elegies and discusses previous translations. He writes, as well, about Rilke the man: his character, his relationships, his life. Finally, his extraordinary translation of the Duino Elegies offers us the experience of reading Rilke with a new and fuller understanding.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cVQTAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Wheel","description":"Oplevelser fra forfatterens turneliv med gruppen Elvis Costello and the Attractions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fj7UAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Big+Wheel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chattel Principle: Internal Slave Trades in the Americas (David Brion Davis (Gilder Lehrman))","description":"This wide-ranging book presents the first comprehensive and comparative account of the slave trade within the nations and colonial systems of the Americas.

The contributors cast new light upon questions that have framed the study of slavery in the Americas for decades. The book investigates such topics as the illegal slave trade in Cuba, the Creole slave revolt in the U.S., and the debate between pro- and antislavery factions over the interstate slave trade in the South.

As long as they are in a relationship, they need to know about these things; also it is not only for men but also for females because some women have no idea what to expect from their man. This will help them find a basic foundation of what to expect from their man, as this also helps man to know what to do for their woman. If relationships are not solved and if people are not educated about relationships, this world will never be at peace because it is all because of relationships. We have all these problems we are facing nowadays, as the world's problem started with two people who were in a relationship, which was written in the Bible. If they both knew what their responsibilities were in their relationship, the woman would have not gone and searched for food while the man was home sitting. I believe that if couples could know what they are supposed to do and what they are not supposed to do in relationship, we will make the world a better place to live.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z7BdswEACAAJ&dq=In+Him,+I+Am+Able&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Barracks","description":"'Marvellous.'

According to one ancient chronicler, they attempted a coup d'etat in the Egypt of the Ptolemy pharaohs. They sacked Rome and spread down the Iberian peninsula into northern Italy. They then moved eastward across to what is now Czechoslovakia, along the Danube valley as far as the Black Sea, and on into Asia Minor where they established the Galatian state in the third century BC.

As in the first edition, Ives's emphasis is on documenting the lives of common men and women. He offers a careful, step-by-step tour through the collection process - finding informants, making advance preparations, conducting the actual interview, obtaining a release - and then describes the procedures for processing the taped interview and archiving such materials for future use.

Startling and surprising as it will be for many Masons and Christian detractors alike, Freemasonry covertly reveres Jesus Christ, is permeated with the Sign of the Cross and is based on the Christian story.

Becker interviewed hundreds of people over a period of years; their stories are presented here in their own words. Absorbing, informative, and in many cases moving, these stories address deep-seated notions about gender, self-worth, and the cultural ideal of biological parenthood. Becker moves beyond people's personal experiences to examine contemporary meanings of technology and the role of consumption in modern life. What emerges is a clear view of technology as culture, with technology the template on which issues such as gender, nature, and the body are being rewritten and continuously altered. The Elusive Embryo chronicles the history and development of reproductive technology, and shows how global forces in consumer culture have contributed to the industry's growth. Becker examines how increasing use of reproductive technology has changed ideas about \\"natural\\" pregnancy and birth. Discussing topics such as in vitro fertilization, how men and women \\"naturalize\\" the use of a donor, and what happens when new reproductive technologies don't work, Becker shows how the experience of infertility has become increasingly politicized as potential parents confront the powerful forces that shape this industry. The Elusive Embryo is accessible, well written, and well documented. It will be an invaluable resource for people using or considering new reproductive technologies as well as for social scientists and health professionals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rxUgS5L_5hAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Watch","description":"Een Amerikaanse legerbasis in Kandahar wordt geconfronteerd met Nizam, die het lichaam van haar broer opeist om hem een islamitische begrafenis te geven.

People have often wondered what makes America truly great. With a citizenry of vastly different races, religions, cultures, and ethnic backgrounds, what intangible bond unites and defines us as \\"Americans\\"? In his own inimitable style, Chris Matthews offers a portrait of a country born of contradictions. We are a people reluctant to fight, who become ferocious when threatened or attacked. We are a deeply practical nation, yet we stand as the world's great optimists. Inherently suspicious of governmental power, we still embrace our flag in times of danger. Fiercely independent, in love with freedom, and eager to face the future, we are like no other people on earth. Matthews asserts that our greatest strength is a set of distinct notions that comprise our national character. The self-made man. The reluctant warrior. The lone hero. We celebrate them in our popular culture and throughout our history, from 1776 to 9/11. In American, Matthews explores the best America stands for and portrays our country as a beacon for the modern world -- unafraid of challenges, moving ever forward, and ready and willing to prevail.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3QPZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World War II: The Rest of the Story and How It Affects You Today : 1930 to September 11, 2001 (Uncle Eric Book)","description":"An examination of the ideas and events that led to World War II, events during the war, and how they led to subsequent wars, including the \\"war on terror,\\" written as a series of letters from a man to his niece or nephew.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OV2xAAAACAAJ&dq=World+War+II:+The+Rest+of+the+Story+and+How+It+Affects+You+Today+:+1930+to+September+11,+2001+(Uncle+Eric+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fuentes: Lectura y Redaccion- An Intermediate Course (English and Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qDF-j7S4c-cC&dq=Fuentes:+Lectura+y+Redaccion-+An+Intermediate+Course+(English+and+Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Globalisation In World History","description":"Globalization will become a major theme of historical research during the next decade - this book will help to set a new agenda.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Db4WAQAAIAAJ&dq=Globalisation+In+World+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall","description":"Arianna Kelt, is a reformed thief and wizard seer.

Focusing on the 8 central figures of exile Adam, Eve, Cain, the sons of Shem, Abraham, Rebekah, Jacob and the sons of Levy the book draws out the ethical and redemptive implications of exile and thereby paves the way for a renewed description of the human subject, one that situates ethics at its very core.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6AQ9DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visions and Dreams Divine Deck","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eVDvAgAACAAJ&dq=Visions+and+Dreams+Divine+Deck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's New World Letter Writing Handbook","description":"Expert tips and 300 sample letters make business and personal correspondence a snap.

Weinstein originally published in 1948 by the MacMillan Company in hardback. It was also republished in 1965 by Lancer in paperback. From 1948-1965 there were eight printings. It was a selection for the popular Book of the Month Club. In October 2013, BARBED-WIRE SURGEON will be republished once more by Deeds Publishing after being out of print for almost 50 years. A description of the book is best told by Dr. Weinstein himself from the Prologue.... This is a story of G.I. Joe in prison: how he lived, how he adjusted himself to life under the Nips, what he thought about and what he dreamed about. They were a motley, ragged, hungry throng. Under an ugly patina of filth and starvation, their basic individualities continued to glow feebly and occasionally to break forth into flame. Some were rugged, some were weak. As the months faded into years, the feeble faded out of the picture. In the witch's caldron of a Jap prison, G.I. Joe fought for his life with all the breaks against him. Against a somber tapestry of chronic hunger, starvation, and disease, a thin golden thread of the love of a man and woman weaves back and forth. It disappears for months and years, but is ever present. It snaps and breaks, but reappears more vibrant and glowing. Can a woman's love for her man be responsible for the survival of individuality in the face of pestilence and torture? In its broader aspects this is a tale of mankind with his veneer of civilization stripped away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_9AYngEACAAJ&dq=Barbed-Wire+Surgeon+(Lancer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where's Willie?

From the sublime to the ridiculous, he collects a treasury of information with a multitude of uses, for the conversationalist or the student of history, for the devout, the undevout or the quiz-show host.

The Dallas Times Herald The Navajo and Pueblo Silversmiths provides a full history of the craft and the actual names and localities of the pioneer craftsmen who introduced the art of the silversmith to their people.

With the nation's highest murder rate, it's a city in which half of the 41,000 residents are unemployed and 75 percent receive public assistance. In a city where most young men wind up on the streets, in jail, or dead, the high school football coach has sent dozens of his players on to college on football scholarships. He has done it with hard work and absolute dedication to virtues that went out of style in East St. Louis decades ago. He's done it by refusing to desert boys who need his attention and discipline. \\"If I don't care about them, who will?\\" he asks. This is the story of Coach Bob Shannon and the East St. Louis Flyers. It is a true story about a coach who won't give up and a team that has beaten all the odds. Author Kevin Horrigan, former sports editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, tells this story by focusing on two heartstopping seasons - 1990, when the Flyers lost the state championship, and 1991, when they won it back. He tells it from up close. We are there on the bench with the boys and their coach for every game. We follow them into the pitiful excuse for a locker room to hear the coach's credo firsthand: \\"Get it done\\". No water for the sinks, the toilets, the urinals? Try upstairs. No toilet paper? Bring your own. No money for new uniforms? Wear the old ones until they are rags. Get it done. Just get the job done. Coach Shannon has gotten the job done right for twenty-three years. In his fifteen seasons as East St. Louis High's head coach, the Flyers have won 152 of 173 games and the state championship six times. The Sporting Newshas named Shannon the High School Coach of the Year five times. This is the story of the kind of battle being waged at the core of many American cities - the power of human pride pitted against the power of poverty. In East St. Louis, pride is winning, inch by inch, with a coach and his team carrying the flag.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Kb8gsAmo68QC&dq=The+Right+Kind+of+Heroes:+Coach+Bob+Shannon+and+the+East+St.+Louis+Flyers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of Bagnell Dam","description":"Concerns the building of the Bagnell Dam.

The Myth of Santa Fe goes behind the romantic adobe facades and mass marketing stereotypes to tell the fascinating but little known story of how the city's alluring image was quite consciously created early in this century, primarily by Anglo-American newcomers. By investigating the city's trademark architectural style, public ceremonies, the historic preservation movement, and cultural traditions, Wilson unravels the complex interactions of ethnic identity and tourist image-making. Santa Fe's is a distinctly modern success story--the story of a community that transformed itself from a declining provincial capital of 5,000 in 1912 into an internationally recognized tourist destination. But it is also a cautionary tale about the commodification of Native American and Hispanic cultures, and the social displacement and ethnic animosities that can accompany a tourist boom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s5YPGERDO38C&dq=Near+Santa+Fe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Are Not Alone: A Teenager Boy's Personal Account of Child Sexual Abuse from Disclosure Through Prosecution and Treatment","description":"Any teenage boy who discloses sexual abuse is facing an emotional ordeal.

A continuous influx of new people, new ideas, new interests, and different life styles creates a mind-boggling diversity. This story covers the life of an individual who is part of that diverse mosaic - an East Coast transplant who comes to Southern California by way of the US Marine Corps and San Diego. This book is a chronology of indelible memories that begin with family life in the depression thirties and the early-on impact of Catholicism from elementary school to mid-college. It provides a unique insider s view of life in a near monastic setting when the author, at age 15, commits himself to a religious order. Leaving the order in mid-college, he joins another highly disciplined organization  the United States Marine Corps where, as both an enlisted man and officer, he sheds the earlier mold of the religious life. After military service, years of mainstream jobs follow including city halls, county government, and aerospace - all blended with a heavy dose of politics and teaching. His engagement with entrepreneurial undertakings follows with responses to critical needs such as jobs for displaced aerospace engineers when space programs are cutback, creation of a charter school to meet the need for better public schools, and his expansion of academic programs to engage older Americans in mentally stimulating and life enhancing learning experiences. All these experiences are couched within the context of events that highlighted each decade. This multifaceted career takes its toll on a marriage of thirty years whose continuity has been sustained in large measure through a family- shared hobby of dancing. But even dancing can t hold together the strains put on a marriage by a roller coaster life of continuous change. Divorce and the premature death of 3 of 4 children mar a life absorbed with programs designed to benefit the community. Despite these losses, the author continues to lead, teach, and dance. This book reflects so many facets of southland life that many readers, especially long time residents of Southern California, will identify with one or more aspects  the military, former aerospace workers, city workers, teachers, and the retirement community. It provides a unique overview of Southern California s dance scene especially in the Los Angeles-Orange County-San Bernardino/Riverside, and San Diego areas. Dancing has long been central to the author s family - ballroom, country, folk, and swing. The hobby continues to fuel the author s energy and pleasure. To those in or about to enter the expanding ranks of America s seniors, the author sets an example of an age-impervious effort to enhance a community s learning resources. His current efforts involve formation of a senior think tank whose analyses of current events will be shared with schools and the community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BifHBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!","description":"Theoretische en praktische handleiding voor leerkrachten in het basisonderwijs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kpuE6tjUypQC&dq=Your+Handwriting+Can+Change+Your+Life!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ronald Reagan: Our Fortieth President (Spirit of America: Our Presidents)","description":"Don t miss one of our greatest presidents  bestselling autobiographies in his own words. Ronald Reagan s story is a work of major historical importance, a narrative that The Washington Times calls  one of our classic American success stories.  Few presidents have accomplished more, or been so effective in changing the direction of government in ways that are both fundamental and lasting, than Ronald Reagan. Certainly no president has more dramatically raised the American spirit, or done so much to restore national strength and self-confidence. Here, then, is a truly American success story a great and inspiring one. From modest beginnings as the son of a shoe salesman in Tampico, Illinois, Ronald Reagan achieved first a distinguished career in Hollywood and then, as governor of California and as president of the most powerful nation in the world, a career of public service unique in our history. Ronald Reagan s account of that rise is told here with all the uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit that made him perhaps the most able communicator ever to occupy the White House, and also with the sense of drama of a gifted natural storyteller. He tells us, with warmth and pride, of his early years and of the elements that made him, in later life, a leader of such stubborn integrity, courage, and clear-minded optimism. Reading the account of this childhood, we understand how his parents, struggling to make ends meet despite family problems and the rigors of the Depression, shaped his belief in the virtues of American life the need to help others, the desire to get ahead and to get things done, the deep trust in the basic goodness, values, and sense of justice of the American people virtues that few presidents have expressed more eloquently than Ronald Reagan. With absolute authority and a keen eye for the details and the anecdotes that humanize history, Ronald Reagan takes the reader behind the scenes of his extraordinary career, from his first political experiences as president of the Screen Actors Guild (including his first meeting with a beautiful young actress who was later to become Nancy Reagan) to such high points of his presidency as the November 1985 Geneva meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, during which Reagan invited the Soviet leader outside for a breath of fresh air and then took him off for a walk and a man-to-man chat, without aides, that set the course for arms reduction and charted the end of the Cold War. Here he reveals what went on behind his decision to enter politics and run for the governorship of California, the speech nominating Barry Goldwater that first made Reagan a national political figure, his race for the presidency, his relations with the members of his own cabinet, and his frustrations with Congress. He gives us the details of the great themes and dramatic crises of his eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, from Iran-Contra to the visits abroad that did so much to reestablish the United States in the eyes of the world as a friendly and peaceful power. His narrative is full of insights, from the unseen dangers of Gorbachev s first visit to the United States to Reagan s own personal correspondence with major foreign leaders, as well as his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family and the enduring love between himself and Mrs. Reagan. An American Life is a warm, richly detailed, and deeply human book, a brilliant self-portrait, a significant work of history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l9htlAEACAAJ&dq=Ronald+Reagan:+Our+Fortieth+President+(Spirit+of+America:+Our+Presidents)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meridiano De Sangre / Blood Meridian (Spanish Edition)","description":"Una impresionante e imaginativa f bula moral acerca de la naturaleza de la violencia y la justicia.

One of the most characteristic features of Luther s approach to Scripture was his resolved christological interpretation of the Bible. Many of the Reformer s interpreters have looked back upon Luther s  Christ-centered  exposition of the Scriptures with sentimentality but have often labeled it as  Christianization,  particularly in regards to Luther s approach of the Old Testament, dismissing his relevance for today s faithful readers of God s Word. This study revisits this assessment of Luther s christological interpretation of Scripture by way of critical analysis of the Reformer s  prefaces to the Bible  that he wrote for his translation of the Scriptures into the German vernacular. This work contends that Luther foremost believes Jesus Christ to be the sensus literalis of Scripture on the basis of the Bible s messianic promise, not enforcing a dogmatic principle onto the scriptural text and its biblical authors that would be otherwise foreign to them. This study asserts that Luther s exegesis of the Bible s  letter  (i.e., his engagement with the biblical text) is primarily responsible for his conviction that Christ is Holy Scripture s literal sense.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cfctDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Shackles","description":"I've read and studied the history of slavery most of my life.

Unfortunately, the unthinkable happens and both Charlotte and her baby die in childbirth, leaving the age old problem of succession. For though King George III has many children, all are middle-aged and none have legitimate heirs to secure the Hanoverian dynasty. The death of Charlotte causes a sudden enthusiasm for marriage among the sons of George III, as they compete to have children and secure their line of succession. William marries Adelaide of Saxe-Coburg Meiningen while Edward marries Victoria Mary Louisa of Saxe-Saalfeld-Coburg. Another son, Ernest, is already married and he too hopes to be the one to provide necessary children. King George dies, to be replaced by an ailing George IV, and Edward and Victoria succeed in having a daughter, also named Victoria.

This book also reveals how Israel's history and Judaic festivals relate to the New Testament book of Revelation, revealing the Antichrist as a resurrected military leader and clone (possibly Adolf Hitler) who offers the world a counterfeit immortality through cloning. It also exposes the false sense of security that the church's false prophets are capitalizing on. Believers will go through another World War, which is the beginning of birth pangs Jesus prophesied about, to test the church by separating the true and false Christians. The focus of this book is to prepare believers by producing a deep spiritual growth, increasing their faith and knowledge in God, the Divine Author of the entire Bible. If that is too long the following is a condensed description.

Four of these have already been treated at length by the Swami Vivekananda in his works on \\"Raja Yoga,\\" \\"Karma Yoga,\\" \\"Bhakti Yoga,\\" and \\"Jnana Yoga\\"; but there existed no short and consecutive survey of the science as a whole. It is to meet this need that the present volume has been written. In an introductory chapter are set forth the true province of religion and the full significance of the word \\"spirituality\\" as it is understood in India. Next follows a comprehensive definition of the term \\"Yoga,\\" with short chapters on each of the five paths to which it is applied, and their respective practices. An exhaustive exposition of the Science of Breathing and its bearing on the highest spiritual development shows the fundamental physiological principles on which the whole training of Yoga is based; while a concluding chapter, under the title \\"Was Christ a Yogi?\\" makes plain the direct relation existing between the lofty teachings of Vedanta and the religious faiths of the West. An effort has been made, so far as possible, to keep the text free from technical and Sanskrit terms; and the work should therefore prove of equal value to the student of Oriental thought and to the general reader as yet unfamiliar with this, one of the greatest philosophical systems of the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jCRdEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sherbrooke Twins (Bride Series)","description":"The romantic adventures of the members of the Sherbooke family continue in the story of twin brothers James and Jason Sherbrooke.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n2VhCiHgUEwC&dq=The+Sherbrooke+Twins+(Bride+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chilton's Auto Repair Manual 1964-71","description":"Each edition includes information for that year and several previous years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8HAbAQAAMAAJ&dq=Chilton%27s+Auto+Repair+Manual+1964-71&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historical Criticism of the Bible","description":"A former liberal scholar and student of Rudolph Bultmann and Ernst Fuchs tells how modern biblical scholarship has drifted far from the truth, and why its assumptions are nonetheless so influential and thereby dangerous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gVfFwAEACAAJ&dq=Historical+Criticism+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunting al Qaeda: A Take-No-Prisoners Account of Terror, Adventure, and Disillusionment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6SuBNAEACAAJ&dq=Hunting+al+Qaeda:+A+Take-No-Prisoners+Account+of+Terror,+Adventure,+and+Disillusionment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"strange evil","description":"On the banks of the magical mountain. . . was a land of flying Satyrs and humanlike fairies -- a battleground, where the two tribes of the Mountain fought for power.

His father wanted him to become a naval engineer.

Nowhere are the new and old more intertwined, as familiar narratives of the past and radical visions of the future inform our attempts to assess the impact of cyberspace on self and society. Amidst the dizzying pace of technological innovation, Annette N. Markham embarks on a unique, ethnographic approach to understanding internet users by immersing herself in on-line reality. The result is an engrossing narrative as well as a theoretically engaging journey. A cast of characters, the reflexive author among them, emerge from Markham's interviews and research to depict the complexity and diversity of internet realities. While cyberspace is hyped as a disembodied cultural arena where physical reality can be transcended, Markham finds that to understand how people experience the internet, she must learn how to be embodied there_a process of acculturation and immersion which is not so different from other anthropological projects of cross-cultural understanding. Both new and not-so-new, cyberspace provides a context in which we can ask new sorts of questions about all cultural experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FjChjmaibngC&dq=Life+Online:+Researching+Real+Experience+in+Virtual+Space+(Ethnographic+Alternatives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A land","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wzFNAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zombie School (Give Yourself Goosebumps, No 40)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lplYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Zombie+School+(Give+Yourself+Goosebumps,+No+40)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Parian Phenomenon: A Survey of Victorian Parian Porcelain, Statuary,","description":"A comprehensive illustrated catalogue of Parian made by major manufacturers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xM5wQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Parian+Phenomenon:+A+Survey+of+Victorian+Parian+Porcelain,+Statuary,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Just Forgot","description":"Original publication and copyright date: 1988.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qIBdPwAACAAJ&dq=I+Just+Forgot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eden","description":"1876.

The New York Times Book Review  Strikes the perfect balance of brutally honest and laugh out loud funny. I didn t want it to end.   Mindy Kaling, New York Times bestselling author of Why Not Me? With sharp, timely insight, pitch-perfect pop culture references, and her always unforgettable voice, New York Times bestselling author, comedian, actress, and producer Phoebe Robinson is back with her most must-read book yet. In her brand-new collection, Phoebe shares stories that will make you laugh, but also plenty that will hit you in the heart, inspire a little bit of rage, and maybe a lot of action. That means sharing her perspective on performative allyship, white guilt, and what happens when white people take up space in cultural movements; exploring what it s like to be a woman who doesn t want kids living in a society where motherhood is the crowning achievement of a straight, cis woman s life; and how the dire state of mental health in America means that taking care of one s mental health aka  self-care  usually requires disposable money. She also shares stories about her mom slow-poking before a visit with Mrs. Obama, the stupidly fake reassurances of zip-line attendants, her favorite things about dating a white person from the UK, and how the lack of Black women in leadership positions fueled her to become the Black lady boss of her dreams. By turns perceptive, laugh-out-loud funny, and heartfelt, Please Don t Sit on My Bed in Your Outside Clothes is not only a brilliant look at our current cultural moment, it's also a collection that will stay with readers for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OyIfEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","description":"An analytical framework for explaining the ways in which institutions and institutional change affect the performance of economies is developed in this analysis of economic structures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oFnWbTqgNPYC&dq=Institutions,+Institutional+Change+and+Economic+Performance+(Political+Economy+of+Institutions+and+Decisions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going To The Zoo","description":"Daddy's taking us to the zoo tomorrow, zoo tomorrow, zoo tomorrow.

Are you bored with the old Christian answers that leave you in doubt? Are you tired of statements from scientists like, \\"God is a matter of faith and not something provable with science?\\" Are you tired of statements from all kinds of people like, \\"Faith is a personal thing and everyone should have their own?\\" Are you tired of statements from pastors like, \\"Christ gives us hope to carry on.\\" Well here's some refreshing news for you. Something is wrong with the way scientists and Christians view the cosmos and Jesus Christ. Our modern industrial society has accepted an idea that is more erroneous than Ptolemy's geocentric theory (127 AD) that the Earth was the center of the universe and the Sun and stars moved around it. Astronomers and Christians alike now believe in error that heaven is in another dimension. Many scientists believe in error that energy is the life force of the cosmos. Christians believe in error that Jesus only operated on the human heart. Scientists and Christians alike are looking for extraterrestrial intelligence and have passed over and dismissed the comprehensive cosmic operation that renders the human race superior to all life forms on earth and to the most distant galaxy. We are hyperspace aliens with the answers to all the problems in the cosmos and we know how to get along and survive forever in the stars of heaven. You will soon know this beyond doubt and become a different type of being capable of eternal space travel at the speed of desire.

Even a decade after his death, the attendance records he set at Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl, and Radio City Music Hall still stand. Arguably the most popular entertainer of the twentieth century, this very public figure nonetheless kept more than a few secrets. Darden Asbury Pyron, author of the acclaimed and bestselling Southern Daughter: The Life of Margaret Mitchell, leads us through the life of America's foremost showman with his fresh, provocative, and definitive portrait of Liberace, an American boy. Liberace's career follows the trajectory of the classic American dream. Born in the Midwest to Polish-Italian immigrant parents, he was a child prodigy who, by the age of twenty, had performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Abandoning the concert stage for the lucrative and glittery world of nightclubs, celebrities, and television, Liberace became America's most popular entertainer. While wildly successful and good natured outwardly, Liberace, Pyron reveals, was a complicated man whose political, social, and religious conservativism existed side-by-side with a lifetime of secretive homosexuality. Even so, his swishy persona belied an inner life of ferocious aggression and ambition. Pyron relates this private man to his public persona and places this remarkable life in the rapidly changing cultural landscape of twentieth-century America. Pyron presents Liberace's life as a metaphor, for both good and ill, of American culture, with its shopping malls and insatiable hunger for celebrity. In this fascinating biography, Pyron complicates and celebrates our image of the man for whom the streets were paved with gold lam . \\"An entertaining and rewarding biography of the pianist and entertainer whose fans' adoration was equaled only by his critics' loathing. . . . [Pyron] persuasively argues that Liberace, thoroughly and rigorously trained, was a genuine musician as well as a brilliant showman. . . . [A]n immensely entertaining story that should be fascinating and pleasurable to anyone with an interest in American popular culture.\\" Kirkus Reviews \\"This is a wonderful book, what biography ought to be and so seldom is.\\" Kathryn Hughes, Daily Telegraph \\"[A]bsorbing and insightful. . . . Pyron's interests are far-ranging and illuminating-from the influence of a Roman Catholic sensibility on Liberace and gay culture to the aesthetics of television and the social importance of self-improvement books in the 1950s. Finally, he achieves what many readers might consider impossible: a persuasive case for Liberace's life and times as the embodiment of an important cultural moment.\\" Publishers Weekly \\"Liberace, coming on top of his amazing life of Margaret Mitchell, Southern Daughter, puts Darden Pyron in the very first rank of American biographers. His books are as exciting as the lives of his subjects.\\" Tom Wolfe \\"Fascinating, thoughtful, exhaustive, and well-written, this book will serve as the standard biography of a complex icon of American popular culture.\\" Library Journal","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RCSkGd_2zRIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prochain episode","description":"A Certain Difficulty of Being provides an English-speaking audience with an account of some of the most interesting narrative problems which mark the development of the Quebec novel.

C. 16 At the time when this Work was commenced, Mr. Ballantine's Treatise on the Statute of Limitations, was the only Book of the kind; but that, although deservedly esteemed as a valuable Publication, had been rendered partially inaccurate, by Decisions made in the English Courts, since it was written, modifying and altering in some essential particulars, what had previously been considered as the settled construction of the Law on that subject. Of the venous important Decisions of the American Courts, upon the Limitation of Actions, it was believed that no collection or arrangement had been attempted. The advantage to be derived from a knowledge of recent English Adjudications, is too obvious to require any remark; nor can the peculiar importance of the Amarican Authorities, to Practitioners in the Courts of this Country, be a matter of doubt: and as the Editor of this Edition had been taught by ac tual experience, how great an expense of time and labour, was incurred, in searching through nearly three hundred Volumes, to extract the Law on this subject, he was induced to believe that a new Edition of Mr. Ballantine's Treatise, with notes of the Decisions made by the English Courts since that Treatise was written, together with notes of the Decisions, made in all those of the United States, which have caused the Proceedings of their Courts to be reported, would not be considered by his brethren of the Bar, as either useless or unacceptable.

The Economist (2013 Book of the Year) Leonard Bernstein was a charismatic and versatile musician a brilliant conductor who attained international superstar status, and a gifted composer of Broadway musicals (West Side Story), symphonies (Age of Anxiety), choral works (Chichester Psalms), film scores (On the Waterfront), and much more. Bernstein was also an enthusiastic letter writer, and this book is the first to present a wide-ranging selection of his correspondence. The letters have been selected for the insights they offer into the passions of his life musical and personal and the extravagant scope of his musical and extra-musical activities. Bernstein s letters tell much about this complex man, his collaborators, his mentors, and others close to him. His galaxy of correspondents encompassed, among others, Aaron Copland, Stephen Sondheim, Jerome Robbins, Thornton Wilder, Boris Pasternak, Bette Davis, Adolph Green, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and family members including his wife Felicia and his sister Shirley. The majority of these letters have never been published before. They have been carefully chosen to demonstrate the breadth of Bernstein s musical interests, his constant struggle to find the time to compose, his turbulent and complex sexuality, his political activities, and his endless capacity for hard work. Beyond all this, these writings provide a glimpse of the man behind the legends: his humanity, warmth, volatility, intellectual brilliance, wonderful eye for descriptive detail, and humor.

In the new country  a land of opportunity  they found a very different form of social hierarchy, one that was based on the color of a person s skin. Noel Ignatiev s 1995 book  the first published work of one of America s leading and most controversial historians  tells the story of how the oppressed became the oppressors; how the new Irish immigrants achieved acceptance among an initially hostile population only by proving that they could be more brutal in their oppression of African Americans than the nativists.

Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf","description":"When Virginia Woolf first met Vita Sackville-West at Clive Bell's home in 1922, she wrote that Vita made her feel 'virgin, shy, & schoolgirlish'. But over the next three years Vita charmed away her shyness, and at the end of 1925 made Virginia her lover. Vita and Virginia examines the creative intimacy between the two women, interpreting both their relationship and their work in the light of their experience as married lesbians. The contradictions and conflicts of their situation are worked out through the construction of different narratives of femininity, in letters, novels, diaries, and other texts. The book discusses the two women's continual renegotiation of what it means to be female, and suggests that the mutual exchange of different versions of womanhood is crucial to the development of their friendship. Vita and Virginia offers innovative readings of both women's fiction, their autobiographical texts, and a long-overdue study of Sackville-West's work as a biographer and novelist. Emphasizing wider contexts, Suzanne Raitt assesses the links between homosexual desire and literary innovation, public politics and private lives. Her work provides an invaluable new perspective on the relations between sexuality and feminism in modernism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yCiVzQEACAAJ&dq=Vita+and+Virginia:+The+Work+and+Friendship+of+V.+Sackville-West+and+Virginia+Woolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And Falsely Pledge My Love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k1c9ugAACAAJ&dq=And+Falsely+Pledge+My+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tanakh akhshav (Hebrew Edition)","description":"What do Jews think scripture is?

They address why different Jewish thinkers, writers, and communities have turned to the Bible and what they expect to get from it. Ultimately, argues editor Benjamin D.

Set in the Victorian era, it is considered unusual and even shameful for a woman to participate in the workforce, but when Brooke proves her ability, no man can deny or ignore her talent. Beginning a career as a detective, Brooke becomes the go-to police consultant for any case that seems unsolvable. The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective is a collection of seven short stories, each portraying an individual mystery, varying crimes and intrigue. The Black Bag on the Doorstep is the first title in the collection, and follows a Christmas Eve robbery. Featuring a more heinous crime, The Murder at Troyte's Hill depicts a murder mystery after a local lodge-keeper is found dead in a ransacked room. Challenged with one of her most puzzling mysteries, Brooke attempts to find a young girl who vanished without a trace in the fan-favorite story, Missing. Unable to find a lead even after ten days of searching, the police are ready to give up, but Loveday Brooke is determined to reunite the girl with her family. With an original approach to the mystery genre, The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective was among Catherine Louisa Pirkis' most popular work. Often compared to Sherlock Holmes, Loveday Brooke remains to be a beloved and memorable character from the detective fiction genre, and is one of the earliest depictions of a woman working in the detective field in literature. With mysteries ranging from crimes of theft, murder, kidnap, and conspiracy, The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective provides a fun and fresh reading experience, as it has remained to be progressive and intriguing nearly one-hundred and thirty years after its original publication. This edition of The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective by Catherine Louisa Pirkis is now available in an easy-to-read font, and features a new, eye-catching cover design. With these accommodations, The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective is restored to modern standards while the original mastery of Catherine Louisa Pirkis' work is preserved.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hTVHzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Experiences+of+Loveday+Brooke-+Lady+Detective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A few reasons for doubting the inspiration of the Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ccd_swEACAAJ&dq=A+few+reasons+for+doubting+the+inspiration+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","description":"Chapter by chapter the reader is taken gently from the basics of the big jets to the sophistication of the 'glass cockpit' in preparation for the pilot's seat on a Boeing 777 flight from London to Boston.

The forces of economic modernity -- specialization, mechanization, and improved efficiency -- swept through southern farm communities, leaving significant upheaval in their wake. In an attempt to comprehend the complexities of the present and prepare for the uncertainties of the future, many southern farmers searched for order and meaning in their memories of the past. In Southern Farmers and Their Stories, Melissa Walker explores the ways in which a diverse array of farmers remember and recount the past. The book tells the story of the modernization of the South in the voices of those most affected by the decline of traditional ways of life and work. Walker analyzes the recurring patterns in their narratives of change and loss, filling in gaps left by more conventional political and economic histories of southern agriculture. Southern Farmers and Their Stories also highlights the tensions inherent in the relationship between history and memory. Walker employs the concept of \\"communities of memory\\" to describe the shared sense of the past among southern farmers. History and memory converge and shape one another in communities of memory through an ongoing process in which shared meanings emerge through an elaborate alchemy of recollection and interpretation. In her careful analysis of more than five hundred oral history narratives, Walker allows silenced voices to be heard and forgotten versions of the past to be reconsidered. Southern Farmers and Their Stories preserves the shared memories and meanings of southern agricultural communities not merely for their own sake but for the potential benefit of a region, a nation, and a world that has much to learn from the lessons of previous generations of agricultural providers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CG_tCwF32UAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rustler: A Tale of Love and War in Wyoming","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KPL_MgEACAAJ&dq=The+Rustler:+A+Tale+of+Love+and+War+in+Wyoming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WHEELS ON THE BUS.

Jeffrey Weinstock analyzes this tradition as an essentially feminist attempt to imagine alternatives to a world of limited possibilities. In the process, he recovers the lives and works of authors who were important during their lifetimes and in the development of the American literary tradition, but who are not recognized today for their contributions. Between the end of the Civil War and roughly 1930, hundreds of uncanny tales were published by women in the periodical press and in books. These include stories by familiar figures such as Edith Wharton, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, as well as by authors almost wholly unknown to twenty-first-century readers, such as Josephine Dodge Bacon, Alice Brown, Emma Frances Dawson, and Harriet Prescott Spofford. Focusing on this tradition of female writing offers a corrective to the prevailing belief within American literary scholarship that the uncanny tale, exemplified by the literary productions of Irving, Poe, and Hawthorne, was displaced after the Civil War by literary realism. Beyond the simple existence of an unacknowledged tradition of uncanny literature by women, Scare Tactics makes a strong case that this body of literature should be read as a specifically feminist literary tradition. Especially intriguing, Weinstock demonstrates, is that women authors repeatedly used Gothic conventions to express discontentment with circumscribed roles for women creating types of political intervention connected to the broader sphere of women's rights activism. Paying attention to these overlooked authors helps us better understand not only the literary marketplace of their time, but also more familiar American Gothicists from Edgar Allan Poe to Shirley Jackson to Stephen King.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F1YHHLa2owkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","description":"A fan favorite from USA TODAY bestselling author Victoria Dahl. Some men are off-limits. Close friends of your ex-husband, for instance. Or firefighters who work in the same building as you. Yet despite her best judgment, librarian Lauren Foster can't help noticing fire captain Jake Davis whenever he jogs by shirtless. They've always been friends, but all it takes is one not-so-chance meeting at a local bar and one not-quite-innocent walk home to ignite a fierce, uncontrollable desire between them. Widower Jake Davis has tried to ignore the spark he feels whenever Lauren's around, but once he sees her curves in a little black dress, there's no turning back. No matter how often she says she's all wrong for him, the sexy, outspoken divorc e is driving him wild in the best possible way. Maybe she's just blowing off steam. Or maybe he can convince her to fan these flames into something deeper, hotter and truer than they ever expected .

No attempt is made to describe how the lines should be measured; the intent is rather to furnish suggestions as to the method of locating the line to be measured -- in short, finding it.

Maar sinds de publicatie van Bertrand Russell's standaardwerk Geschiedenis van de westerse filosofie in 1945 is er niet meer zo'n allesomvattend werk meer verschenen over de geschiedenis van deze intellectuele reis. Met De geschiedenis van de filosofie brengt filosoof en hoogleraar A.C. Grayling daar verandering in. Met zijn kenmerkende helderheid en finesse neemt hij de lezer mee van de wereldbeschouwingen en moralen van voor Boeddha, Confucius en Socrates, langs de christelijke overheersing van het Europese gedachtegoed, naar de renaissance en de verlichting, tot aan Nietzsche, Sartre en de filosofie van vandaag de dag. En aangezien de geschiedenis van de filosofie niet compleet is zonder de grote filosofische stromingen uit India, China en de Perzisch-Arabische wereld geeft hij ook hiervan een gedetailleerd overzicht. Grayling behandelt een breed scala aan onderwerpen, waaronder de metafysica, ethiek, esthetiek en logica. Dit doet hij aan de hand van het gedachtegoed van een groot aantal befaamde filosofen evenals minder bekende maar zeer invloedrijke denkers. Tevens gaat hij dieper in op de vraag wat we van dit geheel aan stromingen hebben geleerd,  n op welke vlakken we nog vooruitgang kunnen boeken. Het resulteert in een toegankelijke maar complete geschiedenis die de ogen doet openen. 'Als er iets bestaat als de Briste variant van \\"De denker\\", dan is dat zonder twijfel A.C. Grayling.' The Times 'Vijf minuten hierin lezen leidt de hele dag tot interessante overpeinzingen.' Independent Professor A.C. Grayling is het hoofd van het New College of the Humanities in Londen en fellow van St Anne's College, Oxford. Hij schreef en redigeerde meer dan dertig boeken over filosofie en andere onderwerpen en heeft zich tevens gespecialiseerd in niet-westerse filosofie. Daarnaast schreef hij jarenlang columns voor The Guardian en The Times en was hij voorzitter van de Man Booker Prize van 2014.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CxKgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David Gentleman's India","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4K96QgAACAAJ&dq=David+Gentleman%27s+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fury","description":"'Storm and Fury' is het eerste deel van de bloedstollende Harbinger-serie van Jennifer L.

Appropriate for all levels of expertise, the book provides the knowledge and tools required to conduct a human error analysis of accidents, regardless of operational setting (i.e. military, commercial, or general aviation). The book contains a complete description of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), which incorporates James Reason's model of latent and active failures as a foundation. Widely disseminated among military and civilian organizations, HFACS encompasses all aspects of human error, including the conditions of operators and elements of supervisory and organizational failure. It attracts a very broad readership. Specifically, the book serves as the main textbook for a course in aviation accident investigation taught by one of the authors at the University of Illinois. This book will also be used in courses designed for military safety officers and flight surgeons in the U.S. Navy, Army and the Canadian Defense Force, who currently utilize the HFACS system during aviation accident investigations. Additionally, the book has been incorporated into the popular workshop on accident analysis and prevention provided by the authors at several professional conferences world-wide. The book is also targeted for students attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University which has satellite campuses throughout the world and offers a course in human factors accident investigation for many of its majors. In addition, the book will be incorporated into courses offered by Transportation Safety International and the Southern California Safety Institute. Finally, this book serves as an excellent reference guide for many safety professionals and investigators already in the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jitEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Aboard!: Railroad in American Life","description":"Traces the history of railroads in the United States, from the 1830s to the present, and examines their impact on the social and cultural life of the country","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V6hwOSdaPb4C&dq=All+Aboard!:+Railroad+in+American+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Popular Front Paris and the Poetics of Culture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TuzcoAEACAAJ&dq=Popular+Front+Paris+and+the+Poetics+of+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Senior Choices: Remarriage or Relationships: The Pleasures and Problems of Romantic Encounters Over Sixty","description":"Men and women living together outside of marriage is common place today. But did you know that almost 400,000 seniors are part of this group. A new book, Senior Choices----Remarriage or Relationships by Dr. Willard Burns and his wife, Peggy Burns, explains this new trend and the choices seniors are making in light of longer, healthier life spans, more money to spend and the independence to enjoy it. This new book, which acknowledges that marriage is still the most accepted lifestyle for two seniors, explores the alternatives. In doing so, it breaks down senior relationships according to the main characteristics that bring the couple together. It describes the \\"geriatric stud\\" as well as what the authors call a \\"comfort companionship.\\" Relationships are different at 60 plus because seniors are different than they were forty years earlier. They may be wiser but are usually more practical, sometimes more frugal, set in their ways, more prone to aches and pains and often in need of a nap. Any or all these characteristics may determine what type of relationship a senior may become involved in. The authors discuss many problems facing unmarried couples that are different from those that chose marriage. According to the authors, money and children are the two biggest factors preventing remarriage, but there are other stumbling blocks, too. Legal problems and deteriorating health, both physical and mental, are discussed in the context of relationships starting after the age of 60. With senior moments, cracking joints and over active bladder problems, it's not easy to start a new relationship. Is sex always a part of a new relationship? This book addresses seniors involved in sex and some of the misconceptions about their sexuality. It deals with the fears, expectations, consequences as well as the pleasures of sex at this age. The serious subject of death and burial is also mentioned. A few suggestions are given with emphasis on the fact that unmarried couples may have little to say about their partner's burial site. The book adds humor to the eccentricities of seniors in their everyday lives. For those seeking a new partner, it ends with a lengthy list of good dating tips.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2MO-wAEACAAJ&dq=Senior+Choices:+Remarriage+or+Relationships:+The+Pleasures+and+Problems+of+Romantic+Encounters+Over+Sixty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waterline: Of fathers, sons, and boats","description":"The story of a boat, in which the author comes to an understanding of time and reflection between generations, and the acceptance of love between father and son.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rsVPPgAACAAJ&dq=Waterline:+Of+fathers,+sons,+and+boats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Words: Earliest Writing from Favorite Contemporary Authors","description":"This unique literary anthology presents the childhood writings of some of America s greatest authors including Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates and more. Most kid write stories. A few of them grow up to be successful authors. Before Stephen King created Carrie, he created Jhonathan, at age nine. And before there was Rabbit Angstrom, there was Manuel Citarro, the detective in John Updike's hard-boiled mystery, written at fourteen. Before Jurassic Park, there was young Michael Crichton's story about the mysteriously wounded man lying unattended in the street. Editor Paul Mandelbaum persuaded our most popular American authors to share their childhood writings and their treasured photographs. What he's gathered is a fascinating, delightful collection of writing and early snapshots that reveal young minds at work, wrestling with early versions of ideas that were to take hold of their writings in later years. Of course, the young Madeline L'Engle would wonder about space and the meaning of eternity. Of course, Margaret Atwood would question conventional female behavior, arguing for the right to smoke cigars.

Only slowly does the full horror of his parents? death and his own experience return to Faustin.

Self-appointed  border-men  helped keep the peace. Battle-scarred and solitary, they tended to shoot first and ask questions later. One such man is Lewis Wetzel. He s resigned himself to his grim lifestyle until the beautiful Helen catches his eye. For the first time, Lewis imagines himself settling down. But then Helen is kidnapped by a band of Native American warriors. So Lewis saddles up and heads out on a rescue mission, knowing the chances he ll make it back alive are slim at best. The final book in \\"Ohio River Trilogy\\", \\"The Last Trail\\" is set in the final years of the 18th century. An exciting Western adventure with dashes of romance, it never shies away from the harsh realities of pioneer life. Zane Grey (18721939) helped shaped the mythos of the Old West. Born in Zanesville, Ohio (a town founded by his grandfather), Grey s first career was as a dentist. But he gave it up to pursue writing, going on to produce nearly 100 books. These wildly popular adventures defined many of the Western s most enduring tropes and characters, from noble lawmen to mysterious gunslingers, and made Grey a household name. His stories include \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\", \\"The Rainbow Trail\\" and \\"The Lone Star Ranger\\". Hollywood produced dozens of Zane Grey adaptations, mostly during the 1930s and 40s, starring Western icons like Gary Cooper and Randolph Scott.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bPk3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter The Great Part 3 Of 3","description":"Peter the Great (16721725), tsar of Russia for forty-three years, was a dramatic, appealing, and unconventional character.

Very real differences do exist between what is spoken and what is written in virtually every language.

Probing the complex relationship between outward appearances and inward states of profound want, it is a story that at turns is intriguing and sordid, poetic and allusive, told in a compact yet intense manner, offering a distinctive take on a society far more complicated than what Americans often gather from their televisions and newspaper headlines. Based roughly on real events, this fictional account follows its oblique protagonist as he moves through the loitering subculture found within public toilets and pornographic arcades, and, in the process, finds himself losing everything he values, including his own grip on reality. A mystery of both memory and mistaken identity, Undersurface is a starkly written, haunting novel about double lives, compulsion, and human sexuality, where secret desires lead to devastating circumstances. As the carefully crafted plot twists in ever suspenseful directions, we are drawn toward a startling, possibly unavoidable conclusion, one that resonates long after the book has been set aside. Complemented by the richly evocative imagery of artist Peter I. Chang, Mitch Cullin has once again written a subtly detailed, affecting, provocative story that explores the sometimes harsh days of a man on the run, the enigmatic pull of the taboo, and the nature of transient life amongst a growing suburban culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rnXCBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stairway to Hell: Rescuing Teens From Their Well-Planned Destruction","description":"Did you hear about 17-year-old Kelsey Megliola?
