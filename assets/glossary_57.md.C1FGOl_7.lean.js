I ain t askin  you to excuse me or forgive me. Just know I did the best I knew to do. I was just tryin  to make you tough enough to deal with the world. To stand tall among men, I knew you had to be strong and have yo  own mind.   You were preparing me for war, Grandfather.  Guy Johnson, the author of the critically acclaimed debut Standing at the Scratch Line, continues the Tremain family saga. Jackson St. Clair Tremain hasn t spoken to his grandfather King in nearly twenty years. Disgusted by the violence and bloodlust that seemed to be his grandfather s way of life, Jackson chose to distance himself from King and live a simpler life. But now King is gravely ill, and his impending death places Jackson s life as well as those of his family and friends in jeopardy. Reluctantly, Jackson travels to Mexico to see King. But after a brief reconciliation, his grandfather is assassinated, and Jackson suspects that his grandmother Serena may have had a hand in it. Jackson takes control of King s organization, and as he does, he reflects on the summers he spent in Mexico as a child and the lessons he learned there at the knee of his strong-willed, complex grandfather. In Echoes of a Distant Summer, Guy Johnson introduces us to a new hero, Jackson St. Clair Tremain, who learns that, like his grandfather, he must be willing to protect those he loves at all costs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iTDwaQLwLZQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alone","description":"Shows how changes in work, family structure, women's roles, and other factors have caused people to become increasingly disconnected from family, friends, neighbors, and democratic structures--and how they may reconnect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rd2ibodep7UC&dq=Alone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lamplighter","description":"Peppe becomes a lamplighter to help support his immigrant family in turn-of-the-century New York City, despite his papa's disapproval.

The different disciplines that research the human past in South America have long tended to treat these two great subzones of the continent as self-contained enough to be taken independently of each other. Objections have repeatedly been raised, however, to warn against imagining too sharp a divide between the people and societies of the Andes and Amazonia, when there are also clear indications of significant connections and transitions between them. Rethinking the AndesAmazonia Divide brings together archaeologists, linguists, geneticists, anthropologists, ethnohistorians and historians to explore both correlations and contrasts in how the various disciplines see the relationship between the Andes and Amazonia, from deepest prehistory up to the European colonial period. The volume emerges from an innovative programme of conferences and symposia conceived explicitly to foster awareness, discussion and co-operation across the divides between disciplines. Underway since 2008, this programme has already yielded major publications on the Andean past, including History and Language in the Andes (2011) and Archaeology and Language in the Andes (2012).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=72YHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil's Door-bell (Pentagram)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=64VsAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Devil%27s+Door-bell+(Pentagram)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Key to the Kalevala","description":"The Key to the Kalevala was originally published in Finland in 1916.

Relying almost exclusively upon recently declassified OSS and British intelligence documents and survivor interviews, it examines the transatlantic association in espionage and sabotage, guerrilla warfare and disinformation.

Ranging over a century of intimate foibles and world events, it is the true story of an outlandish family forced to abandon a life of wealth and privilege in Europe after World War II, and start anew in the United States. Within the framework of this transition played out on both sides of the Atlantic is the drama of the narrator's devotion to the unbridled pursuit of pleasure - and his wrenching discovery of a more subtle but no less compelling imperative. Endowed with a sensual predisposition from early childhood, the narrator is far too ready to subordinate personal and professional integrity to his hedonistic quest. As he is increasingly able to partake of the bounties offered by living in the United States - this Garden of Eden that has no forbidden trees - he also becomes increasingly aware of the less heralded consequences for him and millions of others of his ilk. \\"Are we doomed always to live in a world where we suffered and died because there wasn't enough,\\" he reflects ruefully, \\"or in a world where we suffered and died because we failed to learn how to handle plenitude?\\" Confessions of a Hapless Hedonist sparkles with the colorful characters of the narrator's relatives: his father, transformed by his adopted country from Mr. Count to a salesman of Exercycles; his sister Manya, a proselytizing charismatic Christian married to a hotelier on Cape Cod; his aunt Issten, exiled years ago to a penurious existence in a dilapidated chateau in France after engaging in an extra-marital affair with a noted American black to create a more compassionate world; Albrecht, Issten's long-suffering son laboring quixotically in his privileged retreat in the Austrian Tyrol to save humanity from its excesses; and Princess Stephanie, Albrecht's enchanting daughter whose relentless quest for romantic love leaves even her unconventional grandmother, Issten, aghast. There is also God, whether in the guise of the stern but just Yahweh of Abraham or Manya's gentle, ever-forgiving Jesus Christ. Beyond its distinctive autobiographical story line, Confessions of a Hapless Hedonist is an uncontrived morality tale that offers a mirror for those who would subscribe to the popular mantra of our day, \\"You only go around once; so grab all the pleasures you can!\\" The unabashed abandon of the book's first part, In Quest of Pleasure, and the emotional immediacy of the second part, In Quest of Redemption, combine to reflect the mounting clash between the unconstrained desires of our materialistic civilization and the reactive dictates of fundamentalism. The global scope of Confessions of a Hapless Hedonist implicitly offers a palatable alternative and should serve as a spiritual \\"red alert\\" at this critical juncture in history.\\"The author has succeeded in reaching a depth of feeling and expression that few writers even know about, much less arrive at.\\"- Lewis H.

Drawing both on primary sources and on the latest archaeology, the book first demonstrates that the standard account of the Great Wall is untrue and misleading and then presents a convincing new account. It begins by tracing the various walls and systems of frontier defences that existed in early Chinese history, and shows how the greatest of these achieved a mythical symbolic stature which long survived the Wall itself. A striking concluding chapter traces how the true history of the Wall was lost in the early twentieth century as it was gradually transformed into a Chinese national symbol explained through historical myth. The book is an important contribution to the history of China's defensive policy, and her ideological attitudes, and will be of interest both to students of Chinese history and of international relations in the pre-modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e4ybBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ponzi: The Incredible True Story of the King of Financial Cons (Library of Larceny)","description":"Traces Charles Ponzi's transition from an unknown, Italian immigrant to Boston's famed \\"wizard of finance,\\" describing the scams through which he paid off prior investors with subsequent investor funds and bankrolled millions before he was exposed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B_1vDwAAQBAJ&dq=Ponzi:+The+Incredible+True+Story+of+the+King+of+Financial+Cons+(Library+of+Larceny)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Clemenza di Tito","description":"The first book to be devoted to Mozart's opera, La clemenza di Tito, with historical and critical analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dOYOcMOzLVMC&dq=La+Clemenza+di+Tito&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simon & Schuster's Guide to Herbs and Spices (Nature Guide Series)","description":"Simon flees from a friendly monster with the aid of some drawing pens and a bottle of ink.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UzeNzgEACAAJ&dq=Simon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queueing Networks and Markov Chains : Modeling and Performance Evaluation With Computer Science Applications","description":"Critically acclaimed text for computer performance analysis--now in its second edition The Second Edition of this now-classic text provides a current and thorough treatment of queueing systems, queueing networks, continuous and discrete-time Markov chains, and simulation.

A panoramic experience that tells the story of Beastie Boys, a book as unique as the band itself by band members ADROCK and Mike D, with contributions from Amy Poehler, Colson Whitehead, Wes Anderson, Luc Sante, and more. The inspiration for the Emmy-nominated Apple TV+  live documentary  Beastie Boys Story, directed by Spike Jonze NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Rolling Stone ? The Guardian ? Paste Formed as a New York City hardcore band in 1981, Beastie Boys struck an unlikely path to global hip hop superstardom. Here is their story, told for the first time in the words of the band. Adam  ADROCK  Horovitz and Michael  Mike D  Diamond offer revealing and very funny accounts of their transition from teenage punks to budding rappers; their early collaboration with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin; the debut album that became the first hip hop record ever to hit #1, Licensed to Ill and the album s messy fallout as the band broke with Def Jam; their move to Los Angeles and rebirth with the genre-defying masterpiece Paul s Boutique; their evolution as musicians and social activists over the course of the classic albums Check Your Head, Ill Communication, and Hello Nasty and the Tibetan Freedom Concert benefits conceived by the late Adam  MCA  Yauch; and more. For more than thirty years, this band has had an inescapable and indelible influence on popular culture. With a style as distinctive and eclectic as a Beastie Boys album, Beastie Boys Book upends the typical music memoir. Alongside the band narrative you will find rare photos, original illustrations, a cookbook by chef Roy Choi, a graphic novel, a map of Beastie Boys  New York, mixtape playlists, pieces by guest contributors, and many more surprises. Praise for Beastie Boys Book  A fascinating, generous book with portraits and detail that float by in bursts of color . . . As with [the band s] records, the book s structure is a lyrical three-man weave. . . . Diamond s voice is lapidary, droll. Horovitz comes on like a borscht belt comedian, but beneath that he is urgent, incredulous, kind of vulnerable. . . . Friendship is the book s subject as much as music, fame and New York.

How do men really feel when their partners have sex with other men? What worries women more -- men who turn to other women for love or men who simply want sexual variety in their lives? Can the jealousy husbands and wives experience over real or imagined infidelities be cured? Should it be? In this surprising and engaging exploration of men's and women's darker passions, David Buss, acclaimed author of The Evolution of Desire, reveals that both men and women are actually designed for jealousy. Drawing on experiments, surveys, and interviews conducted in thirty-seven countries on six continents, as well as insights from recent discoveries in biology, anthropology, and psychology, Buss discovers that the evolutionary origins of our sexual desires still shape our passions today. According to Buss, more men than women want to have sex with multiple partners. Furthermore, women who cheat on their husbands do so when they are most likely to conceive, but have sex with their spouses when they are least likely to conceive. These findings show that evolutionary tendencies to acquire better genes through different partners still lurk beneath modern sexual behavior. To counteract these desires to stray -- and to strengthen the bonds between partners -- jealousy evolved as an early detection system of infidelity in the ancient and mysterious ritual of mating. Buss takes us on a fascinating journey through many cultures, from pre-historic to the present, to show the profound evolutionary effect jealousy has had on all of us. Only with a healthy balance of jealousy and trust can we be certain of a mate's commitment, devotion, and true love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M5EzujGkAn4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John is easy to please;: Encounters with the written and the spoken word","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=quLjwAEACAAJ&dq=John+is+easy+to+please%3B:+Encounters+with+the+written+and+the+spoken+word&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete round-the-world meat cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kDU-AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+complete+round-the-world+meat+cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decades of Beauty","description":"Decades of Beauty offers a unique treatment of female beauty and how it has been perceived since the end of the Victorian era.

Finding themselves in debt to the beautiful but deadly Cutlass Liz - or the butcher of Barbados, as she's otherwise known - the pirates need to raise some money fast. In a desperate race against time our heroes embark on an adventure that will take them from the shores of Nantucket to the bright lights of Las Vegas, to the ends of the earth in search of a mythical white whale, and even, perhaps, into the dark depths of madness. But hopefully they'll be home in time for tea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QOML1RYWjPMC&dq=The+Pirates!+In+an+Adventure+with+Ahab:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instructional Design in the Real World: A View from the Trenches","description":"Instructional Design in the Real World: A View from the Trenches offers guidance on how the traditional instructional design system has been used and how it must be changed to work within other systems.

With a copy of Exploring Coast Salish Prehistory in hand, they will enjoy an introduction both to archaeology in general and to sites within San Juan Island National Historic Park. The Coast Salish people inhabited the San Juans for 5,000 years. One important site on San Juan Island, Cattle Point, was a summer camp where residents engaged in fishing and shellfish harvesting. Native peoples? recollections of activities there have been confirmed by physical evidence in the form of shell middens, fish bones, and other artifacts. Another San Juan site, English Camp, was a winter village site for 2,000 years. Structural remains provide insight into how people?s lives and activities changed over time. Tools found at the site have allowed archaeologists to deduce that early residents ate camas bulbs and other plants, engaged in woodworking, weaving, fishing, and carving, and manufactured and used stone tools. Stein?s discussions of the sites and archaeological practices are enhanced by numerous illustrations. Clear photos of different types of artifacts, topographical maps, and other images help the reader to understand how people lived in the San Juans thousands of years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xYkVCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selections from the Husia: Sacred Wisdom of Ancient Egypt","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0M4EAAAACAAJ&dq=Selections+from+the+Husia:+Sacred+Wisdom+of+Ancient+Egypt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psycho Two","description":"Recently released from a mental institution, Norman Bates celebrates his freedom by murdering a nun and then heads for Hollywood where he plans bloody revenge on those who are acting out his story.

By investigating the formation of nomadic cultures, by analyzing the evolution of patterns of interaction along China's northern frontiers, and by exploring how this interaction was recorded in early Chinese historiography, this book explores the origins of the cultural and political tensions between these two civilizations through the first millennium BC. The main purpose of the book is to analyze ethnic, cultural, and political frontiers between nomads and Chinese in the historical contexts that led to their formation, and to look at cultural perceptions of 'others' as a function of the same historical process. Based on both archaeological and textual sources, this book also introduces a new methodological approach to Chinese frontier history, which combines extensive factual data with a careful scrutiny of the motives, methods, and general conception of history that informed the Chinese historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vo7TmTbE-t0C&dq=Ancient+China+and+its+Enemies:+The+Rise+of+Nomadic+Power+in+East+Asian+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide Me Through This Barren Land","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SQytAna9SXkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evelina, (Everyman's library)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EeygK-mrzgIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free-Lancing: A Guide to Writing for Magazines and Other Markets","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The arts & crafts of India & Ceylon,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vagueness: A Reader (Bradford Books)","description":"Vagueness is currently the subject of vigorous debate in the philosophy of logic and language. Vague terms-such as \\"tall\\", \\"red\\", \\"bald\\", and \\"tadpole\\"--have borderline cases (arguably, someone may be neither tall nor not tall); and they lack well-defined extensions (there is no sharp boundary between tall people and the rest). The phenomenon of vagueness poses a fundamental challenge to classical logic and semantics, which assumes that propositions are either true or false and that extensions are determinate. Another striking problem to which vagueness gives rise is the sorites paradox. If you remove one grain from a heap of sand, surely you must be left with a heap. Yet apply this principle repeatedly as you remove grains one by one, and you end up, absurdly, with a solitary grain that counts as a heap. This anthology collects papers in the field. After an introduction that surveys the field, the essays form four groups, starting with some historically notable pieces. The 1970s saw an explosion of interest in vagueness, and the second group of essays reprints classic papers from this period. The following group of papers represent current work on the logic and semantics of vagueness. The essays in the final group are contributions to the continuing debate about vague objects and vague identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uha9ugEACAAJ&dq=Vagueness:+A+Reader+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential IDL: Interface Design for COM (The DevelopMentor Series)","description":"\\"In particular, Essential IDL focuses on IDL constructs that support the efficient marshalling of data as performed by the COM interception layer.

The interviewees, ranging from major philosophers to renowned scientists, talk candidly with Blackmore about some of the key philosophical issues confronting us in a series of conversations that are revealing, insightful, and stimulating. They ruminate on the nature of consciousness (is it something apart from the brain?) and discuss if it is even possible to understand the human mind. Some of these thinkers say no, but most believe that we will pierce the mystery surrounding consciousness, and that neuroscience will provide the key. Blackmore goes beyond the issue of consciousness to ask other intriguing questions: Is there free will? (A question which yields many conflicted replies, with most saying yes and no.) If not, how does this effect the way you live your life; and more broadly, how has your work changed the way you live? Paired with an introduction and extensive glossary that provide helpful background information, these provocative conversations illuminate how some of the greatest minds tackle some of the most difficult questions about human nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MH08DwAAQBAJ&dq=Conversations+on+Consciousness:+What+the+Best+Minds+Think+about+the+Brain,+Free+Will,+and+What+It+Means+to+Be+Human&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Orange: A Tale from Ethiopia (Toucan Tales Series ; Vol. 2)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dead man in the silver market","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ7RAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dead+man+in+the+silver+market&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mu Tau Pankration: Concepts and Skills of \\"All-Powers\\" Combat (Concepts & Skills of All-Power)","description":"Greek Pankration, once the cornerstone of the early Olympic games, is the only fully documented fighting form of the preChristian era.

Three SETI scientists capture a satellite photo of the arrival of a mysterious being that has the power to alter man's future and change the course of the world. On a remote Italian mountainside, the ancient secret order of monks known as the Montiarans encounter a visitor (The Archangel Michael) whose presence could mean peace for the world or the end of days. Michael, while searching for his enemies, unknowingly risks all when he falls in love with a human woman, Charlie. Lowering his defenses and assuming temporary human form to be with her, he is mortally wounded, trapping him in his human state.. Leading his army now will surely mean his death.

Shinto is an ancient spiritual tradition, primarily practiced in Japan, which is now spreading its traditions to the western world. Its primordial rituals and traditions touch a deep chord within one's spiritual self. Shinto's focus on divinity of all beings and of all creation, on living with gratitude and humility, and on purification and lustration of one's self and environment will bring light and joy to any reader. The purpose of prayer and ritual as practiced in the Shinto tradition, is to reinsert ourselves into a divine state of being, not as a new position, but as an acknowledgement and reinforcement of what already exists. Ritual restores sensitive awareness to our relationship to the universe. Through purification and removal of impurities and blockages, we return to our innate internal brightness and cultivate a demeanor of gratitude and joy. Shinto rituals and prayers were created by ancient man over 2,000 years ago in a time when mankind was more intuitive about his relationship to this world. Because of this, the rites are archetypal and invoke deep emotion within the participants. This book of prayers will introduce the western reader to the deep spirituality of Shinto, providing explanation of the spiritual tradition and practice and providing a collection of 22 prayers for use in personal meditation and devotions.

This is a story of courage, friendship, and fate as two families face the challenges of war . . . and the magnificent stallion that will link them forever. PEGASUS Nicolas von Bingen and Alex von Hemmerle, titled members of the German aristocracy, have been best friends since childhood. Both widowers, they are raising their children Nick s two lively boys and Alex s adored teenage daughter in peace and luxury on the vast Bavarian estates that have belonged to their families for generations. While Nick indulges in more glamorous pursuits, Alex devotes himself to breeding the renowned white Lipizzaner horses that enthrall audiences throughout Europe with their ability to dance and spin on command, majestic creatures whose bloodlines are rare and priceless. But it is Nicolas s bloodline that changes everything, when his father receives a warning from a high-ranking contact inside the Wehrmacht. A secret from the past has left the family vulnerable to the rising tide of Nazism: Nick s mother, whom he never knew, was of Jewish descent. Suddenly Nicolas must flee Germany, wrenching his sons away from the only home they have known, sailing across the Atlantic for a new life in America. Their survival will depend on a precious gift from Alex, their only stake for the future: eight purebred horses, two of them stunning Lipizzaners. In Florida, where Nicolas joins the Ringling Brothers Circus, he becomes Nick Bing, with Alex s prize white stallion now named Pegasus the centerpiece of the show. In this extraordinary book, Danielle Steel tells the story of a family reinventing itself in America, while the country they left behind is engulfed in flames and madness, and men like Alex von Hemmerle are forced to make unbearable choices. Alex s daughter will find sanctuary in England. In America, Nick will find love, his sons will find a future, and their left-behind world will eventually find them. A novel of hope and sacrifice, of tragedy, challenge, and rebirth, Pegasus is a brilliant family chronicle that unfolds across half a century a masterwork from one of our most beloved writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RG-BAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dante's Divine Comedy: Paradise (v. 3)","description":"The Italian and English texts of each canto are preceded by notes on their historical, mythological, and ethical implications","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iXwRDAAAQBAJ&dq=Dante%27s+Divine+Comedy:+Paradise+(v.+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of Mathematics: Commutative Algebra Chapters 1-7","description":"This is the softcover reprint of the English translation of 1972 (available from Springer since 1989) of the first 7 chapters of Bourbaki's 'Alg bre commutative'.

Lawless and Richard L. Fox find that women, even in the highest tiers of professional accomplishment, are substantially less likely than men to demonstrate ambition to seek elective office. Women are less likely than men to be recruited to run for office. They are less likely than men to think they are qualified to run for office. And they are less likely than men to express a willingness to run for office in the future.

Dickens's story of solitary miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who is taught the true meaning of Christmas by a series of ghostly visitors, has proved one of his most well-loved works. Ever since it was published in 1843 it has had an enduring influence on the way we think about the traditions of Christmas. Dickens's other Christmas writings collected here include 'The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton', the short story from The Pickwick Papers on which A Christmas Carol was based; The Haunted Man, a tale of a man tormented by painful memories; along with shorter pieces, some drawn from the 'Christmas Stories' that Dickens wrote annually for his weekly journals.

While there is a robust body of psycholinguistic research that bears on how memory and language are related, there is no comparative study of how speakers themselves conceptualize memory as reflected in their use of language to talk about memory. This book addresses a key question: how do speakers of different languages talk about the experience of having prior experiences coming to mind ( remembering ) or failing to come to mind ( forgetting )? A complex array of answers is provided through detailed grammatical and semantic investigation of different languages, including English, German, Polish, Russian and also a number of non-Indo-European languages, Amharic, Cree, Dalabon, Korean, and Mandarin. In addition, the book calls for a broader interdisciplinary engagement by urging that cognitive semantics be integrated with other sciences of memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2l7ULfhOFaEC&dq=Culture,+Literacy,+and+Learning+English:+Voices+from+the+Chinese+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Civil War in Books.

Its three-century-long growth is founded on deep agricultural roots with a notable role in American history. Once a busy commercial and cultural center, Newtown served as the county seat of Bucks County from 1726 to 1813. Within this community resounded the shots of British raiding parties. From this small town on Christmas morning in 1776, General George Washington marched from his headquarters to join the Battle of Trenton. Over the succeeding years, Newtown was quietly transformed back into the tranquil pastoral town it once was. Despite the many changes that are now evident, traces of this historic past remain today. From the archives of the Newtown Historic Association, Historic Newtown offers the reader a unique opportunity to see everyday life in this rural community as it was at the beginning of the twentieth century. Within these photographs are many rare and never-before-published glimpses into the past of one of the oldest and most historic towns in Pennsylvania. Highlighted is the historic district of Newtown, which is the largest district in Bucks County to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In this spiritually and intellectually wise book Bruno Forte upholds the essence -- the heart and meaning -- of Christianity despite the claims of the contemporary world. In the tradition of thinkers like Feuerbach, Harnack, and Guardini, Forte restates what is unique, reliable, and universal about Christianity for our current age. After outlining in broad terms the nature of postmodernity and its challenges to traditional faith, Forte proceeds, with the voice of one intimately in love with God, to present anew what lies at the heart of genuine Christianity and why it is still good news for women and men today. Among the many books on postmodernism, this one is distinct for its conscientious dialogue with postmodern culture and its clear proclamation of meaningful faith. It will interest everyone pondering the role of Christianity in contemporary life.

It contains easy-to-read stories involving some aspect of the theme \\"anger.\\" It provides children with an awareness of differing degrees of anger and helps them explore choices for responding when they are anger. Teaches constructive coping skills to handle destructive feelings. Teaches the difference between feelings of anger and how we act out those feelings. Helps unravel confusion when inundated with overwhelming feelings. Provides tools to cope with anger constructively rather than to strike out destructively. Arms the child with coping skills for unexpected feelings, allowing him/her to win the battle against anger. Appeals to the visual learner with delightful artwork, allowing the presenter to reach children who might otherwise be missed. Each story begins with a letter of the alphabet - the first letter of both an animal's name and its behavior. A picture and short story about the character follows as well as a definition of the characteristic being described. These pictures and stories may be photocopied and distributed for younger children to color and for older students to add cartoon speech balloons. The lesson the facing page includes questions that the teacher may use to initiate discussion. It is hoped, however, that student responses and questions will lead to a more personalized dialogue with the teacher acting as a discussion facilitator. Follow-up activities conclude each lesson, and these, too may be adapted to suit the needs of the class. A resource chapter at the end of the book further explains the theme words and provides additional questions for classroom use. The stories may be read separately or can be combined into themes, such as trigger words, anger intensity words, solution words, empowering words, and feeling words. The characters in the stories are designed to help students make connections between their own actions and feelings as well as those that they may experience in other children and adults. Ray hopes that this book will challenge children's thinking and provide a nonthreatening means for them to work through feelings, behaviors, and emotions in a beneficial and enjoyable way.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M2MlAgAACAAJ&dq=The+ABC%27s+of+Anger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emerson and Vedanta, (His Comparative study series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gDsRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Middle East in International Relations: Power, Politics and Ideology (The Contemporary Middle East)","description":"The international relations of the Middle East have long been dominated by uncertainty and conflict.

The Book of Revelation is a record of the destruction of darkness now the search is ended and we may encounter the Divine. In plain language, John writes a story of mental warfare light, which is full knowledge of God; and darkness, which is the ignorance of God. When the mental warfare is ended, we have peace.

The first episode featured scenes in a science laboratory and a science teacher, and the 2020 season's finale highlighted a scientist's key role in Time Lord history.

Behind the scenes, Doctor Who's original remit was to teach children about science, and in the 1960s it even had a scientific advisor. This is the first book to explore this scientific landscape from a broad spectrum of research fields: from astronomy, genetics, linguistics, computing, history, sociology and science communication through gender, media and literature studies. Contributors ask: What sort of scientist is the Doctor? How might the TARDIS translation circuit and regeneration work? Did the Doctor change sex or gender when regenerating into Jodie Whittaker?

With the probity of an open-minded historian and the skills of a trained therapist (he is both), Strozier examines Lincoln's relationships to women: his mother, stepmother, two young loves, and Mary Todd. He also considers Lincoln's feelings toward his father and male friends and colleagues. In this psychological portrait, the reader comes closer than ever to understanding our greatest president. For this revised edition, Professor Strozier has incorporated new sources--most important, the writings of William Herndon, Lincoln's long-time law partner--to update and expand his psychological portrait of our 16th president. \\"This is a remarkable book with extraordinary insights about the inner life of Abraham Lincoln. It will be read and studied for years to come, for Charles Strozier brings to every chapter the very qualities that Lincoln himself possessed--empathy, wisdom, balance, and creativity.\\" -- Doris Kearns Goodwin, Author of No Ordinary Time \\"When Lincoln's Quest for Union was first published, it was immediately recognized as the best-informed and most perceptive analysis of Lincoln's inner life. This new edition, extensively revised and expanded, is even more rewarding. This is a basic book in the Lincoln canon--a work of great intelligence, written with sensitivity and literary grace.

Edible Ideologies argues that representations of food?in literature and popular fiction, cookbooks and travel guides, war propaganda, women?s magazines, television and print advertisements?are not just about nourishment or pleasure. Contributors explore how these various modes of representation, reflecting prevailing attitudes and assumptions about food and food practices, function instead to circulate and transgress dominant cultural ideologies. Addressing questions concerning whose interests are served by a particular food practice or habit and what political ends are fulfilled by the historical changes that lead from one practice to another in Western culture, the essays offer a rich historical narrative that moves from the construction of the nineteenth-century English gentleman to the creation of two of today?s iconic figures in food culture, Julia Child and Martha Stewart. Along the way, readers will encounter World War I propaganda, holocaust and Sephardic cookbooks, the Rosenbergs, German tour guides, fast food advertising, food packaging, and chocolate, and will find food for thought on the meanings of everything from camembert to Velveeta, from salads to burgers, and from tikka masala to Campbell?s soup.

This brief novel tells the story of Sophia, a six-year-old girl awakening to existence, and Sophia s grandmother, nearing the end of hers, as they spend the summer on a tiny unspoiled island in the Gulf of Finland. The grandmother is unsentimental and wise, if a little cranky; Sophia is impetuous and volatile, but she tends to her grandmother with the care of a new parent. Together they amble over coastline and forest in easy companionship, build boats from bark, create a miniature Venice, write a fanciful study of local bugs. They discuss things that matter to young and old alike: life, death, the nature of God and of love.  On an island,  thinks the grandmother,  everything is complete.  In The Summer Book, Jansson creates her own complete world, full of the varied joys and sorrows of life. Tove Jansson, whose Moomintroll comic strip and books brought her international acclaim, lived for much of her life on an island like the one described in The Summer Book, and the work can be enjoyed as her closely observed journal of the sounds, sights, and feel of a summer spent in intimate contact with the natural world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KQO_RlaAgQgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are Those Kids Yours?: American Families With Children Adopted From Other Countries","description":"The question  Are those kids yours?  has a familiar ring to parents who have adopted children from South Korea, India, Colombia, the Philippines, and other countries. As natural and normal as it feels to them to be together, such families are often asked to explain their obvious difference. In rich personal stories drawn from her own experience as the mother of two Korean-born daughters and from interviews with other parents and with adopted children from six to thirty, Cheri Register both affirms the normality of internationally adoptive families and highlights the special challenges they do indeed face. The book addresses many central questions about international adoption: why children are in need of adoption outside the country of their birth, why parents choose to adopt from other countries, and how parents and children of very different origins become a  real  family. International adoption is a controversial matter in countries from which children are coming to the United States, but adoptive families have had little voice as yet in the debate. With honest, thoughtful analysis honed by personal experience, Register addresses the ethical issues inevitably raised by adoption across lines of culture, race, and social class: Are parents in the wealthier nations entitled to raise children left homeless in other parts of the world by poverty or social stigma? Is placement in another country an appropriate solution for children whose parents cannot raise them? Insightful, comprehensive, and eloquent, Are Those Kids Yours? is a unique resource for parents raising internationally adopted children and for those who are contemplating intercountry adoption as well as for the children as they grow up, their extended families and friends, and adoption and mental health professionals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u2yylsaP3SAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cessna Aircraft (Images of Aviation)","description":"A collection of vintage photographs remembering the Cessna Aircraft Company, its military and civilian aircraft, selected aircraft options, original cockpits, and selected press releases from 1940 to the 1960s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zIHXHS5NmwC&dq=Cessna+Aircraft+(Images+of+Aviation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wake of Gods: Melville's Mythology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=897inAAACAAJ&dq=The+Wake+of+Gods:+Melville%27s+Mythology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ANDY WARHOL/SUPERNOVA: Stars, Deaths, and Disasters, 1962-1964","description":"Andy Warhol/Supernova~ISBN 0-935640-83-5 U.S. $39.95 / Hardcover, 9.75 x 13 in. / 112 pgs / 72 color. ~Item / Available / Art","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=az5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=ANDY+WARHOL/SUPERNOVA:+Stars,+Deaths,+and+Disasters,+1962-1964&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brand-New Pencils, Brand-New Books (Book and Audio CD) (Paperback)","description":"Gilbert's excitement over starting first grade turns to worry that the teacher will be mean, the work too hard, and his classmates too unfriendly, but throughout the day there are pleasant surprises.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AdNIh0re8-AC&dq=Brand-New+Pencils,+Brand-New+Books+(Book+and+Audio+CD)+(Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragons: A Natural History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Robot Warriors","description":"It s competition time at Hyperspace High as the students build robots to compete in the annual Robot Warriors contest.

The islanders must work together to uncover the truth  do they need this mans help, or does he really mean them harm? A fascinating adventure story from the much-loved children s author R.M. Ballantyne. R.M. Ballantyne (1825-1894) was a Scottish artist and prolific author of mostly children s fiction. Born in Edinburgh, Ballantyne was the ninth of ten children. At the age of 16 Ballantyne moved to Canada, where he worked for the Hudson s Bay Company, travelling all over the country to trade for fur. He returned to Scotland in 1847 following the death of his father, and it was then that he began his literary career in earnest, writing over 100 children s adventure books over the course of his life. Stories such as  The Coral Island  and  The Young Fur Traders  were hugely popular, and many of them drew on his own experiences of travelling throughout Canada. A stickler for detail, Ballantyne continued to travel widely to research the backgrounds and settings for his exciting stories. His tales became an inspiration for authors of the future, including  Treasure Island  novelist Robert Louis Stevenson. Ballantyne spent the latter period of his life living in London and Italy for the sake of his health.

It is true that in those days of strenuous preparation there was little time for dreaming, yet there were brief moments before sleep claimed me at night and these were my dreams. Such dreams! Always of Mars, and during my waking hours at night my eyes always sought out the Red Planet when he was above the horizon and clung there seeking a solution of the seemingly unfathomable riddle he has presented to the Earthman for ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGLrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic of Handweaving: The Basics and Beyond","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"City of Ghosts: A Novel","description":"From #1 NYT bestselling author Victoria Schwab comes a sweeping, spooky, evocative adventure, perfect for fans of \\"Stranger Things\\" and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.

Whichnoted Malcolm Jones in Newsweek made me laugh so hard I fell off the sofa.  Plain Heathen Mischief ups the existential ante, as Joel King, a defrocked Baptist minister, finds life even more bedeviling once he s served six months for a career-ending crime he might not even have committed. Now his incommunicado wife wants a divorce, the teenage vixen of his disgrace is suing him for a cool $5 million, a fresh start in Montana offers no hope for ex-cons of any religious persuasion, and the refuge provided by his sister turns as nasty as his parole officer. Talk about a crisis of faith. On the upside, a solicitous member of Joel s former congregation invites him into a scam that could yield some desperately needed cash, and soon the down-on-his-luck preacher is involved with a flock of charming con men, crooked lawyers, and conniving youth. In a feat of bravura storytelling, Martin Clark ranges from the cross to the double cross, from Virginia to Las Vegas, from jail cells to trout streams, as he follows his Job-like hero through dubious choices and high-dollar insurance hustles to a redemption that no reader could possibly predict. Wildly imaginative, at times comic, at times profoundly sobering, and even more audacious than his wonderfully idiosyncratic debut, Plain Heathen Mischief is a spiritual revelation of the first order.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i2Dzb0vv_8UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Me, Myself, and I, Inc.: 10 Steps to Career Independence","description":"Outlines ten steps to career independence such as understanding today's changing work environment, creating a vision, and integrating work and life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2tZCd1XEdNsC&dq=Me,+Myself,+and+I,+Inc.:+10+Steps+to+Career+Independence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clifford, el gran perro colorado","description":"A durable board book edition in Spanish of the original classic celebrates Clifford's thirty-fifth anniversary and, in the voice of young Emily Elizabeth, celebrates the Big Red Dog's foibles and misadventures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0qosHAAACAAJ&dq=Clifford,+el+gran+perro+colorado&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Sex for Life Hb","description":"This book provides a comprehensive overview of the range of issues and concerns related to sexuality and health care.

Known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary), this site is home to two mosques, one of which is the third most holy shrine in all of Islam. Jewish fundamentalists want to destroy the mosques on Temple Mount and rebuild the Temple. Christian apocalypticists are financing and supporting their efforts. If the mosques are destroyed, Islamic fundamentalists have vowed to destroy Israel, resulting in the possibility of nuclear war. This book addresses the idea that the recent rise of militant Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalisms and their interaction are endangering peace in the Middle East. It fully examines the thesis that apocalypticist fundamentalists Christians in America, Jews in Israel and America are working together to hasten the coming of the Messiah by instigating a Holy War in the Middle East. Several chapters focus on three U.S. political figures Jerry Falwell, Ronald Reagan, and Pat Robertson who helped bring Christian fundamentalism into the mainstream of American politics. One chapter tells of Jewish preparations for rebuilding the Temple on Temple Mount. Other chapters document the rise of religious fundamentalism in Israel since 1967, Haram al-SharifTemple Mount crises involving Christian-Jewish cooperation, and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism.

Until 1971, life was good for mild-mannered accountant John List. He was vice president of a Jersey City bank and had moved his mother, wife, and three teenage children into a nineteen-room home in Westfield, New Jersey. But all that changed when he lost his job. Raised by his Lutheran father to believe success meant being a good provider, List saw himself as an utter failure. Straining under financial burdens, the stress of hiding his unemployment, as well as the fear that the free-spirited 1970s would corrupt the souls of his children, List came to a shattering conclusion.  It was my belief that if you kill yourself, you won t go to heaven,  List told Connie Chung in a television interview.  So eventually I got to the point where I felt that I could kill them. Hopefully they would go to heaven, and then maybe I would have a chance to later confess my sins to God and get forgiveness.  List methodically shot his entire family in their home, managing to conceal the deaths for weeks with a carefully orchestrated plan of deception. Then he vanished and started over as Robert P. Clark. Chronicling List s life before and after the grisly crime, Death Sentence exposes the truth about the accountant-turned-killer, including his revealing letter to his pastor, his years as a fugitive with a new name and a new wife his eventual arrest, and the details of his high-profile trial.

Based on their extensive teaching experience, the authors present topics in a progressive manner so that each chapter builds on the ones preceding. Researchers and students alike will also appreciate the exploration of more advanced applications and research perspectives presented near the end of the book. Beginning with a brief introduction to the relationship between spectral theory and quantum physics, the authors go on to explore unbounded operators, analyzing closed, adjoint, and self-adjoint operators. Next, the spectrum of a closed operator is defined and the fundamental properties of Fredholm operators are introduced. The authors then develop the Grushin method to execute the spectral analysis of compact operators. The chapters that follow are devoted to examining Hille-Yoshida and Stone theorems, the spectral analysis of self-adjoint operators, and trace-class and Hilbert-Schmidt operators. The final chapter opens the discussion to several selected applications. Throughout this textbook, detailed proofs are given, and the statements are illustrated by a number of well-chosen examples. At the end, an appendix about foundational functional analysis theorems is provided to help the uninitiated reader. A Guide to Spectral Theory: Applications and Exercises is intended for graduate students taking an introductory course in spectral theory or operator theory. A background in linear functional analysis and partial differential equations is assumed; basic knowledge of bounded linear operators is useful but not required. PhD students and researchers will also find this volume to be of interest, particularly the research directions provided in later chapters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KuEsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching Secondary Students Through Their Individual Learning Styles: Practical Approaches for Grades 7-12","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TpucAAAAMAAJ&dq=Teaching+Secondary+Students+Through+Their+Individual+Learning+Styles:+Practical+Approaches+for+Grades+7-12&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War secrets in the ether","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ojgAAAAMAAJ&dq=War+secrets+in+the+ether&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes of a native son (Bantam modern classic)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Safe Conduct an Autobiography and Other Writings","description":"Safe Conduct is Boris Pasternak's first autobiography written when he was forty and after the great success of Dr. Zhivago.

Yet at seventy-five years of age Kung is also something of a senior statesman, one of the -Group of Eminent Persons convened by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and a friend of heads of government like Britain's Tony Blair and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. In this fascinating autobiography Kung gives a frank and outspoken account of the first four decades of his life. He tells of his youth in Switzerland and his decision to become a priest, of his doubts and struggles as he studied in Rome and Paris, and of his experiences as a professor in Tubingen, where he received a chair at the early age of thirty-one. Most importantly, as one of the last surviving eyewitnesses of Vatican II, Kung gives an authentic account of the conflicts behind the scenes. Here it becomes clear just how major an influence he was, to the point of shaping the Council's agenda and drafting speeches for bishops to deliver in plenary sessions. Kung's book offers an acute analysis, compelling in its drama, of meetings with presidents like John F. Kennedy, popes like John XXIII and Paul VI, great theologians like Karl Barth and Karl Rahner, and journeys around the world. With its rich thought and vivid narrative, it paints a moving picture of Kung's personal convictions, including his relentless struggle for a Christianity characterized not by the domination of an official church but by Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6Hm-VmD6_sC&dq=My+Struggle+for+Freedom:+Memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legend of Lexandros (Harlequin Presents..., 23)","description":"Dallas was forced to accept his charity!

Returning always to this personal experience of poetry, Owen Barfield at the same time seeks objective standards of criticism and a theory of poetic diction in broader philosophical considerations on the relation of world and thought.

This classic work by Julian Huxley, first published in 1942, captured and synthesized all that was then known about evolutionary biology and gave a name to the Modern Synthesis, the conceptual structure underlying the field for most of the twentieth century. Many considered Huxley's book a popularization of the ideas then emerging in evolutionary biology, but in fact Evolution: The Modern Synthesis is a work of serious scholarship that is also accessible to the general educated public. It is a book in the intellectual tradition of Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley Julian Huxley's grandfather, known for his energetic championing of Darwin's ideas. A contemporary reviewer called Evolution: The Modern Synthesis  the outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps the century.  This definitive edition brings one of the most important and successful scientific books of the twentieth century back into print. It includes the entire text of the 1942 edition, Huxley's introduction to the 1963 second edition (which demonstrates his continuing command of the field), and the introduction to the 1974 third edition, written by nine experts (many of them Huxley's associates) from different areas of evolutionary biology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FxtFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Evolution,+the+modern+synthesis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bobwhite quail management: A habitat approach (Misc. pub. / Tall Timbers Research Station)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wDc6VtJQkYMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Legally Change Your Name Without a Lawyer","description":"Offers background information on name change situations and takes the reader through the steps of legally changing a name","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tJdjuRWxsqoC&dq=How+to+Legally+Change+Your+Name+Without+a+Lawyer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarantino A to Zed: The Films of Quentin Tarantino","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sinking Of The Eastland: America's Forgotten Tragedy","description":"Chronicles the events of July 24, 1915, when the steamship Eastland capsized and sank in the port of Chicago, killing over eight hundred people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_9iIBlhwC&dq=The+Sinking+Of+The+Eastland:+America%27s+Forgotten+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself VISUALLY Digital Photography, Second Edition","description":"Experience all your Android device has to offer!

A rate equation has been derived which includes the effects of mass-transfer parameters as well chemical parameters and is applicable to any situation for which a mass-transfer coefficient can be obtained. The derived equation has been applied to previously reported rate data taken under laboratory conditions using air and oxygen-helium mix-reported rate data taken under laboratory conditions using air and oxygen-helium mixtures flowing at low subsonic velocities, and a set of values for the activation energy of the oxidation of molybdenum has been obtained. The average of these values is 8.51 x 107 J-(kg-mole)?1 (20.3 kcal-(g-mole)?1) with a standard deviation of 2.1 percent. In addition, 32 molybdenum hemisphere-cylinder specimens have been oxidized in a Mach 2.1 heated airstream at a free-stream stagnation pressure of 1.07 x 106 N-m-?2 (10.5 atm) and free-stream stagnation temperatures from 1765 K to 2120 K. The stagnation-point surface temperature and recession rate were determined for each of the specimens. The observed recession rates were compared with the corresponding values predicted theoretically by the derived rate equation and agreement within a factor of about 2 was obtained for most specimens. However, a few specimens ignited, exhibiting recession rates much greater than those predicted theoretically. The high recession rates associated with ignition were found to be the result of a sharp rise in surface temperature which caused some melting of the specimens in addition to their normal oxidation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rewQAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rock Orchard, The","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Well Performance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4RS3QgAACAAJ&dq=Well+Performance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Precision Framing","description":"Developed as a guide for the authors' crews, this book has evolved into a comprehensive framing handbook -- from basics to finishing techniques.

One section of poems deals with contemporary life, personal history, and the meeting of old and new ways. Another section deals with winter and human responses to light and air. The final group of poems focuses on the nature of women, the ocean, and the way the past relationship of the O'odham with the ocean may still inform present day experience.

She was married with children and a good career. So why did she feel miserable? And why did it seem that other Generation X women were miserable, too? Calhoun decided to find some answers. She looked into housing costs, HR trends, credit card debt averages, and divorce data. At every turn, she saw a pattern: sandwiched between the Boomers and the Millennials, Gen X women were facing new problems as they entered middle age, problems that were being largely overlooked. Speaking with women across America about their experiences as the generation raised to  have it all,  Calhoun found that most were exhausted, terrified about money, under-employed, and overwhelmed. Instead of their issues being heard, they were told instead to lean in, take  me-time,  or make a chore chart to get their lives and homes in order. In Why We Can t Sleep, Calhoun opens up the cultural and political contexts of Gen X s predicament and offers solutions for how to pull oneself out of the abyss and keep the next generation of women from falling in. The result is reassuring, empowering, and essential reading for all middle-aged women, and anyone who hopes to understand them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jkDADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Theory of Syntax for Systemic Functional Linguistics (Current Issues in Linguistic Theory)","description":"This book describes and evaluates alternative approaches within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) to representing the structure of language at the level of form. It assumes no prior knowledge of SFL, and can therefore be read as an introduction to current issues within the theory. It will interest any linguist who takes a functional approach to understanding language. Part 1 summarizes the major developments in the forty years of SFL s history, including alternative approaches within Halliday s own writings and the emergence of the  Cardiff Grammar  as an alternative to the  Sydney Grammar . It questions the theoretical status of the  multiple structure  representations in Halliday s influential Introduction to Functional Grammar (1994), demonstrating that Halliday s model additionally needs an integrating syntax such as that described in Part 2. Part 2 specifies and discusses the set of  categories  and  relationships  that are needed in a theory of syntax for a modern, computer-implementable systemic functional grammar. The theoretical concepts are exemplified at every point, usually from English but occasionally from other languages. The book is both a critique of Halliday s current theory of syntax and the presentation of an alternative version of SFL that is equally systemic and equally functional.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DeQP4uHtLJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking for Two When Minutes Matter","description":"Thirty-six delicious, time-saving menus featuring a vast array of international culinary delights provide shopping lists, complete recipes, and preparation tips for delicious meals in minutes--from appetizer to dessert.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hk8-uCNv6CQC&dq=Cooking+for+Two+When+Minutes+Matter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Culture of Death : The Assault on Medical Ethics in America","description":"This is an updated and revised edition after fifteen years of one of the classic critiques of the modern bioethics movement.

It details the positive contributions made by the profession's many managers and scientists. This work thoroughly describes how this profession has helped make Florida habitable and also puts the environmental controversies of mosquito control in the proper perspective.\\"--Douglas Carlson, Indian River Mosquito Control District \\"The Mosquito Wars is an entertaining, accurate description of how mosquito control has developed in Florida to its current state.\\"--Dennis Moore, editor-in-chief, Wing Beats The Mosquito Wars presents a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the development of human efforts to wage war on mosquitoes in 20th-century Florida. Drawing on archival records, interviews, and published records, Gordon Patterson provides readers with a context for understanding how mosquito control has shaped the environment of contemporary Florida. Patterson reveals how the discovery that yellow fever, malaria, and dengue fever were mosquito-borne diseases had a profound impact on Florida's development in the first half of the 20th century. State agencies organized campaigns from Pensacola to Key West against the disease-bearing insects. World War II opened a new era in mosquito control; the United States Department of Agriculture pioneered the use of DDT as an insecticide, and by 1944 army and navy pilots were regularly flying anti-mosquito missions. The 1950s ushered in a new objective--to reduce not only disease-bearing mosquitoes but also pest and nuisance mosquitoes. The growing problem of chemical resistance, however, led to the use of new and more powerful pesticides, raising concerns about the environmental impact of these chemicals on biologically sensitive wetlands. The ensuing controversy resulted in the rewriting of mosquito control laws in 1986. The continuing occurrences of encephalitis and the recent arrival of the West Nile virus, both transmitted by mosquitoes, dictate that mosquito control will continue to play a vital role in protecting the public's health and welfare. The Mosquito Wars presents a balanced, entertaining, and informative examination of this often heroic and sometimes tragic history of the battle to control mosquitoes in Florida. Gordon Patterson is professor of history at the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LRZ2QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Mosquito+Wars:+A+History+of+Mosquito+Control+in+Florida+(Florida+History+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BCN Speed & Friction: Catalunya Circuit City (Spanish Edition)","description":"One of Europe's great experimental architects directs a university design studio focused on Barcelona.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NndPAAAAMAAJ&dq=BCN+Speed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imperial Moon (Doctor Who Series)","description":"A fifth Doctor and Turlough novel in which the TARDIS materializes on the far side of the moon.

How do these individuals make the split-second decisions that save lives? Most studies of decision making, based on artificial tasks assigned in laboratory settings, view people as biased and unskilled. Gary Klein is one of the developers of the naturalistic decision making approach, which views people as inherently skilled and experienced. It documents human strengths and capabilities that so far have been downplayed or ignored. Since 1985, Klein has conducted fieldwork to find out how people tackle challenges in difficult, nonroutine situations. Sources of Power is based on observations of humans acting under such real-life constraints as time pressure, high stakes, personal responsibility, and shifting conditions. The professionals studied include firefighters, critical care nurses, pilots, nuclear power plant operators, battle planners, and chess masters. Each chapter builds on key incidents and examples to make the description of the methodology and phenomena more vivid. In addition to providing information that can be used by professionals in management, psychology, engineering, and other fields, the book presents an overview of the research approach of naturalistic decision making and expands our knowledge of the strengths people bring to difficult tasks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KZ7uDwAAQBAJ&dq=Sources+of+Power:+How+People+Make+Decisions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Chicago with Kids (Frommer's With Kids)","description":"Let Frommer's show you where your kids can: Crawl inside a coal mine Anchor their very own newscast Root, root, root for the home team Cruise the waterways on a private boat Spend an exhilarating night at the theatre Roll out a sleeping bag with the dinosaurs Ride through city canyons on an elevated train Discover Chicago's parks and all they have to offer Devour a Chicago red hot or a slice of deep-dish pizza Have a good time without breaking the bank Plus invaluable travel tips on: Age ranges for each sight and activity Hotels that offer cribs and rollaway beds Restaurants with kids' menus, boosters, and high chairs Shopping for everything from baby booties to blues music A Chicago parent's words of wisdom on safety in the city","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wa4CjeQeHh8C&dq=Frommer%27s+Chicago+with+Kids+(Frommer%27s+With+Kids)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism","description":"Presenting lore that can spiritually enrich anyone's life, Jewish or not, this one-of-a-kind encyclopedia is devoted to the esoteric in Judaism--the fabulous, the miraculous, and the mysterious.

Janet's first, self-titled, album was released in 1982 when she was 16 years old, but her input to it was minimal. Not until her first marriage, to James DeBarge, was annulled in November 1985 did Janet sit down, to think seriously about her future direction - and, to her surprise, she realised more than anything she wanted to make music. Decision made, Janet bravely took the first big step on the road to taking control of her own destiny. She fired her manager: her father.

Its approximately eighty square miles of mountains and lakes have delighted visitors for more than a century. In the mid-1800s, renowned Hudson River School painter Jasper F. Cropsey, who married local resident Maria Cooley, captured many West Milford landscapes in their autumnal splendor. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, many resorts opened in the township and railroads brought wealthy vacationers from New York City to enjoy the countryside. West Milford also has a rich industrial history; ironworks produced cannonballs, stoves, and other items for the Continental militia during the Revolutionary War, including links for iron chains strung across the Hudson River to block access by the British fleet. In West Milford, previously unpublished images of these places and events bring the past to light, providing insight into the township's rich and diverse history. Featured items include images of the 40-room stone mansion Cross Castle, the flight of the airmail rocket Gloria, Idylease Inn during its construction, and the historic town center.

In Pardon and Peace, originally published back in 1946, Father Wilson captivated audiences with insights like these:  Find yourself confessing the same sins over and over? Here s the reason and helpful advice.  Types of inaccurate confession.  If your examination of conscience tends to be a lengthy ordeal then here s what you re doing wrong.  Two chief considerations for weighing the gravity of a sin.  Three conditions that must be present for a sin to be mortal.  Four guidelines for confessing venial sins.  Common excuses for avoiding Confession.  How to confess a sin of impurity.   Nothing to tell ? You might not be searching properly.

Circumstances beyond their control, mainly difficulties in choosing authors, led to the abandonment of this plan by the time the second volume appeared.

In the present third volume the reader will find: 1. An essay on the development of Chebyshev's theory of approximation of functions, later called \\"constructive function theory\\" by S. N. Bernshtein. This highly original essay is due to the late N. I. Akhiezer (1901-1980), the author of fundamental discoveries in this area.

In 1992 He appeared to Glenda Green and spoke with her daily for almost four months. The expressed purpose of their visit was to paint His portrait, but nothing in the history of her career as an artist or university professor had prepared her for the life transformation that was about to take place. During this time, they spoke ...as friends do, of many wonderful things -both miraculous and practical. Nothing would ever be the same. Her penetrating report of this experience is sincere, unbiased, and free of religious contrivance. In many ways her perceptions provide a bridge to the new millennium. Never before has language or a state of consciousness been present to examine the nature of such a miraculous occurrence as well as to develop the profound implications of it.

It enters a field heretofore unexplored by writers of this great war, whose attention has been mainly directed to the movements of large armies, and the strategy by which their operations were directed. The writer of this modest little book has endeavored to give only the experience of a private soldier, as he stood in the ranks with his comrades, and for three long years bore the fortunes of the Confederacy on the muzzles of their guns. It is hoped a generous public will appreciate the motives that have prompted its author to send it out into the world as an applicant for patronage and support.

In the winter of 1933, Ernest Hemingway and his wife Pauline set out on a two-month safari in the big-game country of East Africa, camping out on the great Serengeti Plain at the foot of magnificent Mount Kilimanjaro.

Now, in Egyptian Mythology, Geraldine Pinch offers a comprehensive introduction that untangles the mystery of Egyptian Myth. Spanning Ancient Egyptian culture--from 3200 BC to AD 400--Pinch opens a door to this hidden world and casts light on its often misunderstood belief system. She discusses the nature of myths and the history of Egypt, from the predynastic to the postpharaonic period. She explains how Egyptian culture developed around the flooding of the Nile, or the \\"inundation,\\" a phenomenon on which the whole welfare of the country depended, and how aspects of the inundation were personified as deities. She explains that the usually cloudless skies made for a preoccupation with the stars and planets. Indeed, much early Egyptian mythology may have developed to explain the movement of these celestial bodies. She provides a timeline covering the seven stages in the mythical history of Egypt and outlining the major events of each stage, such as the reign of the sun God. A substantial A to Z section covers the principal themes and concepts of Egyptian mythology as well as the most important deities, demons, and other characters. For anyone who wants to know about Anubis, the terrifying canine god who presided over the mummification of bodies and guarded burials, or Hathor, the golden goddess who helped women to give birth and the dead to be reborn, or an explanation of the nun, the primeval ocean from which all life came, Egyptian Mythology is the place to look.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hgGNb6wM2kC&dq=Gods+of+Ancient+Egypt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Master the SAT, 2004/e w/CD-ROM (Master the Sat (Book & CD Rom), 2004)","description":"SAT MATH TEST BOOK","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dTSSjwEACAAJ&dq=Master+the+SAT,+2004/e+w/CD-ROM+(Master+the+Sat+(Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Word of Saint John","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Photographing Plants and Flowers","description":"Destined to become the plant photographers bible, this book encourages the reader to 'see' the art and design of the plant and to take photographs that are both accurate visual records and works of creativity.

Elizabeth, Mary, and Sophia Peabody were in many ways the American Bront?s. The story of these remarkable sisters and their central role in shaping the thinking of their day has never before been fully told. Twenty years in the making, Megan Marshall s monumental biography brings the era of creative ferment known as American Romanticism to new life. Elizabeth Peabody, the oldest sister, was a mind-on-fire influence on the great writers of the era Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau among them who also published some of their earliest works; it was she who prodded these newly minted Transcendentalists away from Emerson s individualism and toward a greater connection to others. Middle sister Mary Peabody was a passionate reformer who finally found her soul mate in the great educator Horace Mann. And the frail Sophia, an admired painter among the preeminent society artists of the day, married Nathaniel Hawthorne but not before Hawthorne threw the delicate dynamics among the sisters into disarray.

This is the first cookbook written by an American author specifically published for American kitchens. Named by the Library of Congress as one of the 88 \\"Books That Shaped America,\\" American Cookery was the first cookbook by an American author published in the United States. Until its publication, cookbooks printed and used by American colonists were British. As indicated in Amelia Simmons s subtitle, the recipes in her book were  adapted to this country,  reflecting the fact that American cooks had learned to make do with what was available in North America. This cookbook reveals the rich variety of food colonial Americans used, their tastes, cooking and eating habits, and even their rich, down-to-earth language. Bringing together English cooking methods with truly American products, American Cookery contains the first known printed recipes substituting American maize for English oats; and the recipe for Johnny Cake is apparently the first printed version using cornmeal. The book also contains the first known recipe for turkey. Possibly the most far-reaching innovation was Simmons s use of pearlash a staple in colonial households as a leavening agent in dough, which eventually led to the development of modern baking powders.  Thus, twenty years after the political upheaval of the American Revolution of 1776, a second revolution a culinary revolution occurred with the publication of a cookbook by an American for Americans.  (Jan Longone, curator of American Culinary History, University of Michigan) This facsimile edition of Amelia Simmons's American Cookery was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher, the Society is a research library documenting the life of Americans from the colonial era through 1876. The Society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience. The cookbook collection includes approximately 1,100 volumes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-MPq-VJCkYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collected Mechanoid Invasion Trilogy: The Original Mechanoid Invasion Trilogy Collected for the First Time in This Special Collector's Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XEMbM_-rcowC&dq=The+Collected+Mechanoid+Invasion+Trilogy:+The+Original+Mechanoid+Invasion+Trilogy+Collected+for+the+First+Time+in+This+Special+Collector%27s+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devious Ones","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgufGAAACAAJ&dq=The+Devious+Ones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City Poet: The Life and Times of Frank O'Hara","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Comprehensive Curriculum of Basic Skills Grade 3","description":"Comprehensive Curriculum of Basic Skills for grade 3 covers basic concepts such as reading comprehension, parts of speech, punctuation, spelling, rounding, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, geometry, graphs, time, money, measurement, and place value.

With the challenge of identifying the date, photographer, and circumstances, Kl ver embarked on an inquiry that would illuminate the minute texture of that time and place. Biographical research into the subjects' lives led Kl ver to focus on the summer of 1916 as the likely time the photos were taken. He then measured buildings and plotted angles and lengths of shadows in the photographs to narrow the time frame to a spread of three weeks. Further investigation eventually allowed Kl ver to identify the photographer as Jean Cocteau and to determine the day that Cocteau had taken the photographs: August 12, 1916. A computer printout of the sun's positions on that date, obtained from the Bureau des Longitudes, together with the length of the shadows, enabled Klver to calculate the time of day of each photograph, and thus to put them in proper sequence. In a tour de force of art historical research, Kl ver then reconstructed a scenario of the events of the four hours depicted in the photographs. With evocative attention to detail noting when Picasso is no longer carrying an envelope or Max Jacob has acquired a decoration in his lapel Kl ver recreates a single afternoon in the lives of Picasso and friends, a group of remarkable people in early twentieth-century Paris. Besides the central \\"portfolio\\" of photographs by Cocteau, the book contains additional photographs and drawings, short biographies of all the subjects, and a historical section on the events and activities in the Paris art world at the time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ir1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Day+with+Picasso&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cupid's Darts (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty-two Defendants before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg","description":"Examines each of the defendants in the Nuremberg Trials, during which charges were brought against members of Hitler's Third Reich for wartime atrocities, and considers questions of whether the trials were necessary and just.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kN-mc0QxyhYC&dq=The+Trial+of+the+Germans:+An+Account+of+the+Twenty-two+Defendants+before+the+International+Military+Tribunal+at+Nuremberg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Aboard!","description":"Visit national parks across the United States via train in this wildlife primer boardbook.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W-sIswEACAAJ&dq=All+Aboard!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Encyclical Letters of Pope Leo Xiii, 1878-1903: Or a Light in the Heavens","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Private Life of Kim Philby, The","description":"A stunning debut novel with an intriguing literary hook: written in part as a letter from a victim to her abductor.

Nonetheless, it is still substantially the same as the original Good News Commentary, first published in 1984. These three letters (1 and 2 Timothy and Titus), called the Pastoral Epistles (PE) since the eighteenth century, purport to be letters from the Apostle Paul to two of his younger co-workers, whom he has left in charge of the churches in Ephesus and Crete, respectively. Since the early nineteenth century, however, when doubt was first expressed by F. Schleiermacher, a large array of arguments has been forthcoming that have called their authenticity into question, so that at present the large majority of NT (New Testament) scholars worldwide consider them not authored by Paul but by a pseudepigrapher (although a disciple of Paul), around the turn of the first century A.D. The present commentary has been written from the perspective of Pauline authorship, fully aware of the many difficulties that entails but convinced that theories of pseudepigraphy have even greater historical difficulties. - Introduction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aeFXAAAAYAAJ&dq=1+and+2+Timothy,+Titus+(A+Good+news+commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Korean war: How we met the challenge: How all-out Asian war was averted: Why MacArthur was dismissed: Why today's war objectives must be limited","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Assessing Organizational Communication: Strategic Communication Audits (Guilford Communication Series)","description":"This essential guide offers a detailed framework for assessing communication processes within an organization and using the results to develop improved organizational strategies.

With his characteristically offbeat approach, Conniff focuses on some of the least huggable members of the animal world-- porcupines, snapping turtles, cormorants, bats, mice, moles.

But hidden in obscure scholarly journals and reports, their research is all too often inaccessible to ordinary people. At last, social scientist and psychologist David Niven, Ph.D., distills the scientific gobbledygook of over a thousand of the most compelling and important studies on happiness into easy-to-digest nuggets of advice. Each of the hundred practices, attitudes, and habits for happiness is illustrated with a clear example and illuminated by a straightforward explanation of the science behind it to show you how to transform a ho-hum existence into a full and happy life. Believe In Yourself: Across all ages and all groups, a solid belief in one's own abilities increases life satisfaction by about 40 percent, and makes us happier both in our home lives and in our work lives. Turn Off The TV: Watching too much TV can triple our hunger for more possessions, while reducing our personal contentment by about 5 percent for every hour a day we watch. Enjoy What You Have: People who have the most are only as likely to be happy as those who have the least. People who like what they have, however, are twice as likely to be happy as those who actually have the most. Don't Forget To Have Fun: Having fun is one of the five central factors in leading a satisfied life. Individuals who spend time just having fun are 20 percent more likely to feel happy on a daily basis and 36 percent more likely to feel comfortable with their age and stage in life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R3UuGwAACAAJ&dq=100+Simple+Secrets+of+Happy+People+-+Hallmark+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Negro Songs: 230 Folk Songs and Spirituals, Religious and Secular (Dover Books on Music)","description":"Authoritative study traces the African influences and lyric significance of such songs as Swing Low, Sweet Chariot and John Henry, and gives words and music for 230 songs.

Many concluded that Black Americans' best remaining hope for liberation was the creation of a sovereign nation-state, the Republic of New Afrika (RNA). New Afrikan citizens traced boundaries that encompassed a large portion of the South--including South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana--as part of their demand for reparation. As champions of these goals, they framed their struggle as one that would allow the descendants of enslaved people to choose freely whether they should be citizens of the United States. New Afrikans also argued for financial restitution for the enslavement and subsequent inhumane treatment of Black Americans. The struggle to \\"Free the Land\\" remains active to this day. This book is the first to tell the full history of the RNA and the New Afrikan Independence Movement. Edward Onaci shows how New Afrikans remade their lifestyles and daily activities to create a self-consciously revolutionary culture, and argues that the RNA's tactics and ideology were essential to the evolution of Black political struggles. Onaci expands the story of Black Power politics, shedding new light on the long-term legacies of mid-century Black Nationalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bvXGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fodor's Italy 2004 (Fodor's Gold Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Golden Girl","description":"'I just LOVE [Elin Hilderbrand's] books, they are such compulsive reads' - Marian Keyes When Vivian Howe, author of thirteen novels and mother of three grown-up children, is killed in a hit-and-run incident while jogging near her home, she ascends to the Beyond.

It was this city that served as a catalyst for Burroughs as a writer, the backdrop for one of the most radical transformations of style in literary history. Burroughs's life during this period is limned in a startling collection of short stories, autobiographical sketches, letters, and diary entries, all of which showcase his trademark mordant humor, while delineating the addictions to drugs and sex that are the central metaphors of his work. But it is the extraordinary \\"WORD,\\" a long, sexually wild and deliberately offensive tirade, that blends confession, routine, and fantasy and marks the true turning point of Burroughs as a writer-the breakthrough of his own characteristic voice that will find its full realization in Naked Lunch. James Grauerholz's incisive introduction sets the scene for this series of pieces, guiding the reader through Burroughs's literary evolution from the precise, laconic, and deadpan writer of Junky and Queer to the radical, uncompromising seer of Naked Lunch.

Written forty years ago by a then a young college student, The Making of A Spiritual Movement showed for the first time how the founder of Eckankar had attempted to hide his past and create a new biography replete with mythic characters such as Sudar Singh and Rebazar Tarzs. Paul Twitchell was also a plagiarist of the first rank and copied verbatim whole pages from the work of Julian P. Johnson and others. Many Eckists who read this book in its earlier editions chose to leave the movement and became harsh critics of Eckankar's persistent cover-up of its founder and his questionable activities. The Making of a Spiritual Movement caused such a tremendous uproar within the membership of the group that Eckankar issued a \\"Special Notice to All Eck Chelas,\\" dated December 27, 1979, attempting to squelch the persisting controversy surrounding Lane's ?ndings. The following excerpt reveals in a nutshell Eckankar's of?cial opinion of this book and its ?ndings: \\"It does not tell the straight story. . . was not completely researched and is untrue. These people [David Lane, Mark Albrecht, et al.] are being used by the Kal [Negative] forces to dismantle Eckankar and are referred to by Sri Paul Twitchell in a private tape he made. . . shortly before he translated. Paul said: . . '[These] pagans and heathens are in a conspiracy to destroy Eckankar, not only in the physical but in the psychic worlds. . . those who are bracketed within the category of these people are actually against us. They have been-since the beginning of mankind or the formation of the lower worlds. All these people are under the Kal forces. . Sn' Darwin [Second Living Eck Master] asks that [Lane's research as found in the 1979 SCP Joumal] be destroyed. . . .\\" Obviously, Eckankar does not agree with Lane's ?ndings. However, as Dr. J. Gordon Melton notes, \\"The evidence that David Lane uncovered of Twitchell's creating a false history of his rise to leadership of Eckankar indicates extensive corruption. That the leadership has done nothing to correct Twitchell's false claims, yea, have perpetuated them, indicates a significant problem at the heart of that organization.\\" This particular edition is based primarily on the 1978, 1983, and 1993 versions and thus reflects what was then known about Eckankar and its history. Excerpt from the prefatory section, \\"A number of researchers have discovered that Paul Twitchell's plagiarism was much more extensive and widespread than I even first imagined since it turns out that he had appropriated complete sentences and paragraphs from a variety of books outside of Radhasoami and Sant Mat circles. In light of the Internet and sophisticated scanning applications, it is now possible to track down most of Twitchell's sources word by word. Twitchell wrote at a time when he most likely did suspect that his massive plagiarisms would be discovered, but today it is relatively easy to see where the founder of Eckankar got his inspirations and where he indulged in literary piracy. Moreover, Twitchell's attempt to hide his past has come undone, with new documents and information showing that he never traveled to Europe or Paris at the times he claimed. Despite Twitchell's duplicity there are many who feel that he was a \\"master compiler\\" and a spiritual \\"smash up\\" artist before his time. As for myself, I find Paul Twitchell to be one of the most interesting religious leaders to have emerged from the 1960s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WR6hswEACAAJ&dq=Making+of+a+Spiritual+Movement:+The+Untold+Story+of+Paul+Twitchell+and+Eckankar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One hundred thirty years","description":"'Goodly Heritage' by Dwight L.

A complex individual who yearned to perform Shakespeare on the stage, he achieved success playing low comedy in films and on television. Conried performed in nearly 10,000 radio shows and hundreds of television programs and stage plays, as well as more than 80 films. Over the years, Conried also lent his distinctive voice to numerous animated shorts, phonograph records, commercials, and other projects. Some of his most memorable roles are Dr. Terwilliker in The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T; the voice of Captain Hook from Disney's Peter Pan; eccentric Uncle Tonoose on The Danny Thomas Show; the fussy elocutionist Percy Livermore on I Love Lucy; and the voice of comical villain Snidely Whiplash from Jay Ward's Dudley Do-Right series. This book chronicles Conried's life and career from his birth in 1917 through his death in 1982. Enlivened by many photographs as well as personal reminiscences from family, friends, and colleagues, the book also contains comprehensive information on Conried's radio, television, film, stage and voice work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PNkE0c78qYQC&dq=Hans+Conried:+A+Biography%3B+With+a+Filmography+and+a+Listing+of+Radio,+Television,+Stage+and+Voice+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The King of Terror (Doctor Who)","description":"The Doctor is summoned to a meeting with Brigadier who shows him a photo of a media mogul named Sanger - who's bought enough plutonium to destroy the world ten times over.

In both cases it reads well.... French life in the run-up to World War II was a gangrenous decomposition, to be followed by still worse. The country's leaders found nary a pratfall that they could avoid. They chose a semblance of peace above honor and ended up with neither.... In spite of a masterful prologue, successful synthesis, elegant concision and lucid presentation (or perhaps thanks to them), the reader can't help sharing the nation's shames. A tribute to the historian's talent.\\" -- Eugen Weber, Phi Beta Kappa Key ReporterAt the beginning of 1938, containment of Nazi Germany by a coalition of eastern and western democracies without resorting to war was still a distinct possibility. By the end of 1938, however, Germany was much stronger, the western democracies stood alone, and war was all but certain. The primary cause for these developments, argues Benjamin F. Martin, was the foreign and domestic policies adopted by the French government and embraced by the French people. In a riveting account of the dark days leading up to France's defeat and occupation, Martin reveals a great and civilized nation committing a kind of suicide in 1938. Using movies, novels, newspapers, and sensational court cases, Martin weaves an absorbing tale of France's collective fear and melancholy during this troubled prewar period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6y6SsKyfcGAC&dq=France+in+1938&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TELL ME A RIDDLE","description":"A collection of works, both fictional and non-fictional, gathered together here for the first time --","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-TkpDwAAQBAJ&dq=TELL+ME+A+RIDDLE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quiet Storm (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","description":"The Quiet Storm by RaeAnne Thayne released on Mar 25, 2003 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S7XtXh8b6hMC&dq=The+Quiet+Storm+(Silhouette+Intimate+Moments)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ah-choo (Body Functions)","description":"Some colds are like mice, timid and annoying; others like dragons, accompanied by body aches and deep misery.

A landmark work of unflinching scholarship.  The New York Times This extraordinary account of lynching in America, by acclaimed civil rights historian Philip Dray, shines a clear, bright light on American history s darkest stain illuminating its causes, perpetrators, apologists, and victims. Philip Dray also tells the story of the men and women who led the long and difficult fight to expose and eradicate lynching, including Ida B. Wells, James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and W.E.B. Du Bois. If lynching is emblematic of what is worst about America, their fight may stand for what is best: the commitment to justice and fairness and the conviction that one individual s sense of right can suffice to defy the gravest of wrongs.

Ask Professor Sigmund Swamp or old Brock Gruffy to tell you about their lovely little village and they will talk all day and yet hardly have begun. They will tell you that Fern Hollow nestles at the foot of the trees of Windy Wood and that through the village runs the sparkling ribbon of the River Ferny. The animals of Fern Hollow are all good friends and neighbours, and if you are a stranger they will make you feel at home in next to no time. In this title: Due to a mix-up with parcel labels, Sigmund Swamp accidentally receives a real live crocodile for his birthday. The creature escapes and causes pandemonium around the village. The birds were singing and the early morning sunshine was glinting through the trees as Mr Periwinkle the mailman came driving along the lane in his mail van. Normally, Mr Periwinkle did his rounds on his bicycle but this morning he had an especially large birthday present to deliver to Sigmund Swamp. It was a long wooden crate, and rather strange snorting noises were coming out of it! Carefully, Sigmund began to prise the lid off the crate. As he did this the snorting noises from inside grew louder and louder, until at last the lid popped open and out crawled an enormous crocodile! This is one of the stories from original series two of the 17 titles in the 1980s classic Tales from Fern Hollow series. This gentle story, written and illustrated by John Patience, has eight detailed, colourful and cheerful double-page spreads depicting the animal characters of the village of Fern Hollow, tucked away somewhere in the countryside of Edwardian England. As the inhabitants of Fern Hollow go about their daily lives, there are small adventures to enjoy and little mishaps to overcome. Everyone lends a helping hand and there's always a happy ending - and usually a feast for everyone to share in celebration. The map on the endpapers helps children find their way around the village and appeared in every single title in the Fern Hollow series. Children really love the map and enjoy pointing out where all their favourite Fern Hollow Characters live and all the stories take place. These stories of animal folk have an enduring charm. A generation of people who had the Fern Hollow stories read to them as children have now grown up and are buying the books to read with their own children, nieces and nephews. Parents who read the books with their children back in the 1980s are now enjoying them all over again with their grandchildren. The charming Fern Hollow stories have remained popular since they were first published in 1980.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sCBrzgEACAAJ&dq=Mr+Rustys+New+House:+Tales+Fr+F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dispatch to Death","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87G2tAEACAAJ&dq=Dispatch+to+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lay down your arms: The autobiography of Martha von Tilling","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lN0BAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Invisible Listeners: Lyric Intimacy in Herbert, Whitman, and Ashbery","description":"When a poet addresses a living person--whether friend or enemy, lover or sister--we recognize the expression of intimacy. But what impels poets to leap across time and space to speak to invisible listeners, seeking an ideal intimacy--George Herbert with God, Walt Whitman with a reader in the future, John Ashbery with the Renaissance painter Francesco Parmigianino? In Invisible Listeners, Helen Vendler argues that such poets must invent the language that will enact, on the page, an intimacy they lack in life. Through brilliantly insightful and gracefully written readings of these three great poets over three different centuries, Vendler maps out their relationships with their chosen listeners. For his part, Herbert revises the usual \\"vertical\\" address to God in favor of a \\"horizontal\\" one-addressing God as a friend. Whitman hovers in a sometimes erotic, sometimes quasi-religious language in conceiving the democratic camerado, who will, following Whitman's example, find his true self. And yet the camerado will be replaced, in Whitman's verse, by the ultimate invisible listener, Death. Ashbery, seeking a fellow artist who believes that art always distorts what it represents, finds he must travel to the remote past. In tones both tender and skeptical he addresses Parmigianino, whose extraordinary self-portrait in a convex mirror furnishes the poet with both a theory and a precedent for his own inventions. By creating the forms and speech of ideal intimacy, these poets set forth the possibility of a more complete and satisfactory human interchange--an ethics of relation that is uncoerced, understanding, and free.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wXzFtJfdAJgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Navajo language: A grammar and colloquial dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aggbAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Navajo+language:+A+grammar+and+colloquial+dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weather Patterns & Phenomena (Tab Practical Flying Series)","description":"Explains how weather is not completely random; outlines daily, yearly, seasonal, and locational patterns; and provides simple labels for patterns based on the amount of temperature and moisture, such as \\"hot and dry.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OjJq0Jmrgd8C&dq=Weather+Patterns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Studies in the Dead Sea Scrolls & Related Literature)","description":"Magness (early Judaism, U. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), who has extensive archaeological experience in the area, has written a popular account of the archaeology, meaning, and controversies surrounding the Dead Seas Scrolls and the archaeological site of Qumran where they were found.

His powerful and witty attacks on the vices, abuses, and follies of the big city have been admired and used by many English writers, including Ben Jonson, Dryden, and most notably, Dr Johnson, who described his writing as \`a mixture of gaiety and statelines, of pointed sentences and declamatory grandeur'. Juvenal has been seen as a stern moralist and, more recently, as an extravagant wit, and is acclaimed for his vivid description of the scenes which aroused his anger. He coined the famous phrase designating people \`eager and anxious for two things; bread and races' (panem et circenses'). Niall Rudd's translation reproduces the original style and metrical effect of Juvenal's hexameters. William Barr's Introduction and Notes provide literary and historical background to the sixteen satires.

Computers have completely changed the way we teach children. We have Mindstorms to thank for that. In this book, pioneering computer scientist Seymour Papert uses the invention of LOGO, the first child-friendly programming language, to make the case for the value of teaching children with computers. Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like de-bugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers. Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain.

Burroughs, Vol. 1: 1945-1959","description":"\\"These funny, filthy, and terrifically smart letters reveal him in a way that no biographer can.\\" -- New York Newsday Guru of the Beat generation,  minence grise of the international avant-garde, dark prophet, and blackest of satirists, William S. Burroughs has had a range of influence rivaled by few living writers. This volume of his correspondence from 1945 to 1959 vividly documents the personal and cultural history through which Burroughs developed, revealing clues to illuminate his life and keys to open up his texts. More than that, it shows how letter-writing was itself integral to his life and to his fiction. Beginning as surprisingly formal notes from the road to his friends Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, the letters deepen in substance and style. Then, in Tangier, comes a dramatic shift in voice and vision and the explosive, distinctive letters that will become Naked Lunch. Letters were lifelines for Burroughs, the outcast; and works-in-progress for Burroughs, the writer; and, they track his turbulent journey across two decades and three continents. To read them as they were written is to experience a unique merging of life and letters, the extraordinary story of Williams S.

In this third and most extraordinary volume of the Gonzo Papers, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson recalls high and hideous moments in his thirty years in the Passing Lane -- and no one is safe from his hilarious, remarkably astute social commentary. With Thompson's trademark insight and passion about the state of American politics and culture, Songs of the Doomed charts the long, strange trip from Kennedy to Quayle in Thompson's freewheeling, inimitable style. Spanning four decades -- 1950 to 1990 -- Thompson is at the top of his form while fleeing New York for Puerto Rico, riding with the Hell's Angels, investigating Las Vegas sleaze, grappling with the \\"Dukakis problem,\\" and finally, detailing his infamous lifestyle bust, trial documents, and Fourth Amendment battle with the Law. These tales -- often sleazy, brutal, and crude -- are only the tip of what Jack Nicholson called \\"the most baffling human iceberg of our time.\\" Songs of the Doomed is vintage Thompson -- a brilliant, brazen, bawdy compilation of the greatest sound bites of Gonzo journalism from the past thirty years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5NSsWMglJbsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boston Tea Party (In American History)","description":"Discover the remarkable history of the Boston Tea Party... On a December night in 1773, in an iconic act of civil disobedience, American colonists dressed as Native Americans boarded a merchant ship laden with tea. They tossed the tea into the Boston Harbor in protest of taxation without representation. Their motivation at the time was not one of a battle for independence; rather, they sought what they viewed as their constitutional right to representation in the British Parliament. While not meant to instigate a revolution, this single protest would eventually lead to an all-out conflagration with Great Britain and the American Revolutionary War. This book tells the story of the rising tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain that would result in what became known as the Boston Tea Party. It also tells of how this act of defiance ignited the passions of American patriots and led to the formation of the United States of America. It's an example of how one moment in time can lead to historical changes that affect the entire world. Discover a plethora of topics such as Taxation without Representation The Tea Act of 1773 The Whigs and Their Role in the Protests The British Response Of Patriots and Patriotism: The Major Players The Road to Revolution And much more!

When his body was sold to a London medical college, the suppliers were arrested for murder. Their high-profile trial would unveil London's furtive trade in human corpses carried out by body-snatchers--or \\"resurrection men\\"--who killed to satisfy the first rule of the cadaver market: the fresher the body, the higher the price. Historian Sarah Wise reconstructs not only the boy's murder but the chaos and squalor of London that swallowed the fourteen-year-old vagrant long before his corpse appeared on the slab. In 1831, the city's poor were desperate and the wealthy were petrified, the population swelling so fast that old class borders could not possibly hold. All the while, early humanitarians were pushing legislation to protect the disenfranchised, the courts were establishing norms of punishment and execution, and doctors were pioneering the science of human anatomy. Vivid and intricate, The Italian Boy restores to history the lives of the very poorest Londoners and offers an unparalleled account of the sights, sounds, and smells of a city at the brink of a major transformation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UK_cAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Whitefield's Journals","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The English Gothic: A Bibliographic Guide to Writers from Horace Walpole to Mary Shelley","description":"Product information not available.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nHQWAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+English+Gothic:+A+Bibliographic+Guide+to+Writers+from+Horace+Walpole+to+Mary+Shelley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twelve Sermons on Prayer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KlMCAAAACAAJ&dq=Twelve+Sermons+on+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Innocence: An Autobiography in Letters The Later Years","description":"A second volume of Jane Goodall's autobiography in letters covers the years during which she made many of her most important discoveries on chimpanzee behavior, gave birth to her son, and became an environmental activist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kdr0TP7ou0wC&dq=Beyond+Innocence:+An+Autobiography+in+Letters+The+Later+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Educating for Shalom: Essays on Christian Higher Education","description":"Presents a collection of essays on Christian higher education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CDoZadezFsIC&dq=Educating+for+Shalom:+Essays+on+Christian+Higher+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems and Prayers for Children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QuNbOrTfEoYC&dq=Poems+and+Prayers+for+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wireless Communications and Mobile Commerce","description":"Mobile commerce is based on the rapidly growing applications of wireless technologies and mobile communications.

He has been sent to Cambridge to install a new library at the country home of Lord Montfort. Moments after the foul-tempered Montfort storms away from the afternoon dinner, a gunshot is heard. Hopson runs to the library to find him dead. His nephew and lawyer believe the conclusion is obvious: Montfort, burdened with gambling debts, must have taken his own life. The gun near Montfort's hand suggests suicide, but there are bloody footprints on the library floor. And there is a strange detail: he is clutching a small, elaborately carved box of rare grenadillo wood. No sooner does Nathaniel become the unlikely investigator than another body is found, mutilated and frozen in the pond. Nathaniel knows this victim well -- but what was he doing on Montfort's estate? The search for answers takes Nathaniel from the slums of Fleet Street to the silk-draped rooms of the aristocracy that roil with jealousy and secrets. And he meets Madame Trenti, the alluring and mysterious Drury Lane actress and client of Chippendale's, who seems to have known not only Montfort but the dead man in the pond as well.

The #NoDAPL Standing Rock Protest caught the attention of the world by September 2016. Within a short period of time, all Native Nations, celebrities, pop singers, politicians, high profile activists and others from foreign countries were \\"Standing with Standing Rock\\" What the world came to understand about the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) Protest was a partial story. As the left wing media were the only news stations allowed to share their story, it was controlled from the very start. Far too many people believed the Law Enforcement was attacking the \\"Water Protectors\\" for no reason. They called themselves \\"Peaceful Praying\\" water protectors, as they threw rocks, sticks, urine and more at Law Enforcement officers. They doxed police officers, calling them racist and threatened their spouses to come and rape them, while their husband was out protecting the pipeline company. Many ranchers' livestock went missing and some were killed. What started as a peaceful protest, later turned into a riot. However, throughout the protest, the Sheriff maintained professionalism and upheld the law in an ethical manner. The Tribe Elders and tribal council continuously asked them to remain peaceful and for agitators to leave. Having gained the \\"Worlds\\" support by using their atrocities that occurred centuries ago, they turned around and used the protest to start a politically charged indigenous movement against President Trump and all pipeline companies. They formed their own groups and indirectly funded \\"Eco-Terrorists\\" on the ground in North Dakota.

However, the veterinary profession has changed markedly since those Herriot days, with many more opportunities for people entering the veterinary field, including such as job prospects in bioscience research, government work, specialization in exotic animal medicine, animal welfare advisory work, international development work, and a whole host of other career options. The landscape of the veterinary curriculum has also broadened considerably, with topics like animal behavior, ethics, business management, client communication, veterinary public health, and clinical skills, alongside clinical veterinary medicine. Authored by a Royal Veterinary College instructor with extensive experience within the veterinary profession and with teaching new students, this book provides a thorough explanation of what prospective students can expect to study at veterinary school, and it discusses career options available to new graduates. Additionally, the book offers a useful overview of current issues in the wider veterinary profession, as well as an honest and thought-provoking discussion of what veterinary life is actually like.

The past comes alive in these pages, but so does the present, where you will meet cowboy poets, bull riders, sailplane pilots, desperate chicken farmers, curmudgeonly broncos, a homicidal cow elk, some dubious politicians and several fierce defenders of the earth. Humour and sardonic wit abound, along with abundant affection for the western earth and the people who depend on its bounties and experience its extremes of wind, frost and drought. A western classic, Leaning on the Wind is as evocative today as when it was first published in 1995.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Q9XpyNV68sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elmo's Tub-Time Rhyme (Bath Book)","description":"Rub-a-dub-dub read this book in the tub!

Inspired by such modern writers as Alifa Rifaat, Nawal al-Sadawi, and Youssef Idris - authors who have, despite immeasurable odds, managed to emphasize subjects ranging from feminism to homosexuality in their works - these short stories attempt to further engage various social and political issues that remain, for the most part, largely ignored or silenced in modern Arabic literature. Most of the stories in The Native Informant & Other Stories operate on a dual level by addressing not only issues related to women, homosexuals, and victims of violence in southwest Asia, but also by examining the seemingly conflicting relationship between notions of Arabness, Islam, and the West. The collection thus aims at highlighting the plight of marginalized groups in Arab countries by broaching various issues on the social spectrum, ranging from religious intolerance, to the subjugation of women, to homophobia, to domestic violence, to Western and Eastern concepts of terrorism and neo/post coloniality, to the ethnic experience of being an Arab in the United States at a time when the media seems to be promulgating the negative stereotype of the Arab.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XLJrVyxz5ZQC&dq=Rustic+Sunset+(Three+Continents+Press)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paralegal Aide Passbook (Test Preparation Study Guide, Questions & Answers)","description":"The Paralegal Aide Passbook prepares you for your test by allowing you to take practice exams in the subjects you need to study.

That problem is what to make of the Comedy's claim to the status of revelation, vision, or experiential record - as something more than imaginative literature. In this book Moevs offers the first sustained treatment of the metaphysical picture that grounds and motivates the Comedy, and the relation between those metaphysics and Dante's poetics. Moevs arrives at the radical conclusion that Dante believed that all of what we perceive as reality, the spatio-temporal world, is in fact a creation or projection of conscious being. Armed with this new understanding, Moevs is able to shed light on a series of perennial issues in the interpretation of the Comedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lsQTDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Metaphysics+of+Dante%27s+Comedy+(Reflection+and+Theory+in+the+Study+of+Religion)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matter and Motion in God's Universe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zrLBoAEACAAJ&dq=Matter+and+Motion+in+God%27s+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exchange Rate Policy in Europe (Applied Econometrics Association Series)","description":"A collection of articles presented at the XLVI Applied Econometrics Association conference on exchange rates held in Heigerloch Castle, Germany), in 1995.

We burn 2,000 calories a day. And if we exercise and cut carbs, we'll lose more weight. Right? Wrong. In this paradigm-shifting book, Herman Pontzer reveals for the first time how human metabolism really works so that we can finally manage our weight and improve our health. Pontzer's groundbreaking studies with hunter-gatherer tribes show how exercise doesn't increase our metabolism. Instead, we burn calories within a very narrow range: nearly 3,000 calories per day, no matter our activity level. This was a brilliant evolutionary strategy to survive in times of famine. Now it seems to doom us to obesity. The good news is we can lose weight, but we need to cut calories. Refuting such weight-loss hype as paleo, keto, anti-gluten, anti-grain, and even vegan, Pontzer discusses how all diets succeed or fail: For shedding pounds, a calorie is a calorie. At the same time, we must exercise to keep our body systems and signals functioning optimally, even if it won't make us thinner. Hunter-gatherers like the Hadza move about five hours a day and remain remarkably healthy into old age. But elite athletes can push the body too far, burning calories faster than their bodies can take them in. It may be that the most spectacular athletic feats are the result not just of great training, but of an astonishingly efficient digestive system. Revealing, irreverent, and always entertaining, Pontzer has written a book that will change how you eat, move, and live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4APyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Duesenberg","description":"With only 435 cars still in existence, the Duesenberg??the Rolls Royce of American automobiles,? is demanding a hefty price tag, selling for upwards of $1 million!

The four Melendy children live with their father and Cuffy, their beloved housekeeper, in a worn but comfortable brownstone in New York City. There's thirteen-year-old Mona, who has decided to become an actress; twelve-year-old mischievous Rush; ten-and-a-half-year-old Randy, who loves to dance and paint; and thoughtful Oliver, who is just six. Tired of wasting Saturdays doing nothing but wishing for larger allowances, the four Melendys jump at Randy's idea to start the Independent Saturday Afternoon Adventure Club (I.S.A.A.C.). If they pool their resources and take turns spending the whole amount, they can each have at least one memorable Saturday afternoon of their own. Before long, I.S.A.A.C. is in operation and every Saturday is definitely one to remember. Written more than half a century ago, The Saturdays unfolds with all the ripe details of a specific place and period but remains, just the same, a winning, timeless tale. The Saturdays is the first installment of Enright's Melendy Quartet, an engaging and warm series about the close-knit Melendy family and their surprising adventures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y-CUCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Xenophobe's Guide to the Dutch (Xenophobe's Guides - Oval Books)","description":"A guide to understanding the Dutch that goes beyound the tulips and windmills to reveal their real personality and peculiarities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UKYmBAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Xenophobe%27s+Guide+to+the+Dutch+(Xenophobe%27s+Guides+-+Oval+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talking Pictures: People Speak About the Photographs That Speak to Them","description":"Seventy writers, artists, musicians, politicians, and professionals describe pictures they find fascinating and the reasons for their reactions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i9g4AQAAIAAJ&dq=Talking+Pictures:+People+Speak+About+the+Photographs+That+Speak+to+Them&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burp!: A Story Cookbook (A Cookbook With Pizazz... )","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vast Domain of Blood: The Story of the Camp Grant Massacre (Great West and Indian series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MATH AND LITERATURE (K-3): BOOK ONE (Math & Literature (K-3))","description":"\\"This resource provides classroom-tested ideas and methods for linking math and literature skills in the primary grades.

Each introduced with a brief, pungent or witty commentary. Chess brevities have always exercised a special attraction for lovers of the royal game. It may be well that we welcome the punishment inexorably meted out for some trifling slip. Maybe it's out inherent sadism that makes us enjoy the spectacle of speedy punishment doled out to someone else, just as a fight fan thrills to a one-round knockout. Perhaps it's only our inherent laziness after all, to play over a brevity, one often need not bother to set up the pieces. Be that is it may, its popularity is universal. And here are the best of them, gathered together in one volume, for your pleasure and enjoyment. Many of us know instances galore of beginners becoming a cropper after only a few moves through the \\"scholar's mate\\" or some other absurdity not necessarily so primitive.

This lush new novel tells the story behind one of the great tributes to romantic love and one of the seven wonders of the world -- the Taj Mahal. Mehrunnisa, better known as Empress Nur Jahan, comes into Jahangir's harem as his twentieth and last wife. Almost from the beginning of her royal life she fits none of the established norms of womanhood in seventeenth-century India. Mehrunnisa is the first woman Jahangir marries for love, at the \\"old\\" age of thirty-four. He loves her so deeply that he eventually transfers his powers of sovereignty to her. Power and wealth do not come easily to Mehrunnisa -- she has to fight for them. She has a formidable rival in the imperial harem, Empress Jagat Gosini, who has schemed and plotted against Mehrunnisa from early on. Mehrunnisa's problems do not just lie within the harem walls, but at court, too, as she battles powerful ministers for supremacy. These ministers, who have long had Emperor Jahangir's confidence and trust, consider Mehrunnisa a mere woman who cannot have a voice in the outside world. Mehrunnisa combats all of this by forming a junta of sorts with three men she can rely on -- her father, her brother, and Jahangir's son Prince Khurram. She demonstrates great strength of character and cunning to get what she wants, sometimes at a cost of personal sorrow when she almost loses her daughter's love. But she never loses the love of the man who bestows this power upon her -- Emperor Jahangir. The Feast of Roses is a tale of this power and love, the story of power behind a veil.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LAIN1cOlEVsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Christmas #1 (The Last Christmas, volume 1)","description":"'The perfect gift for anyone who loves all things Christmas ... it's a festive gem' Woman & Home 'A beautiful, funny and soulful collection of personal essays' Prima ___________ The perfect gift book, featuring the writing of Meryl Streep, Bill Bailey, Emilia Clarke, Olivia Colman, Caitlin Moran, Richard Ayoade, Emily Watson and others, to coincide with the upcoming movie Last Christmas, starring Emma Thompson, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding.

Sojourner Truth first gained prominence at an 1851 Akron, Ohio, women's rights conference, saying, \\"Dat man over dar say dat woman needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches. . . . Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles . . . and ar'n't I a woman?\\" Sojourner Truth: ex-slave and fiery abolitionist, figure of imposing physique, riveting preacher and spellbinding singer who dazzled listeners with her wit and originality. Straight-talking and unsentimental, Truth became a national symbol for strong black women--indeed, for all strong women. Like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, she is regarded as a radical of immense and enduring influence; yet, unlike them, what is remembered of her consists more of myth than of personality. Now, in a masterful blend of scholarship and sympathetic understanding, eminent black historian Nell Irvin Painter goes beyond the myths, words, and photographs to uncover the life of a complex woman who was born into slavery and died a legend. Inspired by religion, Truth transformed herself from a domestic servant named Isabella into an itinerant pentecostal preacher; her words of empowerment have inspired black women and poor people the world over to this day. As an abolitionist and a feminist, Truth defied the notion that slaves were male and women were white, expounding a fact that still bears repeating: among blacks there are women; among women, there are blacks. No one who heard her speak ever forgot Sojourner Truth, the power and pathos of her voice, and the intelligence of her message. No one who reads Painter's groundbreaking biography will forget this landmark figure and the story of her courageous life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=83lgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Epistle of James and Eschatology (Journal for the Study of the New Testament Supplement)","description":"The aim of this book is to challenge the common view that the epistle of James is a late Hellenistic Wisdom document that has little importance for our understanding of earliest Christianity.

But nowhere is this drive to do better more important than in medicine, where lives are on the line with every decision. In this book, Atul Gawande explores how doctors strive to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of obstacles that sometimes seem insurmountable. Gawande's gripping stories of diligence, ingenuity, and what it means to do right by people take us to battlefield surgical tents in Iraq, to labor and delivery rooms in Boston, to a polio outbreak in India, and to malpractice courtrooms around the country. He discusses the ethical dilemmas of doctors' participation in lethal injections, examines the influence of money on modern medicine, and recounts the astoundingly contentious history of hand washing. And as in all his writing, Gawande gives us an inside look at his own life as a practicing surgeon, offering a searingly honest firsthand account of work in a field where mistakes are both unavoidable and unthinkable. At once unflinching and compassionate, Better is an exhilarating journey narrated by \\"arguably the best nonfiction doctor-writer around\\" (Salon).

Later it becomes the nucleus of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the detonator for the Big Bang of Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s.

With these reforms, political parties have sought to draw on the political credibility of an independent central bank to cope with electoral consequences of economic internalization and deindustrialization. New Zealand and Italy made the initial efforts to grant their central banks independence. More recently, France, Spain, Britain, and Sweden have reformed their central banks' independence. Additionally, members of the European Union have implemented a single currency, with an independent European central bank to administer monetary policy. Banking on Reform stresses the politics surrounding the choice of these institutions, specifically the motivations of political parties. Where intraparty conflicts have threatened the party's ability to hold office, politicians have adopted an independent central bank. Where political parties have been secluded from the political consequences of economic change, reform has been thwarted or delayed. The drive toward a single currency also reflects these political concerns. By delegating monetary policy to the European level, politicians in the member states removed a potentially divisive issue from the domestic political agenda, allowing parties to rebuild their support constructed on the basis of other issues. William T. Bernhard provides a variety of evidence to support his argument, such as in-depth case accounts of recent central bank reforms in Italy and Britain, the role of the German Bundesbank in the policy process, and the adoption of the single currency in Europe. Additionally, he utilizes quantitative and statistical tests to enhance his argument. This book will appeal to political scientists, economists, and other social scientists interested in the political and institutional consequences of economic globalization. William T. Bernhard is Assistant Professor of Political Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-ANlTlu8LEYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Examine the Nervous System","description":"A classic collection of time-proven physical techniques for the examination of the nervous system, written by one of North America's most respected neurologists.

You might think the key to innovation is attracting exceptional creative talent. Or making the right investments. Or breaking down organizational silos. All of these things may help but there s only one way to ensure sustained innovation: you need to lead it and with a special kind of leadership. Collective Genius shows you how. Preeminent leadership scholar Linda Hill, along with former Pixar tech wizard Greg Brandeau, MIT researcher Emily Truelove, and Being the Boss coauthor Kent Lineback, found among leaders a widely shared, and mistaken, assumption: that a  good  leader in all other respects would also be an effective leader of innovation. The truth is, leading innovation takes a distinctive kind of leadership, one that unleashes and harnesses the  collective genius  of the people in the organization. Using vivid stories of individual leaders at companies like Volkswagen, Google, eBay, and Pfizer, as well as nonprofits and international government agencies, the authors show how successful leaders of innovation don t create a vision and try to make innovation happen themselves. Rather, they create and sustain a culture where innovation is allowed to happen again and again an environment where people are both willing and able to do the hard work that innovative problem solving requires. Collective Genius will not only inspire you; it will give you the concrete, practical guidance you need to build innovation into the fabric of your business.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NVZwAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pythons Autobiography By the Pythons","description":"This is the definitive, the official, the most lavish, the completely-different-to-anything-done-before Pythons' autobiography, reissued to coincide with the eagerly-anticipated live shows.

This book is a non-fiction version of Angels and Demons - only without the angels or the demons. It is a serious and strictly scientific attempt to make sense of all the knowledge acquired by our species during the course of history. In particular, this book seeks to reconcile the exciting discoveries of the first part of the Twentieth Century (including relativity and the Big Bang) with the perplexing discoveries of the second half of that troubled century, when strange and paradoxical solutions were offered by science (most notably quantum physics and Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty). The conclusions of the book can be summarized by saying that it is an admittedly immodest effort to compile a \\"theory of everything.\\" Weaving together the theories of humanity's quest for harmonious understanding of nature, its origins and its destiny entailed many mysteries; solving those mysteries often required advancing novel ideas. Perhaps the most creative of all is the proposition that the Big Bang produced not just space and time, but order as well. This proposition is buttressed by the latest findings in astronomy, which suggest that order came quickly to our world, as if delivered in a package, complete with ribbons and wrapping intended for our appreciation and use. Does that mean that the package was created by anomnipotent being - the god of theology? The answer to that question is not tackled until the last two chapters. The first eight tackle a more elementary question: whether our species differs from the animals merely in the sense of being a more sophisticated aggregation of organic life, as Darwin argued. That view is contrasted to one characterized as Integral Humanism, a philosophical framework which offers the opposing argument, under which humans are understood to be an unpredictable and wonderful mixture of three distinct dimensions: mind, matter and spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UpQ3mAEACAAJ&dq=A+Unified+Theory+of+God,+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EYE OF THE DEVIL","description":"Interstellar antiquities dealer Alex Benedict and his assistant Chase Kolpath travel to the most remote of human worlds and uncover a secret connected to a decades-old political upheaval-a secret that somebody desperately wants hidden.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WPqWsGR4-wMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Ladies Cook Book Favorite Recipes of all the Presidents of the United States","description":"Simple and gourmet presidential dishes are pictured and described, with information on the domestic activities of each family","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FJDHvgEACAAJ&dq=The+First+Ladies+Cook+Book+Favorite+Recipes+of+all+the+Presidents+of+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My friend, I care: The grief experience","description":"\\"My Friend, I Care addresses the normalcy of grieving while offering suggestions for moving forward into living.

A video game is half-real: we play by real rules while imagining a fictional world. We win or lose the game in the real world, but we slay a dragon (for example) only in the world of the game. In this thought-provoking study, Jesper Juul examines the constantly evolving tension between rules and fiction in video games. Discussing games from Pong to The Legend of Zelda, from chess to Grand Theft Auto, he shows how video games are both a departure from and a development of traditional non-electronic games. The book combines perspectives from such fields as literary and film theory, computer science, psychology, economic game theory, and game studies, to outline a theory of what video games are, how they work with the player, how they have developed historically, and why they are fun to play. Locating video games in a history of games that goes back to Ancient Egypt, Juul argues that there is a basic affinity between games and computers. Just as the printing press and the cinema have promoted and enabled new kinds of storytelling, computers work as enablers of games, letting us play old games in new ways and allowing for new kinds of games that would not have been possible before computers. Juul presents a classic game model, which describes the traditional construction of games and points to possible future developments. He examines how rules provide challenges, learning, and enjoyment for players, and how a game cues the player into imagining its fictional world. Juul's lively style and eclectic deployment of sources will make Half-Real of interest to media, literature, and game scholars as well as to game professionals and gamers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pyo3AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of Edgar Allan Poe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of the Reign of Ferdinand And Isabella The Catholic - Vol 1","description":"\\"The History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic\\" in 3 volumes is one of the best-known works by the American historian William Hickling Prescott. Isabella I (1451-1504) was Queen of Castile from 1474 and Queen consort of Aragon from 1479, reigning over a dynastically unified Spain jointly with her husband Ferdinand II (1452-1516). After a struggle to claim her right to the throne, she reorganized the governmental system, brought the crime rate to the lowest it had been in years, and unburdened the kingdom of the enormous debt her brother had left behind. Isabella's marriage to Ferdinand in 1469 created the basis of the de facto unification of Spain. Isabella and Ferdinand are known for completing the Reconquista, ordering conversion or exile to their Jewish and Muslim subjects, and for supporting and financing Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage that led to the opening of the New World and to the establishment of Spain as a major power in Europe and much of the world for more than a century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QtNhEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the Tenth Century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h-toAAAAMAAJ&dq=Khazarian+Hebrew+Documents+of+the+Tenth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paintbox No 1","description":"These playful, pint-size patterns mix vibrant colors with clever motifs that kids will want to put on parade!

The scenario allows the teacher to familiarise and individualise the lesson to suit the needs of their student; however, it can also lead to speculation about what is taught. More troubling is the heightened risk of gossip and rumour with the private space generating speculation about the studentteacher relationship. Venanzio Rauzzini (17461810), an Italian castrato living in England who became a highly sought-after singing master, was particularly susceptible since his students tended to be women, whose moral character was under more scrutiny than their male counterparts. Even so in 1792, The Bath Chronicle proclaimed the Italian castrato: 'the father of a new style in English singing'. Branding Rauzzini as a founder of an English style was not an error, but indicative of deep-seated anxieties about the Italian invasion on England s musical culture. This book places teaching at the centre of the socio-historical narrative and provides unique insight into musical culture. Using a microhistory approach, this study is the first to focus in on the impact of teaching and casts new light on issues of celebrity culture, gender and nationalism in Georgian England.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HuZXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Prep for the SAT Math Subject Tests Level 1 and Level 2 (with 10 Fully Solved Sample Tests)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Peekaboo!

Translations of his own writings traveled even more widely than he did, earning him adulation throughout Europe, Asia, and especially the Americas. In The Worlds of Langston Hughes, Vera Kutzinski contends that, for writers who are part of the African diaspora, translation is more than just a literary practice: it is a fact of life and a way of thinking. Focusing on Hughes s autobiographies, translations of his poetry, his own translations, and the political lyrics that brought him to the attention of the infamous McCarthy Committee, she shows that translating and being translated and often mistranslated are as vital to Hughes s own poetics as they are to understanding the historical network of cultural relations known as literary modernism. As Kutzinski maps the trajectory of Hughes s writings across Europe and the Americas, we see the remarkable extent to which the translations of his poetry were in conversation with the work of other modernist writers. Kutzinski spotlights cities whose role as meeting places for modernists from all over the world has yet to be fully explored: Madrid, Havana, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and of course Harlem. The result is a fresh look at Hughes, not as a solitary author who wrote in a single language, but as an international figure at the heart of a global intellectual and artistic formation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x1OelSfqK8QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kauffmans Manual Riding Safety","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Warehouse Safety: A Practical Guide to Preventing Warehouse Incidents and Injuries","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Roman portraits","description":"Portrait sculptures are among the most vibrant records of ancient Greek and Roman culture. They represent people of all ages and social strata: revered poets and philosophers, emperors and their family members, military heroes, local dignitaries, ordinary citizens, and young children. The Met's distinguished collection of Greek and Roman portraits in stone and bronze is published in its entirety for the first time in this volume. Paul Zanker, a leading authority on Roman sculpture today, has brought his exceptional knowledge to the study of these portraits; in presenting them, he brings the ancient world to life for contemporary audiences. Each work is lavishly illustrated, meticulously described, and placed in its historical and cultural context. The lives and achievement of significant figures are discussed in the framework of the political, social, and practical circumstances that influenced their portrait's forms and styles from the unvarnished realism of the late Republican period to the idealizing and progressively abstract tendencies that followed. Analyses of marble portraits recarved into new likenesses after their original subjects were forgotten or officially repudiated provide especially compelling insights. Observations on fashions in hairstyling, which typically originated with the Imperial family and spread as fast as the rulers' latest portraits could be distributed, not only edify and amuse but also link the Romans' motives and appetite for imitation to our own. More than a collection catalogue, Roman Portraits is a thorough and multifaceted survey of ancient portraiture. Charting the evolution of this art from its origins in ancient Greece, it renews our appreciation of an connection to these imposing, timeless works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OPN2DQAAQBAJ&dq=Roman+portraits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kremlin Wives","description":"For over seventy years the Kremlin was the bastion of the all-powerful Soviet rulers. A great deal is known about the men who held millions of fates in their iron grip, yet little is known about the women the wives and mistresses who shared their lives. They took part in the Revolution and its aftermath, bore children, and suffered abuse; some were arrested and sent to Siberia, driven to suicide, or even murdered. In 1991 the KGB granted the author access to its secret files, which, together with the author s own research and interviews, provided the material for this book. Here for the first time the stark and sometimes scandalous truth about these women is revealed. Lenin s wife worked passionately for the Revolution alongside her husband, from the time of Lenin s exile until her death. His mistress was also a close friend of his wife. Stalin married Nadezhda Alliluyeva when she was only sixteen. Earlier, he had had a relationship with Nadezhda s mother, and there is strong evidence that his wife may also have been his daughter. When she was found dead in a pool of blood, the official verdict was suicide, but many believe she was murdered. Secret Police Chief Lavrenti Beria, known as  The Butcher,  roamed the streets in Moscow in a curtain-drawn limousine, stalking young girls who would later be abducted by his agents. One was forced to marry Beria his wife Nina Teimurazovna. Among the many other Kremlin  wives  portrayed here are: Alexandra Kollontai, feminist and supporter of  free love ; Larissa Reisner, Boris Pasternak s muse; Olga Kameneva, Trotsky s sister; Nina Khrushchev; Victoria Brezhnev; Galina Brezhneva; Tatyana Fillipovna Andropov, and Raisa Gorbachev supposedly the only Soviet ruler s wife to have married for love.

Who loves us? And why? Is love really a mystery, or can neuroscience offer some answers to these age-old questions? In her third enthralling book about the brain, Judith Horstman takes us on a lively tour of our most important sex and love organ and the whole smorgasbord of our many kinds of love-from the bonding of parent and child to the passion of erotic love, the affectionate love of companionship, the role of animals in our lives, and the love of God. Drawing on the latest neuroscience, she explores why and how we are born to love-how we're hardwired to crave the companionship of others, and how very badly things can go without love. Among the findings: parental love makes our brain bigger, sex and orgasm make it healthier, social isolation makes it miserable-and although the craving for romantic love can be described as an addiction, friendship may actually be the most important loving relationship of your life. Based on recent studies and articles culled from the prestigious Scientific American and Scientific American Mind magazines, The Scientific American Book of Love, Sex, and the Brain offers a fascinating look at how the brain controls our loving relationships, most intimate moments, and our deep and basic need for connection.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5QnkhRsHoQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Squawky: The Adventures of a Clasperchoice","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Geochemistry","description":"This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field ofgeochemistry.

The quotations are grouped thematically under 65 different headings, from \\"The Nature of Language\\" through the \\"Language of Politics\\" to \\"Quoting and Misquoting.\\" This arrangement enables the reader to explore a topic through a variety of lenses, ancient and modern, domestic and foreign, scientific and casual, ironic and playful.

How did the South lose its most important city? In this exhaustively researched, authoritative, well-argued study, Chester Hearn examines the decisions, actions, individuals, and events that brought about the capture of New Orleans - and forever weakened the Confederate war machine. Hearn directs his inquiry to the heart of government, both Union and Confederate, and takes a hard look at the selection of military and naval leaders, the use of natural and financial resources, and the performances of all personnel involved. The decisions of Jefferson Davis, Stephen R. Mallory, and three Confederate secretaries of war, he holds, were as much to blame for the fall of New Orleans as David Farragut's warships. Hearn also scrutinizes the role of Major General Mansfield Lovell and evaluates the investigation that ended his career. Hearn's explorations bring us into a flourishing New Orleans and introduce Louisiana leaders Thomas O. Moore and the debilitated old men sent to prepare the state for war: Major General David E. Twiggs and Commodore Lawrence Rousseau. We follow their trifling efforts to defend the lower Mississippi and General Lovell's frustrations in attempting to arm forts and obtain cooperation from the navy, and we come to understand the dismay of such leaders as P.G.T. Beauregard and Braxton Bragg as they witnessed this bungling. Hearn traces the building of the ironclads Manassas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and investigates the reason for their failure to defend New Orleans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M1Z0-hnvy8QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A dictionary of the spanish and English languages","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dXe7Iy09i5MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Night","description":"Young Rosamunde Overton is forced into a daring deceit when her elderly husband cannot sire an heir.

Using as her point of departure the Industrial and French Revolutions, the European upheavals of 1848, the American Civil War, and the Paris Commune of 1871, Dunayevskaya shows how Marx, inspired by these events, adapted Hegel's philosophy to analyze the course of history as a dialectical process that moves \\"from practice to theory.\\" The essence of Marx's philosophy, as Dunayevskaya points out, is the human struggle for freedom, which entails the gradual emergence of a proletarian revolutionary consciousness and the discovery through conflict of the means for realizing complete human freedom. But freedom for Marx meant freedom not only from capitalist economic exploitation but also from all political restraints. Continuing her historical analysis, Dunayevskaya reveals how completely Marx's original conception of freedom was perverted through its adaptations by Stalin in Russia and Mao in China, and the subsequent erection of totalitarian states. The exploitation of the masses persisted under these regimes in the form of a new \\"state capitalism.\\" Yet despite the profound derailment of Marxist political philosophy in the twentieth century, Dunayevskaya points to developments such as the Hungarian revolt of 1956, and the Civil Rights struggles in the United States as signs that the indomitable quest for freedom on the part of the downtrodden cannot be forever repressed. The Hegelian dialectic of events propelled by the spirit of the masses thus moves on inexorably with the hope for the future achievement of political, economic, and social freedom and equality for all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U57aAAAAMAAJ&dq=Marxism+and+freedom:+From+1776+until+today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Like That","description":"The rapper-turned-ordained minister shares the story of his spirituality, including thirteen \\"house rules\\" for promoting love, wealth, and God in one's life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xmIGCAAAQBAJ&dq=It%27s+Like+That&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starch Madness","description":"Publisher Marketing: Starch Madness offers healthy eating guidelines that really work!

The battle of 'Red' Harlaw, fought on 24 July 1411 is one of the most famous fought on Scottish soil, and infamous for the ferocity and duration of the fighting. However, it still remains something of an enigma. Donald Lord of the Isles, spurred on by a dispute over the Earldom of Ross with the Scottish regent, Robert Duke of Albany, led a Highland host to burn Inverness and descend upon Aberdeen. At Inverurie the Highlanders clashed with the smaller Lowlander force of Alexander Earl of Mar, son of the infamous 'Wolf of Badenoch'. The Highland clansmen flung themselves against the Lowland spears, their fearsome long swords and sharp axes doing fearful execution. Wave upon wave of the mighty highland force charged forth, only to meet their death at the hands of the more efficient Lowland force, fighting against the odds. Casualties on both sides were heavy as the carnage continued throughout the day. At dusk, the Lord of the Isles withdrew, leaving the blood-soaked field to Mar's hard-won victory and almost 1,000 of his Highland soldiers dead.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BzXBNwAACAAJ&dq=Clan+Donald%27s+Greatest+Defeat:+The+Battle+of+Harlaw+1411&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Power Rests with You","description":"All the Power Rests with You is a collection of poems written for children who might need the reassurance through the medium of poetry that they are indeed okay and special.

When Indie Brown was four years old, she was struck by lightning. In the oft-told version of the story, Indie s life was heroically saved by her mother. But Indie s own recollection of the event, while hazy, is very different. Most of Indie s childhood memories are like this tinged with vague, unsettling images and suspicions. Her mother, Judy, fussed over her pretty youngest daughter, Lily, as much as she ignored Indie. That neglect, coupled with the death of her beloved older brother, is the reason Indie now lives far away in rural Maine. It s why her relationship with Lily is filled with tension, and why she dreads the thought of flying back to Arizona. But she has no choice. Judy is gravely ill, and Lily, struggling with a challenge of her own, needs her help. In Arizona, faced with Lily s hysteria and their mother s instability, Indie slowly begins to confront the truth about her half-remembered past and the legacy that still haunts her family. And as she revisits her childhood, with its nightmares and lost innocence, she finds she must reevaluate the choices of her adulthood including her most precious relationships.  Lush, evocative.

Billy Graham looms large as one of the twentieth century's most influential and innovative leaders. Most people are unaware of his remarkable effectiveness as not only preacher and pastor, but as a CEO and a global leader as well. The Leadership Secrets of Billy Graham is full of transferable applications for leaders in the church, parachurch, academia, government, and business. Lively interviews with his closest associates illustrate 21 principles that have driven six decades of visionary impact. First-hand accounts reveal stories of courageous leadership and growth through painful lessons. Graham's relentless application of core beliefs and leadership principles have resulted in, among many honors, being listed in Gallup's ten 'most admired men' thirty times, more than anyone else. Time magazine named him one of the top ten leaders of the twentieth century. This book asks: How did this happen? What are the essentials he embraced to achieve such extraordinary results? What can we learn from him and apply to our own leadership roles? This book is dedicated to those readers: who sense the pressing need in today's world for inspired leadership; who rise to leadership's high calling and are willing to carry its weight; who are determined to deepen and expand their capacities and effectiveness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pfrjcQDFsa4C&dq=The+Leadership+Secrets+of+Billy+Graham&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit of the Silent Butler","description":"What can cure can kill.

How can one regain equilibrium in the face of absences such as dementia and death? We have to keep moving, even while realizing that the loss of mind and body is the natural conclusion. At the beginning of the first poem Frost invokes the image of an empty or abandoned beehive: Pretty to think of the mind at its end as a metaphysician beekeeping after the leaves have fallen at autumn's end. The bee metaphor is handled brilliantly and subtly throughout the collection as a reminder of how often our constant activity, whether it is mental or physical, is taken for granted. Frost continues her investigation of the mortal plight by entering into a Dantesque descent into the ebb and flow of the seascape. Body consumes body over and over again as fish are caught and killed and the poet observes the flora and fauna as they partake in the darker cycles of nature. A long narrative poem about the Spanish explorer de Baca and his harrowing travels from southern Florida to Mexico powerfully reinforces the certainty of consumption and loss as it comments on the colonizing of the new world. In the final section, Frost returns once more to the need for movement and summons the Greek god Pan, who dances a rite of acceptance through a metaphysical landscape on the verge of seasonal change--the bees are not dead, the dark woods are filled with music.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L7LYv60WZ8YC&dq=The+Queen%27s+Desertion:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Hundred Camels in the Courtyard (Paperback)","description":"First published in 1962, A Hundred Camels in the Courtyard by American author Paul Bowles is a book comprising four tales of contemporary life in a land where cannabis, rather than alcohol, customarily provides a way out of the phenomenological world.

The work is especially significant for American constitutional lawyers, political scientists, and for those concerned with serious ideas in American life. Supporters as well as critics of the ACLU will be attracted to this work for different reasons. It is unquestionably the most serious work now available and is likely to remain the touchstone for any such work for many years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FQA7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becky's Horse","description":"Becky must decide whether to keep the horse she won or take the prize money to help an Austrian cousin orphaned during the invasion of Hitler's troops.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CLI35uOTYV4C&dq=Becky%27s+Horse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarah - Book One Of The Canaan Trilogy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"EDGAR ALLAN POE STORIES","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shadows: The life and times of Eliphalet Ball, the founder of the town of Ballston","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NHNWAQAACAAJ&dq=Shadows:+The+life+and+times+of+Eliphalet+Ball,+the+founder+of+the+town+of+Ballston&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic Three of Solatia","description":"All magic has consequences Long ago, the seawitch Dread Mary fell in love with a hard-hearted prince and gave him the Magic Three of Solatia: three silver buttons that could fulfill any wish but at a price.

Along with hundreds of other men, Adams was interned on the Maidstone prison ship and in Long Kesh prison - without charge or trial - during the 1970s for his political activities. Cage Eleven is his own account - sometimes passionate, often humorous - of life in Long Kesh. Written while Adams was a prisoner, the pieces were smuggled out for publication. 'This book is important, not only because it comes from a key player in the Irish political scene, but also because it offers a unique insight into the experience that shaped the consciousness and attitudes of the present generation of Irish republicans - the experience of internment. It offers, too, an unrivalled representation of the resilience and humour that were as much a part of the life of the political prisoner as the adherence to a set of political ideals.'

William F. Hecker, however, is in a unique position to appreciate the influence that military culture and training had on the young poet. A professional artilleryman and a Poe scholar, Hecker offers a lively, nuanced account of Poe's experience as an enlisted soldier and West Point cadet and relates it to his writing, especially his Poems (1831), presented here in facsimile for the first time since 1936. Military service appealed to Poe's romantic sense of adventure, and in 1827 he joined the army under the name Edgar A. Perry. He rose quickly through the ranks -- most notably learning cannon drill -- but suffered as a social misfit in the field and at West Point, where legends about a brilliantly defiant jester still abound. Shortly after being dismissed from the Military Academy for neglecting his duties, Poe published his third book of verse, Poems (1831), which he dedicated to his fellow West Point cadets and funded through subscriptions to them. Hecker explores these events, filling in biographical gaps and drawing connections to Poe's poetic vision. Poe's desire that his poems act as aesthetic bombs -- deranging the senses, striving for Beauty but failing explosively -- emerges as a key theme. With a foreword by poet and Poe critic Daniel Hoffman and an afterword by Gerard A. McGowan addressing the martial element in the poems \\"Tamerlane\\" and \\"To Helen,\\" among others, Private Perry and Mister Poe offers the definitive statement about Poe's military experience while making the early versions of many of his most famous poems widely available.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=94P4x98TtVgC&dq=Private+Perry+And+Mister+Poe:+The+West+Point+Poems,+1831&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deviant Behavior","description":"Deviant Behavior offers an engaging and wide-ranging discussion of deviant behavior, beliefs, and conditions. It examines how the society defines, labels, and reacts to whatever, and whoever, falls under this stigmatizing process thereby providing a distinctly sociological approach to the phenomenon. The central focus in defining what and who is deviant is the audience members of the influential social collectivities that determine the outcome of this process. The discussion in this volume encompasses both the explanatory (or positivist) approach and the constructionist (or labeling) perspectives, thereby lending a broad and inclusive vista on deviance. The central chapters in the book explore specific instances or forms of deviance, including crime, substance abuse, and mental disorder, all of which share the quality that they and their actors, believers, or bearers may be judged by these influential parties in a negative or derogatory fashion. And throughout Deviant Behavior, the author emphasizes that, to the sociologist, the term \\"deviant\\" is completely non-pejorative; no implication of inferiority or inherent stigma is implied; what the author emphasizes is that specific members of the society social circles or collectivities define and treat certain parties in a derogatory fashion; the sociologist does not share in this stigmatizing process but observes and describes it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4YiUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turing Test (Doctor Who Series)","description":"Set during World War II, this story finds the Doctor caught up in the code breaking activities of the Bletchley Park workers.

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive. As his boxing becomes legendary in the city's seedy underworld, packed with wiseguys and loose women, everyone seems to want a hand in Danny's success. Robbins's colorful, fast-talking characters evoke the rough streets of Depression-era New York City. Ronnie, a prostitute ashamed of how far she's fallen and desperately in need of friendship; Sam, a slick bookie who wants to profit from Danny's boxing talent; and Nellie, a beautiful but lonely girl who refuses to believe Danny is beyond redemption -- each of whom has a different vision of Danny's future -- will help steer his rocky course.

The Mound Builders traces the speculation surrounding these monuments and the scientific excavations which uncovered the history and culture of the ancient Americans who built them. The mounds were constructed for religious and secular purposes some time between 1000 B.C. and 1000 A.D., and they have prompted curiosity and speculation from very early times. European settlers found them evidence of some ancient and glorious people. Even as eminent an American as Thomas Jefferson joined the controversy, though his conclusions that the mounds were actually cemeteries of ancient Indians remained unpopular for nearly a century. Only in the late 19th century, as Smithsonian Institution investigators developed careful methodologies and reliable records, did the period of scientific investigation of the mounds and their builders begin. Silverberg follows these excavations and then recounts the story they revealed of the origins, development, and demise of the mound builder culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qN8INAAACAAJ&dq=MOUND+BUILDERS+THE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cookie Kisses (Sesame Beginnings)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=knyPGgAACAAJ&dq=Cookie+Kisses+(Sesame+Beginnings)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Labrador Retriever (Howell Dog Book of Distinction)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mastering IBM WebSphere Portal: Expert Guidance to Build and Deploy Portal Applications","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Golden Anniversary Bibliography of Edgar Rice Burroughs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y_MIOQAACAAJ&dq=A+Golden+Anniversary+Bibliography+of+Edgar+Rice+Burroughs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cloud Mountain","description":"California, 1906.

(health effects of smoking): An article from: Medical Update","description":"Some people suffer from chronic, debilitating disorders for which no conventional treatment brings relief. Can marijuana ease their symptoms? Would it be breaking the law to turn to marijuana as a medication? There are few sources of objective, scientifically sound advice for people in this situation. Most books about marijuana and medicine attempt to promote the views of advocates or opponents. To fill the gap between these extremes, authors Alison Mack and Janet Joy have extracted critical findings from a recent Institute of Medicine study on this important issue, interpreting them for a general audience. Marijuana As Medicine? provides patients--as well as the people who care for them--with a foundation for making decisions about their own health care. This empowering volume examines several key points, including: Whether marijuana can relieve a variety of symptoms, including pain, muscle spasticity, nausea, and appetite loss. The dangers of smoking marijuana, as well as the effects of its active chemical components on the immune system and on psychological health. The potential use of marijuana-based medications on symptoms of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and several other specific disorders, in comparison with existing treatments. Marijuana As Medicine? introduces readers to the active compounds in marijuana. These include the principal ingredient in Marinol, a legal medication. The authors also discuss the prospects for developing other drugs derived from marijuana's active ingredients. In addition to providing an up-to-date review of the science behind the medical marijuana debate, Mack and Joy also answer common questions about the legal status of marijuana, explaining the conflict between state and federal law regarding its medical use. Intended primarily as an aid to patients and caregivers, this book objectively presents critical information so that it can be used to make responsible health care decisions. Marijuana As Medicine? will also be a valuable resource for policymakers, health care providers, patient counselors, medical faculty and students--in short, anyone who wants to learn more about this important issue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mx25ykLnt7MC&dq=Where+there%27s+smoke....+(health+effects+of+smoking):+An+article+from:+Medical+Update&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simplified Russian Grammar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AopRAQAAMAAJ&dq=Simplified+Russian+Grammar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legend of Rah and the Muggles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Man Walks Into a Room","description":"Found wandering in the desert outside of Las Vegas, Samson Greene, a thirty-six-year-old Columbia University English professor, is discovered to have a brain tumor, but when surgery removes the tumor, leaving him with no recollection of his life after the age of twelve, he finds himself struggling to deal with a life, and a wife, he no longer recognizes.

But I am neither. I am simply a watcher of Israel and the messenger of El Shaddai. When He speaks to me in dreams, I interpret. When He whispers a melody, I sing. At eighty-six, Miriam had devoted her entire life to loving El Shaddai and serving His people as both midwife and messenger. Yet when her brother Moses returns to Egypt from exile, he brings a disruptive message. God has a new name  Yahweh  and has declared a radical deliverance for the Israelites. Miriam and her beloved family face an impossible choice: cling to familiar bondage or embrace uncharted freedom at an unimaginable cost. Even if the Hebrews survive the plagues set to turn the Nile to blood and unleash a maelstrom of frogs and locusts, can they weather the resulting fury of the Pharaoh? Enter an exotic land where a cruel Pharaoh reigns, pagan priests wield black arts, and the Israelites cry out to a God they only think they know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L6hVCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grand Finales: The Art of the Plated Dessert","description":"Grand Finales The Art of The Plated Dessert by Tish Boyle and Timothy Moriarty Feast your eyes on the most exquisite and flavorful desserts created by fifty of the country's renowned pastry chefs in this groundbreaking new book, Grand Finales: The Art of The Plated Dessert. Authors Tish Boyle and Timothy Moriarty have written a book that will change the course of culinary history-they have formally identified the different \\"schools\\" of pastry in relation to the world of art and design. From Neo-Classicist to the Impressionist to the Modernist and Fusionist dessert, the result-a grand look at the extraordinary plated desserts being created today. As Michael Schneider, editor-in-chief of Pastry Art & Design and Chocolatier magazines, and creator of the book observes, \\"The concept of the plated dessert is best understood if you visualize tile plate as the canvas and the components as the medium with which the chefs ?paint.' Although beautiful presentation is integral to the concept, a plated dessert is created not so much as to be exhibited as to be eaten.\\" In this enticing new book, each master pastry chef offers a delectable recipe, accompanied by an elegant four-color photograph of the transcendent work. We are also given a privileged look behind the scenes where chefs share their most guarded secrets. To all pastry lovers and aesthetes alike, the authors of Grand Finales: The Art of The Plated Dessert assure ultimate satisfaction or they will eat their hat-Eric GirTrd's creation of Humphrey Bogart's hat-that is.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TeEIAAAACAAJ&dq=Grand+Finales:+The+Art+of+the+Plated+Dessert&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Platon's Republic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Treasures on Earth","description":"Would the world be a better place if human societies were somehow able to curb their desires for material goods? Saleem Ali's pioneering book links human wants and needs by providing a natural history of consumption and materialism with scientific detail and humanistic nuance. It argues that simply disavowing consumption of materials is not likely to help in planning for a resource-scarce future, given global inequality, development imperatives, and our goals for a democratic global society. Rather than suppress the creativity and desire to discover that is often embedded in the exploration and production of material goods--which he calls the treasure impulse--Ali proposes a new environmental paradigm, one that accepts our need to consume treasure for cultural and developmental reasons, but warns of our concomitant need to conserve. In evaluating the impact of treasure consumption on resource-rich countries, he argues that there is a way to consume responsibly and alleviate global poverty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hb2iJQhcJF4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gulliver's Travels Into Several Remote Nations of the World","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=emISbmWjamwC&dq=Gulliver%27s+Travels+Into+Several+Remote+Nations+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Buzzards Fly (Louis L'Amour)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k4VUDQEACAAJ&dq=Where+Buzzards+Fly+(Louis+L%27Amour)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Mustang (Preserve Our Wildlife Series)","description":"Recounts the life and fight for survival of a typical American wild mustang from birth to maturity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ww_gPAAACAAJ&dq=The+American+Mustang+(Preserve+Our+Wildlife+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smara, the Forbidden City: Being the Journal of Michel Vieuchange While Travelling Among the Independent Tribes of South Morocco and Rio De Oro (Ecco Travels)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Natural Pregnancy Book: Herbs, Nutrition, and Other Holistic Choices","description":"Reading The Natural Pregnancy Book is like having your own personal herbalist and midwife at your side.

When her bond is purchased by an enigmatic nobleman, she is trained in history, theology, politics, foreign languages, the arts of pleasure. And above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Exquisite courtesan, talented spy... and unlikely heroine. But when Ph dre stumbles upon a plot that threatens her homeland, Terre d'Ange, she has no choice. Betrayed into captivity in the barbarous northland of Skaldia and accompanied only by a disdainful young warrior-priest, Ph dre makes a harrowing escape and an even more harrowing journey to return to her people and deliver a warning of the impending invasion.

This year, plans include a re-enactment of the original battle and a colonial craft fair. Meg Langslow has returned to her home town for the festivities--and to sell her wrought-iron works of art. Except, of course, for the pink-painted flamingos she reluctantly made for her mother's best friend--she's hoping to deliver them secretly, so she won't get a reputation as \\"the blacksmith who makes those cute wrought-iron flamingos.\\" Besides, she has taken on another responsibility--making sure none of her fellow crafters ruin the historical authenticity of the fair with forbidden modern devices--like wrist watches, calculators, or cell phones. She's only doing it to keep peace with the mother of the man she loves. And Michael himself will don the white-and-gold uniform of a French officer for the re-enactment--what actor could resist a role like that? Meg's also trying to keep her father from scaring too many tourists with his impersonation of an 18th century physician. And to prevent a snooping reporter from publishing any stories about local scandals. Not to mention saving her naive brother, Rob, from the clutches of a con man who might steal the computer game he has invented.

She charges that the basic elements of the new welfare policy subordinate poor single mothers in a separate system of law. Mink points to the racial, class, and gender biases of both liberals and conservatives to explain the odd but sturdy consensus behind welfare reforms that force the poor single mother to relinquish basic rights and compel her to find economic security in work outside the home. Mink explores how and why we should cure the unique inequality of poor single mothers by reorienting the emphasis of welfare policy away from regulating mothers to rewarding the work they do. Every mother is a working mother, the bumper sticker proclaims, but the work mothers do pays no wages. Mink argues that women's equality depends on economic support for caregivers'work. Welfare's End challenges the ways in which policymakers define the problem they seek to cure. While legislators assume that something is wrong with poor single mothers, Mink insists that something is wrong with a system that invades their rights and negates their work. Showing how welfare reform harms women, Mink invites the design of policies to promote gender justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yFhuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Welfare%27s+End+(Cornell+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"READER'S DIGEST ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO GARDENING","description":"A guide to landscape gardening, indoor gardening, and growing vegetables and fruits.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZrzbxwEACAAJ&dq=READER%27S+DIGEST+ILLUSTRATED+GUIDE+TO+GARDENING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nobody's Hero (Rebels & Rogues) (Harlequin Temptation, No 582)","description":"Nobody's Hero by Patricia Keelyn released on Feb 23, 1996 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lo4vaMTgcfUC&dq=Nobody%27s+Hero+(Rebels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cat Raise the Dead: A Joe Grey Mystery","description":"Joe Grey can't believe his human housemate Clyde would even consider volunteering him for the Animal Therapy program at the local nursing home, just when Joe was on the verge of solving the string of burglaries that has Molena Point residents shaking in their collective boots.

Drawing on interviews with critics from such venues as the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Washington Post, Phillipa Chong delves into the complexities of the review-writing process, including the considerations, values, and cultural and personal anxieties that shape what critics do. Chong explores how critics are paired with review assignments, why they accept these time-consuming projects, how they view their own qualifications for reviewing certain books, and the criteria they employ when making literary judgments. She discovers that while their readers are of concern to reviewers, they are especially worried about authors on the receiving end of reviews. As these are most likely peers who will be returning similar favors in the future, critics  fears and frustrations factor into their willingness or reluctance to write negative reviews. At a time when traditional review opportunities are dwindling while other forms of reviewing thrive, book reviewing as a professional practice is being brought into question. Inside the Critics  Circle offers readers a revealing look into critics  responses to these massive transitions and how, through their efforts, literary values get made.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HVOjDwAAQBAJ&dq=Book+Reviewing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Follow the River","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"NeXTSTEP Object-Oriented Programming and the Objective C Language, Release 3 (NeXTSTEP Developer's Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M5JQAAAAMAAJ&dq=NeXTSTEP+Object-Oriented+Programming+and+the+Objective+C+Language,+Release+3+(NeXTSTEP+Developer%27s+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaleidoscope (Ldp Litterature) (French Edition)","description":"Tokyo Junkie is a memoir that plays out over the dramatic 60-year growth of the megacity Tokyo, once a dark, fetid backwater and now the most populous, sophisticated, and safe urban capital in the world.

This ambitious work examines changes in religious beliefs, in motives for work, in the issues that give rise to political conflict, in the importance people attach to having children and families, and in attitudes toward divorce, abortion, and homosexuality. Ronald Inglehart's earlier book, The Silent Revolution (Princeton, 1977), broke new ground by discovering a major intergenerational shift in the values of the populations of advanced industrial societies. This new volume demonstrates that this value shift is part of a much broader process of cultural change that is gradually transforming political, economic, and social life in these societies. Inglehart uses a massive body of time-series survey data from twenty-six nations, gathered from 1970 through 1988, to analyze the cultural changes that are occurring as younger generations gradually replace older ones in the adult population. These changes have far-reaching political implications, and they seem to be transforming the economic growth rates of societies and the kind of economic development that is pursued.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nf9ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gun Digest Book of Guns for Personal Defense: Arms & Accessories for Self-Defense","description":"Personal protection is a hot topic today, and current, complete information on the handguns used for it is in great demand.

When Noor Khan s father, a teacher of mystical Sufism, dies, Noor is forced to bow, along with her mother, sister and brother, to her uncle s religious literalism and ideas on feminine propriety. While at the Sorbonne, Noor falls in love with Armand, a Jewish musician. Though her uncle forbids her to see him, they continue meeting in secret. When the Germans invade in 1940, Armand persuades Noor to leave him for her own safety. She flees with her family to England, but volunteers to serve in a special intelligence agency. She is trained as a radio operator for the group that, in Churchill s words, will  set Europe ablaze  with acts of sabotage. She is then sent back to Occupied France. Unwavering courage is what Noor requires for her assignment and her deeply personal mission   to re-unite with Armand. As her talisman, she carries her grandmother s gift, an heirloom tiger claw encased in gold. The novel opens in December 1943. Noor has been imprisoned. She begins writing in secret, tracing the events that led to her capture. When Germany surrenders in 1945, her brother Kabir begins his search through the chaos of Europe s Displaced Persons camps to find her. In its portrayal of intolerance, The Tiger Claw eerily mirrors our own times, and progresses with moments of great beauty and white-knuckle tension towards a moving and astonishing denouement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WrFNbAx1LWIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Beagle","description":"This is Charles Darwin's chronicle of his five-year journey, beginning in 1831, around the world as a naturalist on the H.M.S.

And yet we played on, because we had hope that we might be the lucky ones.\\" In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy stranger at the seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant--and that her lover is married--she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that will echo down through the generations. Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters--strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis--survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history. *Includes reading group guide*","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cxteDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis: Procreation and the Politics of Identity (Old Testament Readings)","description":"Combining insights from social and literary theory as well as traditional historical studies, Mark Brett argues that the first book of the Bible can be read as resistance literature.

This book is an attempt to fill this gap. It focuses on the entrepreneurship-innovation-development nexus, drawing heavily on empirical evidence from developing countries. Cross-country and individual country experiences cover nations as diverse as Ethiopia, India, Turkey, Vietnam, and also examine lessons from advanced economies such as Finland. Three sets of questions are addressed. What is the impact of entrepreneurship and innovation on growth and development? What determines the innovative performance of entrepreneurs in developing countries? What role does the institutional environment play in shaping the extent and impact of innovative activities? A key message is that entrepreneurial innovation, whether through small firms, large national firms, or multinational firms, is often vibrant in developing countries, but does not always realise its full potential. This is due to institutional constraints, the absence of the appropriate mix of different types of small and large and domestic and foreign firms, and insufficiently developed firm capabilities. The contributions provide a better understanding of the determinants and impacts of innovation in developing countries and the policies and institutions that support or hinder innovation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6AFREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning from Las Vegas: The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VIGQtQEACAAJ&dq=Learning+from+Las+Vegas:+The+Forgotten+Symbolism+of+Architectural+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black's Law Dictionary: Deluxe Thumb-Index (Black's Law Dictionary)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gbe7uQEACAAJ&dq=Black%27s+Law+Dictionary:+Deluxe+Thumb-Index+(Black%27s+Law+Dictionary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thanks to My Mother","description":"Susie Weksler was only eight when Hitler's forces invaded her Lithuanian city of Vilnius.

Will her death end the ceaseless plotting against Mary's red-haired cousin, Elizabeth? 1588, the year of the Spanish Armada, is a time of more terror and triumph, not just for queen and court but for the whole of England. The turmoil is reflected in its theatres and under the galleries of inns like London's The Queen's Head where Lord Westfield's Men perform. The scene there on grows even more tumultuous when one of the actors is murdered by a mysterious stranger during a brawl. Nicholas Bracewell, the company's bookholder, a role far wider than mere producer, faces two immediate repercussions. The first is to secure a replacement acceptable to its temperamental star -- and chief shareholder -- Lawrence Firethorn. The second is to keep his promise to the dying Will Fowler and catch his killer. Soon further robberies, accidents, and misfortunes strike Lord Westfield's Men even as their stage successes swell. Bracewell begins to suspect a conspiracy, not a single murderous act, but where lies the proof? Then the players are rewarded with the ultimate accolade -- an appearance at court -- and the canny bookholder senses the end to the drama is at hand.... First published to great acclaim in 1988, The Queen's Head anticipated the lure of bawdy, boisterous, yet elegant epics like Shakespeare in Love. Actor and playwrite Marston has followed with, to date, ten more lusty, historically grounded, theatrically sound Bracewell mysteries that explore the face of England and reveal his deep love for its rich literary and dramatic heritage. The Roaring Boy wasnominated for a 1996 Edgar Award for Best Novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZnEwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Queen%27s+Head+(Missing+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the Land of Fear","description":"Eleven side trips to the dark edge of imagination by master storyteller Harlan Ellison, From the Land of Fear presents some of the author s early work from his start in the late fifties.

The misery in the room and the walk to reach it inspired Wald to establish Henry Street Settlement, which would become one of the most influential social welfare organizations in American history. Through personal narratives, vivid images, and previously untold stories, Ellen M. Snyder-Grenier chronicles Henry Street s sweeping history from 1893 to today. From the fights for public health and immigrants  rights that fueled its founding, to advocating for relief during the Great Depression, all the way to tackling homelessness and AIDS in the 1980s, and into today Henry Street has been a champion for social justice. Its powerful narrative illuminates larger stories about poverty, and who is  worthy  of help; immigration and migration, and who is welcomed; human rights, and whose voice is heard. For over 125 years, Henry Street Settlement has survived in a changing city and nation because of its ability to change with the times; because of the ingenuity of its guiding principle that by bridging divides of class, culture, and race we could create a more equitable world; and because of the persistence of poverty, racism, and income disparity that it has pledged to confront. This makes the story of Henry Street as relevant today as it was more than a century ago. The House on Henry Street is not just about the challenges of overcoming hardship, but about the best possibilities of urban life and the hope and ambition it takes to achieve them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zxm5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Structured On-the-Job Training: Unleashing Employee Expertise into the Workplace","description":"Structured On-the-Job Training offers a practical, easily applicable approach to a crucial but often frustrating process.

Hamilton was a well-known figure on Wall Street. Cornelius Vanderbilt, America's first tycoon, came to respect, grudgingly, his one-time opponent. The day after Vanderbilt's death on January 4, 1877, an almost full-page obituary on the front of the National Republican acknowledged that, in the context of his Wall Street share transactions, \\"There was only one man who ever fought the Commodore to the end, and that was Jeremiah Hamilton.\\" What Vanderbilt's obituary failed to mention, perhaps as contemporaries already knew it well, was that Hamilton was African American. Hamilton, although his origins were lowly, possibly slave, was reportedly the richest colored man in the United States, possessing a fortune of $2 million, or in excess of two hundred and $50 million in today's currency. In Prince of Darkness, a groundbreaking and vivid account, eminent historian Shane White reveals the larger than life story of a man who defied every convention of his time. He wheeled and dealed in the lily white business world, he married a white woman, he bought a mansion in rural New Jersey, he owned railroad stock on trains he was not legally allowed to ride, and generally set his white contemporaries teeth on edge when he wasn't just plain outsmarting them. An important contribution to American history, Hamilton's life offers a way into considering, from the unusual perspective of a black man, subjects that are usually seen as being quintessentially white, totally segregated from the African American past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aP-5BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Railroad Station/Museum Orsay: Scale Architectual Paper Model","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pHFPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Railroad+Station/Museum+Orsay:+Scale+Architectual+Paper+Model&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why we believe in creation, not evolution","description":"2012 Reprint of Original 1959 Edition.

Gouldner: Sociologist and Outlaw Marxist","description":"Published in 1999, this book is an exploration of the life and work of American sociologist Alvin W. Gouldner. Gouldner's life and contribution to legal theory is a case study in the limits of critical, self-reflexive inquiry. Hegel's dialect is a major theme running throughout Gouldner's work, and, even throughout his life, Gouldner himself seemed trapped in the unfolding of the spirit through three distinct stages: 1945-1960 - thesis; 1960-1970 - antithesis; and 1970-1980 - synthesis or new thesis. Implications for creating a reflexive critical sociology in Gouldner's image are discussed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lXp_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call to Love: Meditations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=30mmswEACAAJ&dq=Call+to+Love:+Meditations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"h. m. pulham, esquire","description":"A Harvard reunion prompts a Boston Brahmin s search for meaning in this comedy of manners by the #1 New York Timesbestselling author of Point of No Return. In preparation for the twenty-fifth reunion of his class at Harvard, Harry Pulham is asked to collect and edit the personal histories of his fellow alumni. A glance at the previous year s class book tells him just how tedious the assignment will be:  I have been very busy all this time practising corporation law and trying to raise a family,  a typical entry reads.  I still like to go to the football games and cheer for Harvard.  Harry s autobiography is almost indistinguishable from those of his classmates. From his career at a Boston investment firm to his marriage to childhood friend Kay Motford, he has always made the safe, familiar choice with one exception. For a brief interlude after World War I, Harry joined an advertising agency in Manhattan and fell in love with a beautiful, independent woman unlike anyone he had ever met. A wholly unexpected future opened up for him in those few months, but when family obligations called him back to New England, the relationship came to a sudden end. Now, twenty years later, Harry believes that his story could not have turned out any other way. A clever satire that achieves heartbreaking poignancy, H. M. Pulham, Esquire is a masterpiece from the author declared by the New York Times to be  our foremost fictional chronicler of the well-born.

These keys have now been revealed. \\"The Keys of Jeshua\\" is the culminating presentation of the conversations between artist Glenda Green and Jesus Christ that took place in 1992 while she painted his portrait. He personally appeared to her. (He has appeared many times to others since the day of his resurrection.) Their visits were warm, personal and completely vivid to all the senses. She took extensive notes for her own future study, not realizing that he would eventually ask her to share them with the world. \\"The Keys of Jeshua\\" presents the remaining notes from their original conversations, plus the continuing lessons of subsequent years. More than that, it stands alone as a perfected light of what his teachings have always been. These are the quintessential instructions of the Beloved Master now presented within the context of contemporary language and modern understanding. Each chapter begins with a message from Jeshua. Each message presents a crucial \\"Key to Life.\\" Following that, there is a contribution from the author, correlations with the Bible, other words of wisdom, and practical applications to life. Last, but not least, for subjective realization of the message, each chapter ends with a meditation and prayer. It is recommended that you enjoy this book with all your faculties of understanding, from objective to subjective, and allow a holistic perception of these revelations to develop in your heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UBi6AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Keys+of+Jeshua&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nightmares and dreams: Imperatives for African unity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FfMtAQAAIAAJ&dq=Nightmares+and+dreams:+Imperatives+for+African+unity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready-to-Use Oriental Designs: 495 Different Copyright-Free Designs Printed One Side (Dover Clip Art Ready-to-Use)","description":"Stunning array of flowers, fruits, birds, and patterns with a distinctively Oriental flair offer artists, illustrators, desktop publishers and other producers of printed materials exotic images.

In spite of the efforts of feminist theory and history to turn the tide, this process is with us still. \\"I am the first of a new genus\\" (Mary Wollstonecraft). \\"When I looked around, I saw and heard of none like me\\" (Mary Shelley). \\"I look everywhere for grandmothers and find none\\" (Elizabeth Barrett Browning). \\"Why isn't there a tradition of the mothers?\\" (Virginia Woolf). \\"Women have 'no past, no history'\\" (Simone de Beauvoir). \\"I look for myself throughout the centuries and I don't see myself anywhere\\" (Helene Cixous). As Woolf noted, \\"strange spaces of silence\\" separate the solitary female utterances throughout history. The brutal vicissitudes of the contemporary reception of feminist thinkers, crushed between traditional academia and an anti-intellectualism that describes itself as activism, are symptoms of the fact that the conditions, which produced the \\"strange spaces of silence\\" and made the repetitive generic loneliness from Wollstonecraft to Cixous possible, are still operative. They have found their way into the present age as \\"reactionary conformity that manages to discredit any notion of feminine specificity or freedom that is not based on seductionwhich means not based on reproduction and consumption\\" (Kristeva). The intertextual approach to Kristeva and Woolf brings to light \\"matricide\\" as the silent engine behind the stammering of female temporality. \\"Matricide\\" is offered as an entrance to the conceptualization of the cultural ramifications of a language that wavers between hypnotic passion and murder. As Joan Scott has demonstrated, the oscillations between phantasies of uniqueness and phantasies of fusion are characteristic of women's movements. Matricide in Language claims that these fantasies are subtended by imaginary matricide and that they can explain the extreme discursive practices that are characteristic of the debate in and around feminism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRjzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beria-My Father: Life Inside Stalin's Kremlin","description":"This book is a memoir of the daily life of two men from Georgia--Stalin and Beria--who sent millions to their graves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DhUhAQAAMAAJ&dq=Beria-My+Father:+Life+Inside+Stalin%27s+Kremlin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holy Face in the Way of the Cross","description":"This is a new release of the original 1941 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LQxongEACAAJ&dq=The+Holy+Face+in+the+Way+of+the+Cross&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chicago Review Press NCLEX-PN: Practice Test and Review (Book with Diskette for Windows) with Disk (NCLEX-PN Practice Test & Review)","description":"Fully revised to conform to the 2003 NCLEX Test Plan, this study guide and test includes \\"hot spot,  fill-in-the-blank, and check-the-box questions to reflect the new test format with 10 written practice tests covering all the body systems, plus two additional practice tests on mental health and miscellaneous topics.

Set within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett's mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. \\"All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.\\" It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance and the subsequent cover-up will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt. In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \\"what if\\" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1PE0DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+mothers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Allowance Chore Checks","description":"Now you and your children can track their chores and when they've been paid.

And yet the best ways of understanding and managing this process have never been properly studied. The Screenplay Business is the first book to do exactly that, addressing such questions as: How do film scripts get written, and what are the tensions between creativity and business? How can the team of the writer, producer, director and development executive work together most effectively? The Screenplay Business presents a theoretical and practical framework for understanding the business of independent script development, and encompasses ideas about creativity, motivation, managing creative people, value chains, and MBA leadership theories. This book will help producers and writers to nurture their stories through the long development process to the screen. It explains the international film business, and contains new research and extensive interviews with leading industry figures, including practical advice on how to run script meetings and handle notes; how to build a sustainable business; and how to understand what really happens when a script is written. The Screenplay Business is a new key text for academics and students researching film and media, and indispensable reading for anyone working in film screenplay development today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pmt4SDShRqEC&dq=The+Big+Deal:+Hollywood%27s+Million-Dollar+Spec+Script+Market&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clean & Simple 2 - the Sequel","description":"Named a Best Book of 2020 by NPR and Vanity Fair One of Smithsonian's Ten Best Science Books of 2020  A searching and vital explication of germ theory, social norms, and what the modern era is really doing to our bodies and our psyches.   Vanity Fair A preventative medicine physician and staff writer for The Atlantic explains the surprising and unintended effects of our hygiene practices in this informative and entertaining introduction to the new science of skin microbes and probiotics. Keeping skin healthy is a booming industry, and yet it seems like almost no one agrees on what actually works. Confusing messages from health authorities and ineffective treatments have left many people desperate for reliable solutions. An enormous alternative industry is filling the void, selling products that are often of questionable safety and totally unknown effectiveness. In Clean, doctor and journalist James Hamblin explores how we got here, examining the science and culture of how we care for our skin today. He talks to dermatologists, microbiologists, allergists, immunologists, aestheticians, bar-soap enthusiasts, venture capitalists, Amish people, theologians, and straight-up scam artists, trying to figure out what it really means to be clean. He even experiments with giving up showers entirely, and discovers that he is not alone. Along the way, he realizes that most of our standards of cleanliness are less related to health than most people think. A major part of the picture has been missing: a little-known ecosystem known as the skin microbiome the trillions of microbes that live on our skin and in our pores. These microbes are not dangerous; they re more like an outer layer of skin that no one knew we had, and they influence everything from acne, eczema, and dry skin, to how we smell. The new goal of skin care will be to cultivate a healthy biome and to embrace the meaning of  clean  in the natural sense. This can mean doing much less, saving time, money, energy, water, and plastic bottles in the process. Lucid, accessible, and deeply researched, Clean explores the ongoing, radical change in the way we think about our skin, introducing readers to the emerging science that will be at the forefront of health and wellness conversations in coming years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BK2-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campaigns in Palestine from Alexander the Great (The Schweich lectures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B0deAAAAcAAJ&dq=Campaigns+in+Palestine+from+Alexander+the+Great+(The+Schweich+lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Around the World in Eighty Days (Bantam Classics)","description":"Depicts the adventures of Phineas Fogg and his manservant, Passepartout, on their journey around the world in the late nineteenth century","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FbWTtwEACAAJ&dq=Around+the+World+in+Eighty+Days+(Bantam+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rome (Fleximaps)","description":"Rome Insight FlexiMap features detailed city, street and road maps clearly marked with all the sites and services of particular interest to travelers.

In 1986, Appalachia Educational Labaoratory (AEL), one of nine federally funded research and development laboratories, received funding as part of a \\"rural initiative\\" to address economic decline and educational opportunities in rural areas. The following year, AEL implemented demonstration projects in Braxton County (West Virginia), Charlotte County (Virginia), and two Tennessee and Kentucky counties identified by pseudonyms. The goal of the 2-year project was to help rural schools and communities identify problem areas for school improvement and to analyze community and economic factors contributing to economic decline. Chapter 1 describes methodologies, focal concerns, and project implementation. Chapters 2-5 present the four case studies, focusing on community and school leadership dynamics and providing a historical analysis of each county's economic, political, and sociological context. The last chapter expands on the general theme that previous and current social, economic, and political conditions surrounding rural schools affect present educational conditions and school improvement strategies and practices.

To the outsider, samba and the famous pre-Lenten carnival of which it is the centerpiece seem to showcase the country's African heritage. Within Brazil, however, samba symbolizes the racial and cultural mixture that, since the 1930s, most Brazilians have come to believe defines their unique national identity. But how did Brazil become \\"the Kingdom of Samba\\" only a few decades after abolishing slavery in 1888? Typically, samba is represented as having changed spontaneously, mysteriously, from a \\"repressed\\" music of the marginal and impoverished to a national symbol cherished by all Brazilians. Here, however, Hermano Vianna shows that the nationalization of samba actually rested on a long history of relations between different social groups--poor and rich, weak and powerful--often working at cross-purposes to one another. A fascinating exploration of the \\"invention of tradition,\\" The Mystery of Samba is an excellent introduction to Brazil's ongoing conversation on race, popular culture, and national identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TDve49DRj4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keats' well-read Urn;: An introduction to literary method","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oVrRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Keats%27+well-read+Urn%3B:+An+introduction+to+literary+method&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giant Book Of Tofu Cooking: 350 Delicious & Healthful Recipes","description":"It's been the super food of the East for at least two millennia, and it's finally made a name for itself here.
