Version 9 is the new 64-bit incarnation of SPARC - the most significant change since SPARC's introduction in 1987! Unlike other RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) designs, SPARC specifies not a hardware implementation (\\"chip\\"), but an open, standard architecture belonging to the community of SPARC vendors and users. The SPARC specification is defined by the SPARC Architecture Committee, a technical arm of the computer-maker consortium, SPARC International. Version 9 provides 64-bit data and addressing, support for fault tolerance, fast context switching, support for advanced compiler optimizations, efficient design for Superscalar processors, and a clean structure for modern operating systems. The V9 architecture supplements, rather than replaces, the 32-bit Version 8 architecture. The non-privileged features of Version 9 are upward-compatible from Version 8, so 32-bit application software can execute natively, without modification, on Version 9 systems - no special \\"compatibility mode\\" is required.

Amanda and Marian Laton are identical twins but they are as different as night and day. Amanda is beautiful but nasty, and Marian is kind but plain purposely so to avoid provoking her spiteful twin's jealousy. When their wealthy father suddenly dies, the two gently reared New England heiresses are sent to live with their aunt on a sprawling Texas ranch. There the twins meet Chad Kinkaid, the cowboy son of a neighboring rancher. Marian is fascinated by Chad's rugged good looks and his sheer masculinity, but she knows that like every other man she and her twin have met, he will pursue Amanda, not her. Chad is indeed beguiled by Amanda's beauty, but soon he begins to see beyond Marian's carefully constructed dowdy fa?ade. Unlike the tame gentlemen back East, after witnessing Marian's taste for adventure, her sense of humor and bravery in the face of danger, Chad finds himself wanting her. But how can he, a man who's just a cowboy without fancy airs or urbane charm, convince her she's the only woman for him?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OQn16PLfuAEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Po Man's Child","description":"Told through the eyes of a twenty-seven year old African-American masochistic lesbian named Po, this compelling narrative follows a poetic trail of revelation, sexual perversion, religious fanaticism and the supernatural, to a redeeming conclusion of inner peace.

Richard Rhodes, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb The Great Plague is one of the most compelling events in human history even more so now, when the notion of plague has never loomed larger as a contemporary public concern. The plague that devastated Asia and Europe in the 14th century has been of never-ending interest to both scholarly and general readers. Many books on the plague rely on statistics to tell the story: how many people died; how farm output and trade declined. But statistics can t convey what it was like to sit in Siena or Avignon and hear that a thousand people a day are dying two towns away. Or to have to chose between your own life and your duty to a mortally ill child or spouse. Or to live in a society where the bonds of blood and sentiment and law have lost all meaning, where anyone can murder or rape or plunder anyone else without fear of consequence. In The Great Mortality, author John Kelly lends an air of immediacy and intimacy to his telling of the journey of the plague as it traveled from the steppes of Russia, across Europe, and into England, killing 75 million people one third of the known population before it vanished.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FQ8zpwvojUQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada","description":"Provides concise descriptions of all species and botanical varieties of cultivated plants","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kr0SAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hortus+third:+A+concise+dictionary+of+plants+cultivated+in+the+United+States+and+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Al Partir (Spanish Edition)","description":"BESTSELLER #1 DEL NEW YORK TIMES Mark R.

Mark R. Levin moviliz  a los conservadores en 2009 con Libertad y tiran a, el cual brind  un marco filos fico, hist rico y pr ctico para detener el ataque liberal contra los valores basados en la Constituci n, que hizo su aparici n durante los a?os de Obama.

May, 1940. Britain is at war, European democracies are falling rapidly and the public are unaware of this dangerous new world. Just days after his unlikely succession to Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, faces this horror - and a sceptical King and a party plotting against him. He wonders how he can capture the public mood and does so, magnificently, before leading the country to victory. It is this fascinating period that Anthony McCarten captures in this deeply researched, gripping day-by-day (and often hour-by-hour) narrative. In doing so he revises the familiar view of Churchill - he made himself into the iconic figure we remember and changed the course of history, but through those turbulent and dangerous weeks he was plagued by doubt, and even explored a peace treaty with Nazi Germany. It's a scarier, and more human story, than has ever been told.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-_otDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays and Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HpdBAAAAIAAJ&dq=Essays+and+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Ever Paper Airplanes","description":"Offers advice on making paper airplanes, and shares instructions for making eighteen different models, including the slender, long-nosed Egret; the tiny, fast Pipit; the broad-winged Condor; and the highly maneuverable Mockingbird--a plane just made for airborne stunts.

Author Lynne Falkin McClure describes in clear detail the eight major categories of behavioral clues to violence and includes anecdotes from work settings to help managers and others identify potentially violent employees. Most importantly, she emphasizes the precautions and steps managers must take when they see these  clues  in an employee s behavior and how to create and maintain a work environment that is likely to protect everyone. Including the hiring--appraisal--training process, Risky Business focuses on system-wide, ongoing prevention steps organizations can take to protect everyone in the workplace. The book points out for readers informal organizational  policies that unwittingly encourage potentially dangerous behaviors in employees and then offers alternative  policies that create and maintain a safer environment. Managers, members of personnel, and public relations representatives learn how to deal effectively with the fears of workers and customers should a violent event occur that affects the company s morale and image. However, readers are certain to gain the skills and foresight necessary to avert disaster before it strikes. Lynne Falkin McClure, PhD, is a management consultant, workshop designer/facilitator, and public speaker in Tempe, Arizona. President of McClure Associates Management Consultants, Inc., since 1980, she specializes in work relationships and conducts inhouse workshops for corporations and government agencies.

Finally, the dramatic periods of the Napoleonic Wars and the Risorgimento - the birth of the modern Italian nation - are described here in relation to the island's history, as are the events that led to Sicily's emergence into the modern industrial world. The book includes two appendices comprising a timeline of the long and varied course of Sicilian history; and a travel itinerary covering the full extent of the island and noting the many historic cities and sites described in each chapter.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

But first...Our promise: All of our works are complete and unabridged. As with all our titles, we have endeavoured to bring you modern editions of classic works. This work is not a scan, but is a completely digitized and updated version of the original. Unlike, many other publishers of classic works, our publications are easy to read. You won't find illegible, faded, poor quality photocopies here. Neither will you find poorly done OCR versions of those faded scans either with illegible \\"words\\" that contain all kinds of strange characters like ?, %, &, etc. Our publications have all been looked over and corrected by the human eye. We can't promise perfection, but we're sure gonna try! Our goal is to bring you high quality Christian publications at rock bottom prices.During my five years at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, it fell to my lot to deal with the various aspects of ministerial life and service which are usually included in the term Pastoralia. This involved weekly addresses in Chapel on Saturday evenings, weekly lectures on Pastoral work, addresses at the openings of Terms, and occasional informal 'Conferences' on some of the more outstanding ministerial and pastoral problems.This book embodies the substance of what was then given, and it is reproduced in the hope that those to whom it was originally delivered may like to have a record of what I have reason to know were occasions not without interest; and also that younger brethren in the ministry may find it of some service to compare their own experiences with what they see here as the result of a ministerial life extending (alas! now) over twenty-five years.If some readers should feel surprise at observing that several aspects of ministerial life are not dealt with in these pages, they may perhaps be reminded that my opportunity for treating Pastoral life and work extended at most to only thirty weeks each year, and that therefore with (as a rule) but one address and one lecture a week, it was impossible to cover more of the ground.If, too, any brother in the ministry should be surprised at the comparative absence of reference to problems of Biblical Criticism and of scepticism, and to ways of meeting them, it ought to be said that these were dealt with in the Wycliffe Hall work by means of other courses of lectures.Occasional repetitions may also provoke comment. The explanation is that the entire substance of the book was not given every year and, so, certain subjects were discussed under two or three different headings. But it is hoped that the prime importance of such topics as Prayer and the Bible will be a sufficient justification of any such repeated treatment.One more word of personal explanation seems necessary. Some may think the various sections are unduly brief, but they have been kept so of set purpose. It was thought best to make the book as inclusive as possible, and considerations of space alone necessitated brevity. But far more than this: the book is intended primarily for clergy, and brevity with a view to the reader's own meditation, study, and elaboration appeared in every way best fitted to further the work of the ministry.Ever since my thoughts were first turned in the direction of the ministry, now well over thirty years ago, I have felt a great attraction for all questions dealing with preaching, methods of ministerial work, and problems of teaching and service; and I have read as widely as opportunity has permitted various volumes of Lectures on Preaching and Pastoral work. These chapters are therefore indebted directly and indirectly to very many writers whom it is now impossible to recall and name. But the Bibliography found at the end of this work and the references in certain chapters will serve to show something of the sources and extent of my indebtedness, and also to indicate what may be commended for consideration by brethren in the ministry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SFNcMQAACAAJ&dq=Ministerial+life+and+work+(Notable+books+on+preaching)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early American land companies;: Their influence on corporate development (Publications of the Foundation for Research in Legal History, Columbia University School of Law)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7vQOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Early+American+land+companies%3B:+Their+influence+on+corporate+development+(Publications+of+the+Foundation+for+Research+in+Legal+History,+Columbia+University+School+of+Law)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seeing Myself Seeing the World: A Woman's Journey Around the World on a Bicycle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SnwM2C5u12AC&dq=Seeing+Myself+Seeing+the+World:+A+Woman%27s+Journey+Around+the+World+on+a+Bicycle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Pocket Guide to Familiar Butterflies Of North America","description":"Essays offer a fresh look at common plants, animals, and natural phenomena","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-nXYHD0UgecC&dq=National+Audubon+Society+Pocket+Guide+to+Familiar+Butterflies+Of+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Struggling Readers: Assessment and Instruction in Grades K-6","description":"This practical book focuses on three distinct types of struggling readers that teachers will instantly recognize from their own classrooms--the Catch-On Reader, the Catch-Up Reader, and the Stalled Reader.

But as the miles slipped beneath the tyres of their big BMWs, their troubles started. Exhaustion, injury and accidents tested their strength. Treacherous roads, unpredictable weather and turbulent politics challenged their stamina. They were chased by paparazzi in Kazakhstan, courted by men with very large guns in the Ukraine, hassled by the police, and given bulls' testicles for supper by Mongolian nomads. And yet despite all these obstacles they managed to ride more than twenty thousand miles in four months, changing their lives forever in the process.

In this selection of letters and autobiographical fragments we hear the authentic voices of the three novelist sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, their brother, Branwell, and their father, the Reverend Patrick Bront?. We share in their progress over the years: the exuberant childhood, absorbed in wild, imaginative games; the years of struggling to earn a living in uncongenial occupations before Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall took the literary world by storm; the terrible marring of that success as, one by one, Branwell, Emily and Anne died tragically young; the final years as Charlotte, battling against grief, loneliness and ill health, emerged from anonymity to take her place in London literary society and, finally, found an all too brief happiness in marriage to her father's curate. Juliet Barker, author of the highly acclaimed biography The Bront?s has used her unrivalled knowledge of the family to select extracts from letters and manuscripts, many of which are appearing here in print for the first time. Charlotte was a letter-writer of supreme ability, ranging from facetious notes and homely gossip to carefully composed pages of literary criticism and, most movingly of all, elegiac tributes to her beloved brother and sisters. Emily and Anne remain tantalizingly evasive. Very few of their letters are extant. Emily's are mere businesslike notes, though these have been supplemented by her more revealing diary papers; Anne's letters are equally frustrating, but only because their quality makes us regret their paucity. Branwell emerges as distinctly as Charlotte from his letters. Whether trying to impress William Wordsworth with his literary abilities, showing off to his artistic friends or finally coming to terms with a life of failed ambition, his character is laid bare on every page. The Reverend Patrick Bront?'s devotion to his children and passionate advocacy of liberal causes are equally well illustrated in what can only be a small selection from his voluminous correspondence. The Bront? letters are supplemented by extracts from other contemporary sources, which allow us to see the family as their friends and acquaintances saw them. A brief narrative text guides the reader through the letters and sets them in context. By allowing the Bront?s to tell their own story, Juliet Barker has not only produced an innovative form of biography but also given us the unique privilege of participating intimately in the lives of one of the most famous and best-loved families of English literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rLoCCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animation and 3D Modeling on the Mac","description":"Step into the dynamic world of 3D animation.

Summoned to a run-down former strip joint, Delaware and Sturgis find themselves crashing a wild Saints and Sinnersthemed wedding reception. But they re not the only uninvited guests. A horrified bridesmaid has discovered the body of a young woman, dressed to impress in pricey haute couture and accessorized with a grisly red slash around her neck. What s missing is any means of identification, or a single partygoer who recognizes the victim. The baffled bride is convinced the stranger snuck in to sabotage her big day and the groom is sure it s all a dreadful mistake. But Delaware and Sturgis have a hundred guests to question, and a sneaking suspicion that the motive for murder is personal. Now they must separate the sinners from the saints, the true from the false, and the secrets from those keeping them. The party s over and the hunt for whoever killed it is on.  As usual, [Delaware and Sturgis] form a formidable team. Also as usual, the characters here are varied and described with gritty clarity, and the puzzle facing the duo involves a delightful mix of L.A. culture, this time from its dive bars to its much more serious side.

In this prophetic book - first published in 1986 and reproduced here in its original form - he argues that different parts of the  primal adaptive system  develop, regulate and adjust themselves during foetal life and the time around birth and infancy.  Everything which happens during this period of dependence on the mother has an influence on this basic state of health, this primal health.  He suggests that the later well-being of adults, their ability to withstand the  diseases of civilization  such as hypertension, cancer, alcoholism and failures of the immune system resulting in AIDS, allergies and viral diseases, can all be traced back to society s ignorance of the vital importance of the primal period. Since the first edition of this groundbreaking work, research has continued apace, offering further evidence to substantiate Odent s ideas. In the important new Introduction and Postscript, the author reviews recent developments and relates them to the central themes of Primal Health. This book is essential reading for all who care about the health of our children and the ongoing health of society as a whole.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PCJFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MicrosoftOffice 2003 in 10 Simple Steps or Less (10 Steps Or Less)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-27s1nh5388C&dq=MicrosoftOffice+2003+in+10+Simple+Steps+or+Less+(10+Steps+Or+Less)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The wives of Henry the Eighth and the parts they played in history,","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

A repository of the timeless wisdom of the East, Sadhana is one of the most profound books on spirituality that you will ever read! We highly recommend it to any seeker of spiritual wisdom. The book consists of eight essays, in which Tagore answers some of the most profound questions of life: Why did God create this world? Why would a Perfect Being, instead of remaining eternally concentrated in Himself, go through the trouble of manifesting the Universe? Why does evil exist? Do love and beauty have a purpose? Tagore masterfully brings the spiritual truths behind these profound questions to light, with his lucid explanations of the Sanskrit verses of the Upanishads (Indian spiritual texts dating to ~800 B.C.) and the eternal teachings of Lord Jesus and Buddha. Sadhana is one of those rare books that need to be read slowly, as each sentence contains an immense amount of wisdom to be digested! In the end Tagore's captivating and rational explanations will leave you feeling breathless, exhilarated and brimming with peace, happiness and joy, as you become aware of the tremendous unifying force behind this immensely diverse and awe-inspiring Creation!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L5hsAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uzbekistan: The Golden Road to Samarkand (Odyssey Illustrated Guide)","description":"No one should visit Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva or indeed Central Asia without this meticulously researched and gorgeously illustrated guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jxDvnQEACAAJ&dq=Uzbekistan:+The+Golden+Road+to+Samarkand+(Odyssey+Illustrated+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Funeral and Memorial Service Readings, Poems, and Tributes","description":"A collection of poetry and prose appropriate for reading at a funeral or memorial service offers tributes for mothers, fathers, children, spouses, friends, relatives, soldiers, pets, and general readings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XsEyLbWjvqAC&dq=Funeral+and+Memorial+Service+Readings,+Poems,+and+Tributes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music Fundamentals","description":"Musical theatre students and performers are frequently asked to learn musical material in a short space of time; sight-read pieces in auditions; collaborate with accompanists; and communicate musically with peers, directors, music directors and choreographers. Many of these students and performers will have had no formal musical training. This book offers a series of lessons in music fundamentals, including theory, sight-singing and aural tests, giving readers the necessary skills to navigate music and all that is demanded of them, without having had a formal music training. It focuses on the skills required of the musical theatre performer and draws on musical theatre repertoire in order to connect theory with practice. Throughout the book, each musical concept is laid out clearly and simply with helpful hints and reminders. The author takes the reader back to basics to ensure full understanding of each area. As the concepts begin to build on one another, the format and process is kept the same so that readers can see how different aspects interrelate. Through introducing theoretical ideas and putting each systematically into practice with sight-singing and ear-training, the students gain a much deeper and more integrated understanding of the material, and are able to retain it, using it in voice lessons, performance classes and their professional lives. The book is published alongside a companion website, which offers supporting material for the aural skills component and gives readers the opportunity to drill listening exercises individually and at their own pace. Music Fundamentals for Musical Theatre allows aspirational performers - and even those who aren't enrolled on a course - to access the key components of music training that will be essential to their careers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VpXBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adobe InDesign CS2, Photoshop CS2, and Illustrator CS2, Revealed, Deluxe Education Edition","description":"Provides instructions on using Adobe Photoshop CS2, covering such topics as working with layers, using painting tools, modifying type, adjusting colors, creating special effects, and liquifying an image.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mIbgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Adobe+InDesign+CS2,+Photoshop+CS2,+and+Illustrator+CS2,+Revealed,+Deluxe+Education+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dark Secret","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1DzVtAEACAAJ&dq=A+Dark+Secret&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Adult Videos: How to Watch Adult Videos and Make Your Sex Life Sizzle","description":"The first complete resource to enjoying adult videos and DVDs, featuring more than 100 hot reviews.

After twenty-five years of official secrecy, the story of that dangerous and costly rescue is revealed by a decorated Air Force pilot and Vietnam veteran. Involving personnel from all services, including the Coast Guard, the unorthodox rescue operation claimed the lives of eleven soldiers and airmen, destroyed or damaged several aircraft, and put hundreds of airmen, a secret commando unit, and a South Vietnamese infantry division at risk. It also examines the thorny debates arising from an operation that balanced one man's life against mounting U.S. and South Vietnamese casualties and material losses, the operation's impact on one of the most critical battles of the war, and the role played by search and rescue as America disengaged from that war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rjs9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Fair Barbarian","description":"Distributed by the University of Nebraska Press for the University of Idaho Press Octavia Bassett, a beautiful young heiress from Bloody Gulch, Nevada, unexpectedly descends upon her aunt in the sleepy village of Slowbridge, England.

While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two? or three? semester course sequence or its equivalent.

His poems can be dazzling in their verbal brilliance. They are often shot through with lavish imagery and wit, informed by a lawyer's logic, and disarmingly unexpected: a singing jackrabbit, the seductive Nanzia Nunzio. They also spoke--and still speak--to contemporary concerns. Though his work is popular and his readership continues to grow, many readers encountering it are baffled by such rich and strange poetry. Eleanor Cook, a leading critic of poetry and expert on Stevens, gives us here the essential reader's guide to this important American poet. Cook goes through each of Stevens's poems in his six major collections as well as his later lyrics, in chronological order. For each poem she provides an introductory head note and a series of annotations on difficult phrases and references, illuminating for us just why and how Stevens was a master at his art. Her annotations, which include both previously unpublished scholarship and interpretive remarks, will benefit beginners and specialists alike. Cook also provides a brief biography of Stevens, and offers a detailed appendix on how to read modern poetry. A Reader's Guide to Wallace Stevens is an indispensable resource and the perfect companion to The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens, first published in 1954 in honor of Stevens's seventy-fifth birthday, as well as to the 1997 collection Wallace Stevens: Collected Poetry and Prose.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OKdr0LqW3nsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blott on the Landscape","description":"The landscape is flawless, the trees majestic, the flora and the fauna are right and proper. All is picturesquely typical of rural England at its best. Sir Giles, an MP of few principles and curious tastes, plots to destroy all this by building a motorway smack through it, to line his own pocket and at the same time to dispose of his wife, the capacious Lady Maude. But Lady Maude enlists a surprising ally in her enigmatic gardener Blott, a naturalised Englishman in whom adopted patriotism burns bright. Lady Maude's dynamism and Blott's concealed talents enable them to meet pressure with mimicry, loaded tribunals with publicity and chilli powder, and requisition orders with wickedly spiked beer. This explosively comic novel will gladden the heart of everyone who has ever confronted a bureaucrat, and spells out in riotous detail how the forces of virtue play an exceedingly dirty game when the issue is close to home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O4zi3BTlDO4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Stranger's Kiss (An Avon Romantic Treasure)","description":"A spy for the British is sent to pick the brains of a beautiful, thoroughly amnesiac French scientist lying in a Paris hospital and finds himself torn between his country and the woman who trusts him with her life.

It also means exchanging a clinical company flat for the pretty but overgrown garden of Ivy Cottage, and the constant attentions of her interfering sister Hilary. Most of all it means Alex, Ivy Cottage's drop-dead-gorgeous tenant, with whom Hilary is determined Charlotte should find love anew, and whose charming exterior hides his own secret tragedy...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vFhMjUUNuScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Compass: Inventions That Changed Our Lives","description":"Traces the history of the compass from its invention by the ancient Chinese through its use by early explorers to modern uses and developments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m3mlNwAACAAJ&dq=The+Compass:+Inventions+That+Changed+Our+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide for Young People","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZhZZAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Guide+for+Young+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis: Secrets of Creation","description":"How was the world created? Battle lines are currently drawn between two dogmatic camps: the fundamentalist 'Creationists' who believe that creation took place in six days, and the scientific reductionists who expound theories of 'big bangs' and so on. From a direct spiritual perception of the facts, Rudolf Steiner presents a new perspective which transcends these bipolar arguments. He affirms that clairvoyant research accords with the biblical descriptions, but he emphasizes that the text of Genesis has to be interpreted in a special way. In this extraordinary document, Steiner speaks of the six days of creation as a reawakening of the previous phases of the Earth's development. He describes the work of mighty spiritual entities called the Elohim, and how they co-operated with other spiritual hierarchies in the creation of Earth. He also clarifies the relationship of the Elohim and the biblical Jehovah. In addition, Steiner discusses themes of light and darkness, the meaning of Adam and Eve, the 'day of rest' on the seventh day, the stages of human development on Earth, and the special character of the Hebrew language. Also featured in this new edition is a previously unpublished introductory lecture on the meaning of mystery drama.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uCFFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of Both Worlds","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dfIQuQAACAAJ&dq=Best+of+Both+Worlds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christmas Anna angel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sk9JxwEACAAJ&dq=The+Christmas+Anna+angel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rob Roy (Penguin Classics)","description":"First pub 1817.

In 2007 the Discovery Channel produced and broadcast a documentary called The Lost Tomb of Jesus, raising interest   and controversy -- among the public and specialists alike. Could this actually be the tomb of Jesus and his family? In January of 2008 a group of internationally renowned scholars from a broad range of disciplines met in Jerusalem to discuss that very question. Covering the archaeological facts about the discovery, Jewish burial customs during the late Second Temple period, first-century inscriptions, the Talpiot tomb, the James ossuary, the Holy Sepulcher, and more,this volume presents their expert perspectives on a much-publicized topic.

Now her husband has disappeared, leaving behind a trail of blood, and she's the number-one murder suspect with no one to turn to for help. San Francisco attorney Nina Reilly is also on the run from a bad marriage and a worse career setback.

Exploring the ways that shared musical practices transmit social knowledge, Conventional Wisdom offers an account of our own cultural moment in terms of two dominant traditions: tonality and blues.McClary looks at musical history from new and unexpected angles and moves easily across a broad range of repertoires--the blues, eighteenth-century tonal music, late Beethoven, and rap. As one of the most influential trailblazers in contemporary musical understanding, McClary once again moves beyond the borders of the \\"purely musical\\" into the larger world of history and society, and beyond the idea of a socially stratified core canon toward a musical pluralism. Those who know McClary only as a feminist writer will discover her many other sides, but not at the expense of gender issues, which are smoothly integrated into the general argument. In considering the need for a different way of telling the story of Western music, Conventional Wisdom bravely tackles big issues concerning classical, popular, and postmodern repertoires and their relations to the broader musical worlds that create and enjoy them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nSg0P8GJL7gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis (Mathematical Surveys and Monographs)","description":"This book lays the foundations of differential calculus in infinite dimensions and discusses those applications in infinite dimensional differential geometry and global analysis not involving Sobolev completions and fixed point theory.

In the same spirit, calculus of holomorphic mappings (including Hartogs' theorem and holomorphic uniform boundedness theorems) and calculus of real analytic mappings are developed. Existence of smooth partitions of unity, the foundations of manifold theory in infinite dimensions, the relation between tangent vectors and derivations, and differential forms are discussed thoroughly. Special emphasis is given to the notion of regular infinite dimensional Lie groups.Many applications of this theory are included: manifolds of smooth mappings, groups of diffeomorphisms, geodesics on spaces of Riemannian metrics, direct limit manifolds, perturbation theory of operators, and differentiability questions of infinite dimensional representations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l-XxBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brothers Campbell","description":"The autobiography of the best-loved UB40 brothers Born and raised in a council house on Birmingham's notorious Balsall Heath under the watchful eye of their staunchly socialist, folk singer father, Robin and Ali Campbell were to become members of the most successful reggae band in the world, a career that has spanned four decades.

Instilled by their father from an early age to always do things their own way the brothers - in between dead end jobs and the dole office - put together a band that would show Balsall Heath what reggae was all about . Mismanagement, drink, drugs, divorce, paranoia and jail terms would dog the band and threaten to destroy it all - including the brother's relationship and yet they come to amass record sales in excess of 50 million, with nearly 50 hit singles to their credit - from 'Red Red Wine' and 'Don't Break My Heart' to 'Homely Girl' and 'I Got You Babe'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LWeEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Brothers+Campbell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diary of Richard Wagner 1865-1882: The Brown Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6QIMAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Diary+of+Richard+Wagner+1865-1882:+The+Brown+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hurst's the Heart, Arteries and Veins (Single Volume)","description":"Enhance your clinical decision-making today with the landmark volume that continues to define cardiology!

It is argues that this is the main characteristic distinguishing between behaviorism and mentalistic cognitivism. The answer posed by the author is that, with few exceptions and for the most fundamental reasons, mental processes are not accessible and that any psychology, such as contemporary cognitivism, based on a putative analysis of mind into its mental components must be fallacious. Classic and modern arguments against both mentalism and behaviorism are reviewed. In general, it is concluded that most antibehaviorist arguments are based on second order humanistic considerations rather than those underlying the usual scientific standards. Behaviorism represents the best that can be done in a situation of fundamental immeasurability and uncertainty. A modern version is offered in the final chapter of this book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cop5AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Therapeutic family law;: A complete guide to marital reconciliations,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSwhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Someone Bigger","description":"Sam's dad says that he is too small to fly their new kite, but when Dad, the postman, a bank robber, and some zoo animals get pulled up into the sky, only Sam can save them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6vLWWnLOcsAC&dq=Someone+Bigger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enciclopedia Mega-Junior (Spanish Edition)","description":"An illustrated encyclopedia exploring topics in history, geography, science, English, math, and the arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EIARVcA5S1kC&dq=Enciclopedia+Mega-Junior+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Goddess Re-Awakening: The Feminine Principle Today","description":"This anthology, with essays by Riane Eisler, June Singer, and others, considers Goddess myths, current psychological perspectives, and the feminine principle in spirituality today.

As a result, the man who became a legend at places like Bull Run, the Shenandoah Valley, and Chancellorsville had to have his story told by others. This has led to a log of mythologizing and fanciful tales that depict Stonewall as an incredibly pious and occasionally quirky general. Of all the people who wrote about him, none knew them as well as his own widow, Mary Anna Jackson, who wrote a memoir about the famous general.

Soon this haggard SS officer will be dispatched to perform the menial but necessary task of locating and assassinating a degenerate Belgian painter. Join \\"The Dinner Party,\\" where a man stands adrift in a distinctly Borgesian universe, somewhere at the end of time. It could be the Apocalypse or some ghoulish carnival. He's attending a feast at an anonymous mansion while the fall of Babylon is acted out around him, and he struggles to hold on to the faint remnants of his conscience while the world goes up in flames. Turn to a search for \\"The Primordial Face,\\" in which two expatriates, one of them mute, go diving for a mythological treasure at the bottom of the sea and wind up competing for the love of the obsessive expedition leader's young daughter. And spend \\"Sunday Evenings at Contessa Pasquali's,\\" where a man and a woman torture each other with indifference and affection and find that love can be born of terrible schemes. With this volume, Robert Girardi illustrates a world that is both beautifully alluring and brilliantly sinister, where souls are lost and won on the simple weight of everyday decisions. Rich with history and irony, vastly entertaining and told in the timeless style of tales, fables, and myths, these meditations on morality remind us of the eternal human condition.

Here and now, readers can view the entire American experience in Iraq from President Bush Sr.'s 9/11/90 address to Congress (in which he declared the start of a New World Order), through the wars, the inspections, the repeated air campaigns, the failed diplomacy, and finally to Saddam's capture. There are also specific sections showing never-before seen timelines of The Ignored War over the No-Fly Zones in Iraq, and the growth of Al Queda in the New World Order.

But after the Grand Ole Opry moved out of the Ryman Auditorium in the 1970s, Lower Broad deteriorated into a down-and-out skid row.

Drawing on multiple sources, Robert S. Carlsen argues that local Mayan culture survived the Spanish Conquest remarkably intact and continued to play a defining role for much of the following five centuries. He also shows how the twentieth-century consolidation of the Guatemalan state steadily eroded the capacity of the local Mayas to adapt to change and ultimately caused some factions to reject even demonize their own history and culture. At the same time, he explains how, after a decade of military occupation known as la violencia, Santiago Atitl n stood up in unity to the Guatemalan Army in 1990 and forced it to leave town. This new edition looks at how Santiago Atitl n has fared since the expulsion of the army. Carlsen explains that, initially, there was hope that the renewed unity that had served the town so well would continue. He argues that such hopes have been undermined by multiple sources, often with bizarre outcomes. Among the factors he examines are the impact of transnational crime, particularly gangs with ties to Los Angeles; the rise of vigilantism and its relation to renewed religious factionalism; the related brutal murders of followers of the traditional Mayan religion; and the apocalyptic fervor underlying these events.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KXT2tmcwvI8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices in Exile: A Study in Sephardic Intellectual History (The Library of Sephardic History and Thought)","description":"Examines the intellectual life of Sephardic Jewry from the Spanish expulsion in 1492 through the first half of the 20th century.

The other books in the series are The Black Swan, Antifragile, Skin in the Game, and The Bed of Procrustes. Fooled by Randomness is the word-of-mouth sensation that will change the way you think about business and the world. Nassim Nicholas Talebveteran trader, renowned risk expert, polymathic scholar, erudite raconteur, and New York Times bestselling author of The Black Swanhas written a modern classic that turns on its head what we believe about luck and skill. This book is about luckor more precisely, about how we perceive and deal with luck in life and business. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skillthe world of tradingFooled by Randomness provides captivating insight into one of the least understood factors in all our lives. Writing in an entertaining narrative style, the author tackles major intellectual issues related to the underestimation of the influence of happenstance on our lives. The book is populated with an array of characters, some of whom have grasped, in their own way, the significance of chance: the baseball legend Yogi Berra; the philosopher of knowledge Karl Popper; the ancient world s wisest man, Solon; the modern financier George Soros; and the Greek voyager Odysseus. We also meet the fictional Nero, who seems to understand the role of randomness in his professional life but falls victim to his own superstitious foolishness. However, the most recognizable character of all remains unnamedthe lucky fool who happens to be in the right place at the right timehe embodies the  survival of the least fit.  Such individuals attract devoted followers who believe in their guru s insights and methods. But no one can replicate what is obtained by chance.

But radio came roaring back with a whole new concept. The war was over, the baby boom was on, the country was in clover, and a bold new beat was giving the syrupy songs of yesteryear a run for their money. Add transistors, 45 rpm records, and a young man named Elvis to the mix, and the result was the perfect storm that rocked, rolled, and reinvented radio. Visionary entrepreneurs like Todd Storz pioneered the Top 40 concept, which united a generation. But it took trendsetting  disc jockeys  like Alan Freed, Murray the K, Wolfman Jack, Cousin Brucie, and their fast-talking, too-cool-for-school counterparts across the land to turn time, temperature, and the same irresistible hit tunes played again and again into the ubiquitous sound track of the fifties and sixties. The Top 40 sound broke through racial barriers, galvanized coming-of-age kids (and scandalized their perplexed parents), and provided the insistent, inescapable backbeat for times that were a-changin . Along with rock-and-roll music came the attitude that would literally change the  voice  of radio forever, via the likes of raconteur Jean Shepherd, who captivated his loyal following of  Night People ; the inimitable Bob Fass, whose groundbreaking Radio Unnameable inaugurated the anything-goes free-form style that would come to define the alternative frontier of FM; and a small-time Top 40 deejay who would ultimately find national fame as a political talk-show host named Rush Limbaugh. From Hunter Hancock, who pushed beyond the limits of 1950s racial segregation with rhythm and blues and hepcat patter, to Howard Stern, who blew through all the limits with a blue streak of outrageous on-air antics; from the heyday of summer songs that united carefree listeners to the latter days of political talk that divides contentious callers; from the haze of classic rock to the latest craze in hip-hop, Something in the Air chronicles the extraordinary evolution of the unique and timeless medium that captured our hearts and minds, shook up our souls, tuned inand turned onour consciousness, and went from being written off to rewriting the rules of pop culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wxSnv8ZQFBUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advertising in America: The First Two Hundred Years","description":"Everywhere we turn, we are exhorted to spend money, join organizations, rally to causes, or express outrage.

This 15-year-old Irish-American, on convalescent duty and acting as an orderly to General Lovell Rousseau, was recognized for the capture of two guns, several hundred prisoners, and the saving of Fortress Rosecrans in Murfreesboro from the famed Nathan Bedford Forrest. For his actions, young McGee would soon be awarded a Medal of Honor, written up in newspapers and books as a glorious New Jersey legend, be commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Army at age 18, and then, inexplicably at the height of his notoriety, virtually disappear from history for more than 100 years. This is the story of a lost war hero, a man-child with the world at his feet, whose fall from grace is accelerated by fame, lies, alcohol, bigamy, and murder.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vtQuFmi_ifEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing the Divided Self: Clinical and Ericksonian Hypnotherapy for Dissociative Conditions (Norton Professional Book)","description":"Rich in case examples, this book provides a step-by-step guide for the use of hypnotic techniques in the treatment of the entire spectrum of dissociative disorders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uA9pQgAACAAJ&dq=Healing+the+Divided+Self:+Clinical+and+Ericksonian+Hypnotherapy+for+Dissociative+Conditions+(Norton+Professional+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Son Of The Rough South: An Uncivil Memoir","description":"Legendary civil rights reporter Karl Fleming was born in North Carolina's flattest, bleakest tobacco landscape. Raised in a Methodist orphanage during the Great Depression, he was isolated from much of the world around him until an early newspaper job introduced him to the era's brutal racial politics and a subsequent posting as Newsweek's lead civil rights reporter took him to the South's hotspots throughout the 1960s: James Meredith's enrollment at the University of Mississipi, the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, the assassination of Medgar Evers, the murders of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi, and more. On May 17, 1966, Fleming was beaten by black rioters on the streets of Los Angeles. Newsweek covered the incident in their next issue, and here's what they wrote: \\"That he was beaten by Negroes in the streets of Watts was a cruel irony. Fleming had covered the landmark battles of the Negro revolt from Albany, Ga., to Oxford, Miss., to Birmingham, Ala., and numberless way stations whose names are now all but forgotten.... No journalist was more closely tuned into the Movement; once when a Newsweek Washington correspondent asked the Justice Department to name some Dixie hot spots, the Justice man replied,  Ask Fleming. That's what we do.'\\" In Son of the Rough South, Fleming has delivered a stunning, revealing memoir of all the worlds he knew, black, white, violent, and cloistered   and a deeply moving read for anyone interested in any rough South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ad6JswEACAAJ&dq=Son+Of+The+Rough+South:+An+Uncivil+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Celtic Moon Sign Kit: Everything you need to cast a lunar horoscope","description":"CASE DETAILED LUNAR HOROSCOPES FOR YOURSELF, YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS This fun, easy-to-use kit makes Celtic lunar astrology accessible to everyone.

In that capacity, he has listened to people talk about their lives-what works, what doesn't, and the limitless ways (many of them self-inflicted) that people find to be unhappy. He is also a parent twice bereaved; in one thirteen-month period, he lost his eldest son to suicide, his youngest to leukemia. Out of a lifetime of experience, Gordon Livingston has extracted thirty bedrock truths: We are what we do. Any relationship is under the control of the person who cares the least. The perfect is the enemy of the good. Only bad things happen quickly. Forgiveness is a form of letting go, but they are not the same thing. The statute of limitations has expired on most of our childhood traumas. Livingston illuminates these and twenty-four others in a series of carefully hewn, perfectly calibrated essays, many of which focus on our closest relationships and the things that we do to impede or, less frequently, enhance them. Again and again, these essays underscore that  we are what we do,  and that while there may be no escaping who we are, we have the capacity to face loss, misfortune, and regret and to move beyond them-that it is not too late. Full of things we may know but have not articulated to ourselves, Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart offers solace, guidance, and hope to everyone ready to become the person they'd most like to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HufFtAEACAAJ&dq=Now+Is+Not+Too+Late&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Okay, I'll do it myself;: Or, A handywoman's primer that takes the mystique out of home repairs,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5Dg5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Okay,+I%27ll+do+it+myself%3B:+Or,+A+handywoman%27s+primer+that+takes+the+mystique+out+of+home+repairs,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Symbols: An Illustrated Guide to Traditional Images, Icons, and Emblems","description":"An illustrated reference of more than 1,000 decoded symbols.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cYwiAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Symbols:+An+Illustrated+Guide+to+Traditional+Images,+Icons,+and+Emblems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operations Research in Production Planning, Scheduling, and Inventory Control","description":"Textbook","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FZstAAAAIAAJ&dq=Operations+Research+in+Production+Planning,+Scheduling,+and+Inventory+Control&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virginia ghosts,","description":"More than 100 stories from each region of the Old Dominion, crafted by paranormal expert L.B.

Cornel West is an eloquent prophet with attitude.   Newsweek  West reveals himself as a thinker of dazzling erudition, whose critiques are inevitably balanced by an infectious optimism and magnanimity of spirit.   The Village Voice In his major bestseller, Race Matters, philosopher Cornel West burst onto the national scene with his searing analysis of the scars of racism in American democracy. Race Matters has become a contemporary classic, still in print after ten years, having sold more than four hundred thousand copies. A mesmerizing speaker with a host of fervidly devoted fans, West gives as many as one hundred public lectures a year and appears regularly on radio and television. Praised by The New York Times for his \\"ferocious moral vision\\" and hailed by Newsweek as \\"an elegant prophet with attitude,\\" he bridges the gap between black and white opinion about the country's problems. In Democracy Matters, West returns to the analysis of the arrested development of democracy-both in America and in the crisis-ridden Middle East. In a strikingly original diagnosis, he argues that if America is to become a better steward of democratization around the world, we must first wake up to the long history of imperialist corruption that has plagued our own democracy. Both our failure to foster peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis of Islamist anti-Americanism stem largely from hypocrisies in our dealings with the world. Racism and imperial expansionism have gone hand in hand in our country's inexorable drive toward hegemony, and our current militarism is only the latest expression of that drive. Even as we are shocked by Islamic fundamentalism, our own brand of fundamentalism, which West dubs Constantinian Christianity, has joined forces with imperialist corporate and political elites in an unholy alliance, and four decades after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., insidious racism still inflicts debilitating psychic pain on so many of our citizens. But there is a deep democratic tradition in America of impassioned commitment to the fight against imperialist corruptions-the last great expression of which was the civil rights movement led by Dr. King-and West brings forth the powerful voices of that great democratizing tradition in a brilliant and deeply moving call for the revival of our better democratic nature. His impassioned and provocative argument for the revitalization of America's democracy will reshape the terms of the raging national debate about America's role in today's troubled world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZYNzIa9OyQEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The little hunchback Zia","description":"\\"The Little Hunchback Zia\\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett.

Zijn Nobelprijs voor de Vrede, tweehonderd eredoctoraten en de oprichting van het King Memorial bevestigen die positie. In 1964 en 1965 bezocht hij Nederland en ontving een ereprijs uit de handen van koningin Juliana. Toch kwam King vroegtijdig aan zijn einde. Op 4 april 1968 werd hij vermoord door een rabiaat racist. De wereld stond even stil. Aan dit boek werkte Europees Kingdeskundige Willy Schaeken ruim twaalf jaar. Na grondige analyse verbindt hij de moordaanslag met het historische moordklimaat en de moordomstandigheden. De rol van John Edgar Hoover, de Ku Klux Klan, rechtse groeperingen, de oorlog in Vietnam, het Amerikaanse racisme gaat hij niet uit de weg. Uiteindelijk verbindt de auteur Kings laatste levensjaren met zijn personalistische visie en biedt hij een antwoord op de vraag naar Kings levenselixir.  Historian Willy Schaeken has added to his stature as a leading King expert with this insightful account of the civil rights leader s assassination. By placing King s tragic death in the context of twentieth-century American racial relations, he helps readers understand why it happened.  Prof. dr. Clayborne Carson Centennial Professor of History, R. L. Founding Director The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute (Stanford University), bekroond auteur in US en Europa  Although a lone gunman - and no one else - murdered Martin Luther King, Jr., Willy Schaeken shows how J.

Love her or hate her, everyone has a strong opinion about the former first lady turned senator who is almost certainly going to run for president in 2008. Despite more than a dozen years in the national spotlight and more than a dozen unauthorized books about her, she has managed to keep many secrets from the public especially about her turbulent marriage and its impact on her career. There have been plenty of rumors about what Hillary and Bill Clinton did behind closed doors, but never a definitive book that exposes the truth. Bestselling author Edward Klein draws on rare access to inside sources to reveal what Hillary knew and when she knew it during her years as first lady, especially during her husband s impeachment. Klein s book, embargoed until publication, will break news about the choices and calculations she has made over the years. It will also prove that she lied to America in her bestselling autobiography Living History. When she was just a little girl, Hillary Rodham dreamed of becoming the first female president, and her lifelong dream is almost within reach. But just as the swift boat veterans convinced millions of voters that John Kerry lacked the character to be president, Klein s book will influence everyone who is sizing up the character of Hillary Clinton.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outlaw Cook","description":"In essays ranging from his earliest cooking lessons in a cold-water walk-up apartment on New York's Lower East Side to opinions both admiring and acerbic on the food writers of the past ten years, John Thorne argues that to eat exactly what you want, you have to make it yourself.

Voor mij is het even belangrijk als het dagboek van Anne Frank.' - Steve McQueen Solomon Northup, in 1808 als vrij man geboren in New York, wordt in 1841 ontvoerd en in het Zuiden verkocht als slaaf. Twaalf jaar lang werkt hij op plantages in Louisiana, vaak onder de meest wrede omstandigheden, altijd in de hoop zijn vrijheid terug te winnen. In 1853 komt Northup eindelijk vrij. In datzelfde jaar verschijnt 12 jaar slaaf, zijn eigen aangrijpende relaas van zijn gevangenschap in een van de donkerste periodes uit de Amerikaanse geschiedenis. Het boek slaat direct in als een bom en opent vele Amerikanen de ogen voor de onmenselijkheid van het slavernijsysteem. 12 Years a Slave is verfilmd door de Britse filmmaker Steve McQueen en werd geproduceerd door onder anderen Brad Pitt.

Taxonomic changes have been made to reflect the latest scientific information, and the extensive listing of the literature on Texas amphibians and reptiles has been updated through April, 1999. Going back to the writings of French botanist Jean Louis Berlandier, who encountered Texas herpetofauna during his travels from 1828 to 1834, this list covers more than 150 years of inquiry into the state's species and is also testimony to the distinguished careers of such herpetologists as Hobart M. Smith and, more recently, Chris McAllister. Another prominent feature of this book is the more than 150 distribution maps, which show by county the updated distribution records for all native Texas amphibians and reptiles, based on more than 13,000 county records and more than 110,000 individual localities. Professional and amateur herpetologists as well as environmentalists, wildlife specialists, campers, and hikers will find the dichotomous keys useful for identifying species at hand. This aid to identification is supported by a glossary, drawings and photographs, and complete scientific and common names.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-sNcnJoQMD4C&dq=Amphibians+and+Reptiles+of+Texas+(W.+L.+Moody+Jr.+Natural+History+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adam's Bride (Harlequin Presents #263)","description":"When Melody takes a much-needed break, the last thing she expects is to have a passionate vacation affair.

A prophecy of greatness, but it seems that she is destined to walk a path unlike any trodden by a Priestess of Avalon before... Eilan is taken to her father, King Coel, and raised in the Roman way as Helena, but in the year A.D. 259 the ten-yaer-old girl is returned to Avalon, the mystical place of her birth, to begin her training as a priestess and learn the ways of the Goddess. Yet her Aunt Ganeda, now High Priestess, is determined that Helena shall fail. Despite the odds, Helena grows to be a skille healer and a compassionate and gifted priestess, and on the moonlit night of her initiation she sees the face of the Roman, Constantius, the man she will love for the rest of her life. Her vision also reveals that he will be the father of the one whose light will blaze across the world, the one who will free Britannia from Roman tyranny. Constantius is lured to Avalon to fulfil his role in this but Helena joins him in a night of illicit passion. When this deceit is discovered they are banished from Avalon forever. Soon Constantius is drawn back to the politics of Rome, the ill fortunes of war and the irresistible rise of a powerful new religion, and as Helena contends with the dangers that surround them, it seems that the Merlin's prophecy is about to come true...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UWLqooJL4DgC&dq=Priestess+of+Avalon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comes the Blind Fury","description":"A century ago, a gentle blind girl walked the cliffs of Paradise Point.

Among the changes were William Riker's promotion to captain and his new command, Riker's marriage to Counselor Deanna Troi, and Dr. Beverly Crusher's new career at Starfleet Medical. But the story of what set them on a path away from the Starship Enterprise has never been told. UNTIL NOW. It was supposed to be a mission of mercy, until the unthinkable occurred: the destruction of the U.S.S. Juno, killing all hands on board. Starfleet Command has unjustly assessed the actions of Captain Picard and the Enterprise crew during that fateful assignment to the Rashanar Battle Site -- the sector that saw one of the fiercest conflicts of the Dominion War, and which is now a hazardous interstellar graveyard filled with hundreds of devastated starships. While the court-ordered medical evaluation that relieved Picard of command is ongoing, there is growing speculation that his illustrious career may be coming to an end. To clear his former commander, acting captain William Riker and a demoralized skeleton crew agree to conduct a covert operation, and must venture the Starship Enterprise back into Rashanar to track down a mythical menace -- one that may already be responsible for the annihilation of countless fully armed starships. Unbridled hostility and the promise of death lurk at every turn, but they could never imagine that their only chance of survival may lie in the unexpected return of a long-absent friend....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dCMHmKvygroC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Treasury of Words To Live By (Selected and Interpreted By Ninety Eminent Men and Women)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ej8KGQAACAAJ&dq=A+New+Treasury+of+Words+To+Live+By+(Selected+and+Interpreted+By+Ninety+Eminent+Men+and+Women)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transforming #1 : Transforming Number One","description":"The Perfect Antidote to Anxiety Feelings of anxiety can sap your energy, joy, and vitality.

This is subterranean Rome. Though perhaps somewhat less magnificent or picturesque than the city above ground, it is equally - or even more - evocative and fascinating. Like a kind of Atlantis, buried beneath its centuries-old covering, its gardens, temples, baths and nympheums tell us a story of ancient times, made up of light and life, but also of shadows, persecution and death. Here we find the mysterious temples dedicated to the cult of the god Mithras that seem to bring alive the magical atmosphere of initiation and sacrifice. Here too are nympheums, places of pleasure and physical and spiritual refreshment; columbaria with their astonishing funerary architecture; hypogeums and underground passages that still preserve precious works of art beneath churches, palaces, and even in the basements of unpromising-looking houses. However, subterranean Rome does not consist only of mysterious and sacred places, for we also find urban and secular structures like the quarters of the Seventh Cohort of Guards, or the famous Golden House, the Domus Aurea. With evocative photographs - several published here for the first time - this book reveals the hidden world of subterranean Rome, guides us through the most fascinating sites, in many cases previously unvisited, and frequently difficult of access. It represents a journey in time that explores the most ancient roots of western culture.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9GYUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Subterranean+Rome:+Catacombs,+Baths,+Temples+(Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Convection Oven Cookbook","description":"From juicy meats to flaky pastries, your convection oven is the perfect solution for cooking food evenly and fast.

Whether he's translating native languages, assisting his good friend Captain George Rochester as unofficial first mate, or upholding the rule of law as deputy to the sheriff of the port of Virginia, Wiki is never far from the action aboard the seven ships that make up the expedition. But when they encounter a wrecked sealing ship and its desperate crew on the shoals of remote, uninhabited Shark Island, Wiki has little idea just how many of his skills are about to be put to the test. As soon as they board the wreck, a dead body turns up with a dagger firmly inserted between its shoulder blades. And it's not just any dead body: the victim of the brutal murder is none other than the enigmatic captain of the doomed voyage. What's more, Wiki's colleague and nemesis Lieutenant Forsythe is suspected of the crime. Knowing full well that Forsythe is capable of such violence, Wiki nonetheless believes him innocent and is duty-bound to prove it for the good of the expedition. Was the murder a case of mutinous sealers taking the law into their own hands? Did the secrets of several mysterious long-ago voyages finally come back to haunt a dishonest and dishonorable captain? Or is Shark Island home to something more sinister than a few lonely goats? Something isn't quite right about the crew of the wrecked ship, and Wiki will stop at nothing to find out just what it is that they're hiding, and, in the process, unmask a vicious killer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iDsyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success Strategies for Design Professionals: Super Positioning for Architecture and Engineering Firms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qflPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Success+Strategies+for+Design+Professionals:+Super+Positioning+for+Architecture+and+Engineering+Firms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Efrain Rios Montt Servant or dictator?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=can0cQAACAAJ&dq=Efrain+Rios+Montt+Servant+or+dictator%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Up by Rex","description":"Tells how to select and use makeup based on skin type, coloring, face shape, character, and age, and explains special corrective techniques","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p7BW7CjB4z8C&dq=Making+Up+by+Rex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passenger and Immigration Lists Index 2001-2005 ; Cumulated Supplements; Volume 1; A -G: A Guide to the Published Records of More Than 4,444,000 Immigrants Who Came to the New World between the Sixteeenth and the Mid-Twentieth Centuries (Volume 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Highland Bagpipe Tutor, Part 1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fHEBzwEACAAJ&dq=Highland+Bagpipe+Tutor,+Part+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AIA Guide to Chicago","description":"An unparalleled architectural powerhouse, Chicago offers visitors and natives alike a panorama of styles and forms.

While thoroughly updating her original work, Helen Wattley-Ames has maintained her focus in describing the uniqueness of both the Spanish people and their culture and on examining what effect the differences have on the way the Spaniards and Americans relate to and interact with each other. She looks at how Spain has evolved from a travel destination, as source of  sun and cheap wine,  to a dynamic modern society. She depicts a people proud of their accomplishments, yet working hard to maintain valued traditions in the face of increased buying power and more European and American influence. The author begins by looking into Spain s past and at critical dimensions of present day American-Spanish relations. She then explores certain aspects of culture important in cross-cultural interactions: society and the individual; relationships; language and communication; work and play. She ends each chapter with an  encounter  a critical incident that illuminates a situation which may cause misunderstanding, embarrassment or conflict. With extensively updated and revised sections on women (in the workplace in particular), and new sections on minorities and immigrants, and ethics and corruption, the new edition of Spain is Different will be welcomed by anyone looking for clear guidance on how to be most effective in the encounter with the people and culture of Spain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ivh8DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE STING OF DEATH","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WaD6DwAAQBAJ&dq=THE+STING+OF+DEATH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The winner's edge: The critical attitude of success","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7MlXAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+winner%27s+edge:+The+critical+attitude+of+success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autocourse(tm) CHAMP CAR","description":"One of the most renowned and respected titles in motor racing is teaming up with one of the sport's most famous events, to produce the AUTOCOURSE Indianapolis 500(tm) Official Yearbook, the 2003 edition due in September.

This was the raucous War of the Demoiselles, a protest against the national French Forest Code of 1827, which restricted peasants' rights to use state and private forests. Peter Sahlins unravels the fascinating story of this celebrated popular uprising, and in his telling captures the cultural, historical, and political currents that swept the countryside during France's July 1830 Revolution. Sahlins explains how and why the Ari ge peasants drew on the practices and rituals of folk culture, as well as on a revolutionary tradition, to defend their inherited rights to the forest. To explore these rights and their expression, he delves into the history of forest management, of peasant conflicts with the state, and of popular culture--particularly the disputed history of Carnival and of local rituals of justice. Sahlins also sheds new light on the French revolutionary tradition and the \\"Three Glorious Days\\" of July 1830. The drama and symbolism of the War of the Demoiselles have inspired nearly a dozen plays, novels, films, and even a comic book. Using the concepts of anthropology and cultural studies as transport, Sahlins moves from this rich event to the wider worlds of peasant society in France. Focusing on the years from 1829 to 1832 but drawing on sources since the sixteenth century, his book should captivate social, cultural, and political historians of both early modern and modern Europe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t-lnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Rites+of+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Genesis of Doctrine: A Study in the Foundations of Doctrinal Criticism (Bampton Lectures)","description":"Alister E. McGrath begins his book by critically engaging the views of George Lindbeck on doctrine before moving on to present a fresh understanding of the nature and function of Christian doctrine within the church. Particular attention is paid to the way in which doctrine acts as a demarcator between communities of faith, providing important insights into contemporary ecumenical debates. McGrath also explores the crucial issue of the authority of the past in Christian theology, focusing especially on how doctrine serves to maintain continuity within the Christian tradition. The Genesis of Doctrine represents an exploration of a \\"middle way\\" in relation to the significance of Christian doctrine, rejecting both those approaches that insist on the uncritical repetition of the doctrinal heritage of the past and those that disallow the authority of past doctrinal formulations. The book concludes by considering whether doctrine has a future within the church, answering this question in the affirmative on the basis of a number of important theological and cultural considerations.

Millions of readers agreed, and the book became a modern classic. This revised and expanded edition tells the tale. The escape itself was conceived on classical lines. The Greeks built a wooden horse and by means of it got into the city of Troy; in 1943 two British officers built a wooden horse and by means of it got out of a German prison camp. Together with a third companion, they were the only British prisoners ever to escape and reach England from this camp, though many tried. It was Stalag Luft III, designed especially to hold the Germans' most prized captives  Allied aircrew  and considered to be escape-proof. The break from the camp itself is only part of the story. Once outside the wire the escapers were still faced with the problem of getting out of Germany. Fugitives in the midst of a watchful enemy population, they had many close shaves when disaster threatened to overwhelm them  adventures which the reader shares to the full. The fantastic nature of this enterprise, the patience, determination and endurance, above all the steel nerve it demanded from an undernourished physique, are rendered the more impressive by the manner of the telling. The characters are so surely drawn that they could not but be real. Throughout the book runs a vein of humour which alone made those days bearable. The warmth of human companionship born of privation, fear and a common purpose is vividly portrayed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gn2jAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Art Therapy: A Comprehensive Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O-v5jgEACAAJ&dq=Clinical+Art+Therapy:+A+Comprehensive+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trees.","description":"If sociology could teach everyone just one thing, what would it be? What insight about the nature of social life could serve as a gateway to questions that point toward everything we want to know? What could we use as a starting point, a core view of reality on which sociological practice of all kinds is based, consciously or not? The Forest and the Trees is one sociologist's response to the hypothetical -- the core insight with the greatest potential to change how people see the world and themselves in it. It is about what that insight is and why it matters that we understand it, use it, and pass it on. It is about the future of a discipline whose influence and credibility will stand or fall on the ability to foster a clear and widespread understanding of what it means to think sociologically. The Forest and the Trees is an account of how sociological practice finds its way into almost every aspect of life, from headlines in the morning paper to the experiences of growing older to the ravages of social oppression. It is about things small and things large, things simple and things more complex than we can imagine. The Forest and the Trees flows from the tradition of Peter Berger's Invitation to Sociology and C. Wright Mills' Sociological Imagination. It will engage students and teachers alike with a rare and powerful combination of a scholar's feel for the discipline, and a gifted writer's voice that moves and inspires with the immediacy of lived experience, a clear and accessible articulation of the tools of the trade, and a passionate commitment to the promise of sociology to revolutionize how people think about social life and participate in it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mkizTg1KCzoC&dq=The+Trees.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Losing Forever","description":"Jes struggles to balance her life, dealing with her mother's second marriage, her devious soon-to-be stepsister Angela, and her best friend's lovesick behavior.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PUWbRgHI0t4C&dq=Losing+Forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alice of Old Vincennes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HFLHCCCR5NEC&dq=Alice+of+Old+Vincennes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meditation for Optimum Health: How to Use Mindfulness and Breathing to Heal","description":"If you have received a cancer diagnosis, you know that the hundreds of questions and concerns you have about what's to come can be as stressful as the cancer treatment itself.

Long before the March on Washington, Rustin's leadership placed him at the vanguard of social protest.

From Gandhi's impact on African Americans, white supremacists in Congress, and the assassination of Malcolm X to Rustin's never-before-published essays on Louis Farrakhan, affirmative action, and the call for gay rights, Time on Two Crosses chronicles five decades of Rustin's commitment to justice and equality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XUbhoAEACAAJ&dq=Time+on+Two+Crosses:+The+Collected+Writings+of+Bayard+Rustin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Douglas McGregor, Revisited: Managing the Human Side of the Enterprise","description":"The words of Douglas McGregor, one of the fore-fathers of management theory and one of the top business thinkers of all time, cannot and should not be ignored. McGregor's vision of a more humanistic workplace may not have been widely accepted over three decades ago, but technological advancements that McGregor himself anticipated have paradoxically helped companies become more human. Viewing employees not as cogs in the machine but as living beings with individual goals-what McGregor called \\"the human side of the enterprise\\"-has proven to provide a remarkable competitive advantage. Now, with the rise of the networked economy, the growing power of frontline workers, and the shift in power from mass producer to individual consumer, authors Gary Heil, Warren Bennis, and Deborah Stephens assert that McGregor's ideas are more important and relevant than ever before. Douglas McGregor, Revisited emphasizes McGregor's lasting influence and updates his thinking with new concepts, fresh strategies, and modern implementation. This timely work traces McGregor's original thinking, which has emerged in current approaches that stress distributed leadership, open-minded appraisal techniques, and employee/customer commitment. Highlighted throughout with gems of wisdom in McGregor's own words, the book describes the value of his theories for today's managers. The authors carefully outline how to put McGregor's thinking into practice in your own business so you can: * Devise a better performance management system * Form and supervise effective management teams * Build cooperation instead of internal competition * Cultivate an intrinsically motivating, values-driven workplace * Create a cause worthy of employee commitment Also featured are examples from a host of companies and leaders who have flourished under McGregor's approach. Authoritative and highly instructive, Douglas McGregor, Revisited offers new generations of managers important lessons from history and from the field. Praise for Douglas McGregor, Revisited \\"This book revisits in a contemporary manner the most important question facing management today: given what we know about human nature, how should work be managed so as to unleash the vast creative potential of human beings? The evidence is overwhelming that many people either come to an organization or can be appropriately led to exhibit the behavior McGregor characterized as 'Theory Y.' This book provides a 'how-to' approach for developing people at work and for establishing high performance organizations.\\"-Joseph A. Maciariello, Horton Professor of Management Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management, Claremont Graduate University and Claremont McKenna College. Author of Lasting Value: Lessons from a Century of Agility at Lincoln Electric Douglas McGregor's seminal works, The Human Side of the Enterprise and The Professional Manager, debunked Taylorism and described a revolutionary way to manage people. He was the first to apply the findings in behavioral science to the world of business. Based on what had been learned about human behavior, McGregor explored the implications of managing people in a different manner than tradition dictated. The nature of work today makes McGregor's ideas more relevant than ever before. This important book applies his thinking to today's business world, proving again that the human aspect of work is crucial to organizational effectiveness. It also suggests how you can change your thinking and implement his ideas in your own business and workplace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h-xmCgAAQBAJ&dq=Douglas+McGregor,+Revisited:+Managing+the+Human+Side+of+the+Enterprise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Bank Fishing","description":"For anglers interested in catching more than trout and bass, who dont want to travel to at faraway places and buy expensive, specialized equipment, opportunities for coarse fishing abound.

By focusing on the social, religious and political tensions that helped define the course of Prussian history, the book also throws light on the development of modern German history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AGvJAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Citypack Boston (1st ed)","description":"Fodor's Citypack Barcelona 1st ed.These ingenious city guides package a concise full-color miniguide together with a full-size color map in a sturdy plastic sleeve.

His own was vulnerable.\\", Cartier-Bresson wrote about David Seymour, who liked to be called Chim. Chim is best known as one of the cofounders of photojournalism s famous cooperative Magnum Photos. Weaving Chim s life and work, this book discovers this empathetic photographer who has been called \\"The First Human Rights Photographer\\". In 1947, Chim was one of the four cofounders of the Magnum Photos cooperative with Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and George Rodger. He also wrote Magnum s 1955 bylaws, which are still in effect today. But he is the only one of those famous photographers who does not have a full biography to his name. This book examines his life and work from Poland to France to the Spanish Civil War, his work for British intelligence during World War II, his reportage on Europe s children after the war, his reportages on Italian actors, illiteracy and religious festivals in Southern Italy, his coverage of Israel s beginnings before his 1956 death during the Suez war.

It took seven years to interrogate them and sift the evidence, after which the greatest of the crusading orders was abolished, its enormous wealth sequestered, and its Grand Master burned at the stake. Who were the Knights Templar? How was it that these powerful and wealthy warriors found themselves vilified and accused of the most depraved crimes? To answer these questions and to unravel the mystery that has shrouded the Order ever since, Edward Burman, through contemporary sources, including transcripts made by Papal notaries, provide a detailed account of the sensational three-month trial in Paris in 1310, and reflects on the background to the myths surrounding the Order which led to their arrest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4M1INwAACAAJ&dq=Supremely+Abominable+Crimes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Pig (Picture Puffins)","description":"This second edition explores the use of play therapy with abused children as a way of helping them heal their distress and make sense of their experiences through expanding their own creativity in play.

First built in Europe and grandly imported to the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, the classic multiway boulevard has been in decline for many years, victim of a narrowly focused approach to street design that views unencumbered vehicular traffic flow as the highest priority. The American preoccupation with destination and speed has made multiway boulevards increasingly rare as artifacts of the urban landscape. This book reintroduces the boulevard, tree-lined and with separate realms for through traffic and for slow-paced vehicular-pedestrian movement, as an important and often crucial feature of both historic and contemporary cities. It presents more than fifty boulevards as varied as Avenue Montaigne, in Paris; C. G. Road, in Ahmedabad, India; and The Esplanade, in Chico, California celebrating their usefulness and beauty. It discusses their history and evolution, the misconceptions that led to their near-demise in the United States, and their potential as a modern street type. Based on wide research, The Boulevard Book examines the safety of these streets and offers design guidelines for professionals, scholars, and community decision makers. Extensive plans, cross sections, and perspective drawings permit visual comparisons. The book shows how multiway boulevards respond to many issues that are central to urban life, including livability, mobility, safety, interest, economic opportunity, mass transit, and open space.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BoFLR2RkOSUC&dq=The+Boulevard+Book:+History,+Evolution,+Design+of+Multiway+Boulevards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Julius","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JwZ_b4K0k1cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voluntary Simplicity: Toward a Way of Life That Is Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich (Revised edition)","description":" A manifesto for the only kind of future that promises sanity and the possibility of contentment.

Slavenzoon en wees Henry Shackleford is gedwongen te vluchten en wordt aan de vooravond van de Amerikaanse burgeroorlog opgenomen in het gezelschap van John Brown, een militant voorstander van de afschaffing van de slavernij. Henry wordt door de blanke Brown voor een meisje aangezien. Hoewel hij zich in eerste instantie schaamt, ziet hij al gauw de voordelen van zijn nieuwe identiteit en vrijheid. Het verhaal van Lieveheersvogel ontspint zich rondom deze twee onvergetelijke karakters tijdens een cruciaal moment in de Amerikaanse geschiedenis, waarin de afschaffing van de slavernij centraal staat.

Not childhood, not old age, but the decades of our forties and fifties, the period now generously known as middle age. It's both an occasion for regret and an opportunity for coming to terms, the moment when we come up against our limits and discover -- for better and worse -- who we are. My Life in the Middle Ages is a portrait of what that unnerving experience is like. A collection of unified essays about the pleasures and pathos that attend the threshold of old age, it charts an original course between reportage and confession. Drawn from the author's own life, from the testimony of parents, children, teachers, and friends, from the books he's read and the life that he chose -- and that chose him -- My Life in the Middle Ages is a comic, poignant memoir that's both personal and generational. Whether he is struggling with God (or trying to find out if he believes in one), celebrating the books he's loved and regretting those he'll never read, or leafing through the snapshots in his family album and marveling at the passage of time, James Atlas is always alert to the surprises of everyday life. He parses the fine points of success and failure among New York's \\"lower upper-middle class\\" (several of the chapters began as essays in The New Yorker) and expresses the largest themes: \\"I tried to remind myself that death was a part of life. I was here, then I wouldn't be here.\\" Atlas writes movingly about watching his parents age and his father die. In a wry and soul-searching piece, he recounts his perplexing quest for spiritual meaning after a secular lifetime, a quest that takes him to a private synagogue and a Buddhist meditation center. On the tennis court, he ruefully capitulates to his teenage son's blossoming athletic prowess, recalling a similar passing of the torch with his own father forty years earlier. At once pensive and funny, lighthearted and profound, My Life in the Middle Ages is a tale of survival, but also a meditation on how it feels to flourish -- how to live.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zpC2wAEACAAJ&dq=My+Life+in+the+Middle+Ages+:+A+Survivor%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghostbusters II","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RH5lAAAACAAJ&dq=Ghostbusters+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tripbuilder Venice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rZrdAAAACAAJ&dq=Tripbuilder+Venice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Irish Songbook: Words and Music to Twenty-Seven Classic Irish Songs (Little songbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ctsOeuI2aKMC&dq=A+Little+Irish+Songbook:+Words+and+Music+to+Twenty-Seven+Classic+Irish+Songs+(Little+songbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Month-By-Month Gardening in the Desert Southwest (Month-By-Month Gardening (Cool Springs Press))","description":"The Month-By-Month series is the perfect companion to take the guesswork out of gardening.

From the beginning, Christ's followers celebrated the cross as a symbol of their faith. It was honored in church worship, carved into rough tombstones, pressed onto loaves of bread and set out as a sign of sanctuary. The cross represented what Christians believed, who they hoped for and how they approached life. In this thoughtful book Judith Couchman takes up forty images of the cross from early Christianity. As we discover the meaning and significance of each of these uses, we learn a little more about the early church. More than that, she helps us focus on the meaning of the cross and the Savior's sacrifice. Ideal for Lenten devotional reading and appropriate for any season of the church calendar, this book includes original illustrations of each cross image. The Mystery of the Cross will enrich your understanding of Christian tradition and draw you into Christ's presence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x2EKt2ZfDWwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shirley Temple:American Princess","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=M625AAAACAAJ&dq=Shirley+Temple:American+Princess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forensic Casebook: The Science of Crime Scene Investigation","description":"Filled with intriguing true stories, and packed with black-and-white illustrations and photographs, The Forensic Casebook draws on interviews with police personnel and forensic scientists - including animal examiners, botanists, zoologists, firearms specialists, and autopsists - to uncover the vast and detailed under workings of criminal investigation.

(Garden Plants))","description":" Public Gardens Management: A Global Perspective  provides essential information about public gardens and what is involved in designing, managing, and maintaining one. Although suitable as a textbook, its audience will include anyone with direct or peripheral responsibility for administration or supervision of a complex organization that requires scientific knowledge as well as public relations and business acumen. It may also prove useful for homeowners, for there is no fundamental difference between growing plants in a public garden or a home garden, a fact reflected in the extensive reference citations. The topic is multidisciplinary and as old as the beginning of human civilization when the concept of mental and physical restoration was realized by early man while he/she was in a natural but well-ordered garden environment. Thus began the art of garden making. Many volumes have been written on every applicable subject discussed in this and similar publications. Indeed the voluminous literature on history, design, horticulture, and numerous related subjects is nothing short of overwhelming. Accordingly, anyone involved in management of public gardens, whether as a director or area supervisor, and irrespective of the type and size of such facility, would have to have familiarity with various aspects of garden organization and administration. However, despite the enormous number and diversity of such publications there are very few books that deal with the multiplicity of the topics in such a manner as to be practical in approach and cover most relevant and unified issues in a single book. These volumes provide the essential background information on plants, animals, management, maintenance, fundraising and finances, as well as history, art, design, education, and conservation. They also cover a host of interrelated subjects and responsible organization of such activities as creating a children s garden, horticultural therapy, conservatories, zoological gardens, and parks, hence, administration of multidimensional public gardens. Nearly 500 full color plates representing illustrations from gardens in more than 30 countries are provided to assist and guide students and other interested individuals with history and the fundamental issues of public garden management. The 15 chapters begin with the need for public gardens, types of public gardens, historical backgrounds, as well as design diversity. Numerous quotations are included from many garden lovers, landscape architects, philosophers, and others. The author s primary aim in writing this book was based on the confidence that a relevant reference, between the encyclopedic nature of some and the specific subject matter of others, could be used to provide fundamental information for management of public as well as private gardens. The boundary between botanical and zoological gardens and parks is no longer as distinct as it once was. In part it is because a garden is not a garden without plants and in part it has become apparent that for all practical intents and purposes all animals need plants for their survival. Visitors of zoological gardens expect to see more than just animals; zoos are landscaped grounds. Moreover, most communities find it financially difficult to simultaneously operate a botanical garden or an arboretum as well as a zoological garden and city parks. A number of public gardens are currently referred to as  botanical and zoological garden.  Population density and the public s desires and expectations, as well as financial requirements, are among the reasons for some major city parks, such as Golden Gate in San Francisco, Central Park in New York City, and Lincoln Park in Chicago which integrate botanical or zoological divisions as well as museums and recreational facilities. While this book attempts to provide basic principles involved in public garden management, it does not claim to be a substitute for broader familiarity","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x0fQAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Really Works : The 4+2 Formula for Sustained Business Success","description":"Based on a groundbreaking study, analysing data on 200 management practices gathered over a 10 year period.

The central content of the principle was that reactions occur readily when there is congruence between orbital symmetry characteristics of reactants and products, and only with difficulty when that congruence does not obtain or to put it more succinctly, orbital symmetry is conserved in concerted reaction. This principle is expected to endure, whatever the language in which it may be couched, or whatever greater precision may be developed in its application and extension. The book opens with a review of the elementary aspects of the molecular orbital theory of bonding. This is followed by separate chapters on correlation diagrams, the conservation of orbital symmetry, theory of electrocyclic reactions, theory of cycloadditions and cycloreversions, and theory of sigmatropic reactions. Subsequent chapters deal with group transfers and eliminations; secondary conformational effects in concerted cycloaddition reactions; and generalized selection rules for pericyclic reactions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tTsXBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MUSCULOSKELETAL INFECTIONS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oDNsAAAAMAAJ&dq=MUSCULOSKELETAL+INFECTIONS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity: A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science","description":"From the names of cruise lines and bookstores to an Australian ranch and a nudist camp outside of Atlanta, the word serendipity--that happy blend of wisdom and luck by which something is discovered not quite by accident--is today ubiquitous. This book traces the word's eventful history from its 1754 coinage into the twentieth century--chronicling along the way much of what we now call the natural and social sciences. The book charts where the term went, with whom it resided, and how it fared. We cross oceans and academic specialties and meet those people, both famous and now obscure, who have used and abused serendipity. We encounter a linguistic sage, walk down the illustrious halls of the Harvard Medical School, attend the (serendipitous) birth of penicillin, and meet someone who \\"manages serendipity\\" for the U.S. Navy. The story of serendipity is fascinating; that of The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity, equally so. Written in the 1950s by already-eminent sociologist Robert Merton and Elinor Barber, the book--though occasionally and most tantalizingly cited--was intentionally never published. This is all the more curious because it so remarkably anticipated subsequent battles over research and funding--many of which centered on the role of serendipity in science. Finally, shortly after his ninety-first birthday, following Barber's death and preceding his own by but a little, Merton agreed to expand and publish this major work. Beautifully written, the book is permeated by the prodigious intellectual curiosity and generosity that characterized Merton's influential On the Shoulders of Giants. Absolutely entertaining as the history of a word, the book is also tremendously important to all who value the miracle of intellectual discovery. It represents Merton's lifelong protest against that rhetoric of science that defines discovery as anything other than a messy blend of inspiration, perspiration, error, and happy chance--anything other than serendipity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ORJVDALLF0kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Witch.

While important titles, wealth, power, and possessions may represent a life that is successful in the eyes of others, pursuit of these achievements prompts us to seek more of the same again and again. However, it is only through a fundamental understanding of faith in God that we can discover His purpose for each of us in life, and can in turn pursue a meaningful existence and achieve lasting happiness. In his authentic and profound book The Spirit of Happiness, Dr. T. Byram Karasu explores the psychological barriers that prevent so many of us from allowing faith to become an integral part of our lives and from becoming truly serene and fulfilled human beings. We all experience many difficulties and conflicts in our daily lives, meeting challenges at work and in relationships, suffering through illness, losses, and failures, feeling anxious, depressed, or simply empty and purposeless. If we view such ordeals through the wisdom of the Holy Bible, which Dr. Karasu presents to us here as the ultimate self-help book, we can learn to understand and identify with God's Holy Purpose. Psycho-spiritual exercises, including meditations and affirmations based on God's word, are placed at the end of each chapter to help focus the reader's spiritual intention and lead the way to a more joyful and rewarding existence. Beautifully written and deeply moving, The Spirit of Happiness begins where most self-help books end.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pfx66e3CEOAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sneaking In (Sweet Valley University(R))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=q95kAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sneaking+In+(Sweet+Valley+University(R))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Middle Mind : Why Americans Don't Think for Themselves","description":"Acclaimed social critic Curtis White describes an all-encompassing and little-noticed force taking over our culture and our lives that he calls the Middle Mind: the current failure of the American imagination in the media, politics, education, art, technology, and religion.

The Middle Mind is pragmatic, plainspoken, populist, contemptuous of the Right's narrowness, and incredulous before the Left's convolutions.

By observing the daily life of its members, Essien-Udom demonstrates that the Nation of Islam served primarily as a means for poor urban blacks to attain a national identity, a sense of ethnic consciousness, and empowerment in a society that denied them these privileges. Black Nationalism continues to hold profound implications for our understanding of the appeal of Black Nationalism as an ideology and a political force. \\"An excellent standard treatment of black nationalist belief and practice in the 50's.\\" Michael Eric Dyson, New York Times Book Review \\"This is an absorbing exercise in first class reporting. . . . In the light of his scrupulous fairness, the book is another illustration of how the press prejudges a story.

Parcells would give him a life-defining break in 1990 by hiring him as an assistant on the New York Giants staff. For a Jersey guy who loved sports, this was a dream come true, especially when Weis won his first championship in his debut year in the NFL. He'd always wanted to be a sports announcer the next Marv Albert but he'd caught the coaching bug and was now in a position to learn from the best. And he did, following Parcells to the New England Patriots and then to the New York Jets. Under enormous pressure and exacting standards, Weis flourished and later became offensive coordinator. When Parcells stepped down as coach of the Jets, Weis joined his colleague and friend Bill Belichick, who was the newly named Patriots head coach. Together they would thrive, building a storied franchise, a rare modern-day dynasty that won three Super Bowls in four years. Through it all, Weis designed offensive schemes that would befuddle even the best defenses in the NFL, and he coached a number of players to greatness, including Pro Bowlers Ben Coates, Curtis Martin, and, of course, Tom Brady. The chance of a lifetime arrived in December of 2004: Weis was offered the opportunity to lead one of the most prestigious football schools in the country, Notre Dame home of coaching legends Knute Rockne, Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine, and Lou Holtz. And so began a new chapter in Weis's career. Weis took over a program in dire need of direction, and now he is in the process of building his own legacy with his unique vision. Off the field, Weis faced his other challenges. Seeking to improve his health and lose weight, he decided to get gastric bypass surgery. What he thought would be a routine procedure turned into a nightmare as he nearly bled to death, lapsed into a coma, and was read the last rites. It was a horrifying experience, yet he battled back in inspiring fashion and still demands nothing less of himself despite the long-lasting aftereffects. He has had his joys, too. Weis considers his wife, Maura, his best friend. They have two beautiful children: Charlie, his \\"best buddy,\\" and Hannah, who he and his wife consider their \\"guiding angel.\\" Hannah is developmentally delayed and has been the inspiration leading to the establishment of Hannah and Friends, a nonprofit foundation seeking to improve the quality of life for people with special needs. No Excuses is not only illuminating and insightful, it is an extraordinary look inside one of football's greatest minds who has helped shape today's game.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mmi6PgXpTMQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Matter of Perspective (Doctor and the Witch)","description":"A look at the folklore surrounding the legendary Pennsylvanian witch, and the facts behind them.

Save for the introduction of nuclear weapons, the Soviet victory over Germany was the most fateful development of World War II. Both wrought changes and raised problems that have constantly preoccupied the world in the more than twenty years since the war ended. The purpose of this volume is to investigate one aspect of the Soviet victory-how the war was won on the battlefield. The author sought, in following the march of the Soviet and German armies from Stalingrad to Berlin, to depict the war as it was and to describe the manner in which the Soviet Union emerged as the predominant military power in Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xAZwCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neuronal Mechanisms of Memory Formation: Concepts of Long-term Potentiation and Beyond","description":"An international group of scientists discuss the latest work on long-term potentiation (LTP), a model for encoding memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2yC-Y_mIPawC&dq=Neuronal+Mechanisms+of+Memory+Formation:+Concepts+of+Long-term+Potentiation+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freud and Jung: Years of friendship, years of loss","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LBn7-3LpU5UC&dq=Freud+and+Jung:+Years+of+friendship,+years+of+loss&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer House, Later","description":"the bestselling voice of the new Berlin","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=q7omAQAAIAAJ&dq=Summer+House,+Later&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anais Nin in Recital Diary Excerpts and Comments","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xPi0rQEACAAJ&dq=Anais+Nin+in+Recital+Diary+Excerpts+and+Comments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Home Companion: Collections","description":"Illustrates various ways to showcase rare books, souvenir tumblers, unusual clocks, original artwork, and other collectibles around the home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IgT-ty8eqS8C&dq=Mary+Engelbreit%27s+Home+Companion:+Collections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Are Not Alone: Words of Experience and Hope for the Journey Through Depression","description":"A uniquely compassionate book that provides information, companionship and hope for individuals and families coping with depression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WdENSIcApMEC&dq=You+Are+Not+Alone:+Words+of+Experience+and+Hope+for+the+Journey+Through+Depression&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Malay / Malay English Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WNIOAQAAIAAJ&dq=English+Malay+/+Malay+English+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Registry Little Black Book","description":"Windows 2000 Registry Little Black Book is a must-have guide for every Windows users and administrator.

Still convincingly female, though in no way dumb and girly, fortyish Juanita serves drinks to the colorful crew patronizing Herb's Cafe in South Fort Worth, worries herself sick over a hot-to-trot daughter proving too fond of drugs and the dealers who sell them, endures a hypochondriac mother whose whinings would justify murder, dates a fellow middle-ager whose connections with the oil industry are limited to dipstick duty at his filling station and, by the way, she also hopes to become a singer-songwriter in the real country tradition of Bob Wills and Willie Nelson. That Juanita is way too old to remain a kid with a crazy dream doesn't matter much to her. In between handing out longneck beers to customer-acquaintances battling hot flashes and deciding when boyfriend Slick is finally going to get lucky, Juanita keeps jotting down lyrics reflective of hard-won wisdom and setting them to music composed on her beloved Martin guitar. Too many of her early songwriting results are one-dimensional or derivative, but finally she hits on something both original and heartfelt: a tribute to her beloved home state, warts and all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CzANKCOUqzMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serenade to the big bird","description":"After completing a tour of duty (thirty-five missions) in B-17s, Bert Stiles transferred to a fighter squadron.

Young Lenny Sethi is kept out of school because she suffers from polio. She spends her days with Ayah, her beautiful nanny, visiting with the many admirers that Ayah draws. It is in the company of these working-class characters that Lenny learns about religious differences, religious intolerance, and the blossoming genocidal strife on the eve of Partition. As she matures, Lenny begins to identify the differences between the Hindus, Moslems, and Sikhs engaging in political arguments all around her. Lenny enjoys a happy, privileged life in Lahore, but the kidnapping of her beloved Ayah signals a dramatic change. Soon Lenny s world erupts in religious, ethnic, and racial violence. In this tale from  Pakistan s finest English-language novelist  (TheNew York Times Book Review), the profound upheaval that was the 1947 Partition of India is dramatically revealed through the story of one young girl, whose account of her experience proves by turns insightful, funny, and heartbreaking.  Lenny s honesty is compelling . . . She is alternately thrilled and frightened by the events she dutifully records, and so, in the end, is the reader.   Publishers Weekly  Much has been written about the holocaust that followed the Partition of India in 1947, but seldom has that story been told as touchingly, as convincingly, or as horrifyingly as it has been by novelist Bapsi Sidhwa.

This is in spite of the fact that the majority of prostate cancer patients die with metastatic lesions to the bone. Progress in understanding this most important aspect of prostate cancer has been hampered by the lack of suitable animal models and an inability to accurately quantify bone metastases and their responses to therapy. Over the past decade, scientists in Japan and the United States have steadily advanced our understanding of the cellular, molecular and immunologic biology of primary and disseminated prostate cancer. It is this body of new information, combined with advances in imaging techniques and prostate cancer tumor markers, that prompted the need for an in-depth assessment of bone metastasis of prostate cancer. Accordingly, on December 12, 1990, a group of basic and clinical investigators from Japan and the United States convened in Gotenba, Japan, to hold the first conference devoted solely to the basic biology and clinical aspects of bone metastases originating from prostate cancer. The cross-fertilization of ideas that was fostered through in-depth discussion of technological advances among various basic and clinical disciplines not only further advanced our understanding of prostate metastases to the bone, but suggested approaches for precise quantitative assessment of these lesions and their treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rgnrBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collins Dictionary For Writers And Editors","description":"Typography and Language in Everyday Life provides a detailed look at graphic as well as linguistic aspects of language and suggests there is much to be gained from collaboration between typographers and applied linguists.

Scott Fitzgerald, the brilliant author of The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night, was a man haunted by failure to live up to his own early successes. In 1937, desperate for money, nearly broken in spirit, he headed west for work as a Hollywood screenwriter and one last shot at staying sober There, living in Hollywood's legendary hotel, The Garden of Allah, Fitzgerald met the beautiful young gossip columnist Sheilah Graham, whose elaborate pose as a British aristocrat masked the true identity that haunted her all her life. Before her death in 1988, Graham bequeathed a Pandoras box of papers, diaries, notes, and correspondence to her son, acclaimed novelist Robert Westbrook with explicit instructions to write the full story of her life with Fitzgerald, which she herself could not tell. The result is Intimate Lies the dramatic tale of an unusual love affair the turbulent romance between a great author at the end of his life and a false young woman escaping her past, set against the glittering ferment of 1930s Hollywood. \\"I was prepared to suffer any ordeal rather than reveal the truth about myself,\\" Sheilah Graham wrote in 1958. Running from a childhood in the squalor of London's East End, desperate to hide her lack of education, Graham reinvented herself out of sheer imagination, spinning a web of daydreams and lies to those around her. But she was unable to conceal her true identity from Fitzgerald for long; he was fascinated by her mysterious past and quickly uncovered her secrets. Despite pressures of money and dwindling time, Fitzgerald set out to play Pygmalion, creating for Sheilah a fanciful \\"College of One.  Later he made her the heroine of his final novel, The Last Tycoon. Sheilah, in turn, instinctively understood Fitzgerald s demons and cared for him with a survivor's strength as he alternated between wildly spectacular drunken episodes and quiet, doomed gallantry. Together they sought refuge in Hollywood, among such friends as Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley John O'Hara, and Ogden Nash. With Intimate Lies, Robert Westbrook brings a personal perspective and a sure writer's hand to this mesmerizing memoir, an unforgettable love story of unrelenting power and interest. Praise for Intimate Lies  The mood should be two people free  He has an overwhelming urge toward the girl who promises to give life back to him . . . she is the heart of hope and freshness.  F. Scott Fitzgerald, notes for The Last Tycoon  I was prepared to suffer any ordeal rather than reveal the truth about myself I thought, he has chosen me, I want him to be proud of the woman he has chosen. He must never feel that his girl is in reality a grubby little waif who has gotten to him by a series of deceptions.

Carmaletta Williams and John Edgar Tidwell explain that scholars have neglected the vital role that correspondence between Carrie Hughes and her son Langston--Harlem Renaissance icon, renowned poet, playwright, fiction writer, autobiographer, and essayist--played in his work. The more than 120 heretofore unexamined letters presented here are a veritable treasure trove of insights into the relationship between mother Carrie and her renowned son Langston. Until now, a scholarly consensus had begun to emerge, accepting the idea of their lives and his art as simple and transparent. But as Williams and Tidwell argue, this correspondence is precisely where scholars should start in order to understand the underlying complexity in Carrie and Langston's relationship. By employing Family Systems Theory for the first time in Hughes scholarship, they demonstrate that it is an essential heuristic for analyzing the Hughes family and its influence on his work. The study takes the critical truism about Langston's reticence to reveal his inner self and shows how his responses to Carrie were usually not in return letters but, instead, in his created art. Thus My Dear Boy reveals the difficult negotiations between family and art that Langston engaged in as he attempted to sustain an elusive but enduring artistic reputation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6s_ZCgAAQBAJ&dq=Dear+Boy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hooked on Seafood (volume 1 )","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uGfvImmy9lUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ohio University","description":"\\"This collection of ghost stories and legends focuses on strange events that have occurred around Ohio University and Athens, Ohio.

More than 225 years have passed since Alexander Hamilton created one of the nation's first commercial banks. Over time, these institutions have changed hands, names, and locations, reflecting a wave of mergers, acquisitions, and other restructuring efforts that echo changes in American finance. Some names, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, will be familiar to readers. The origins of others, including Zions Bancorporation, founded by Brigham Young and owned by the Mormon Church until 1960, are surprising. Exploring why some banks failed and others thrived, this book wonders, in light of the 2008 financial crisis, whether recent consolidations have reached or even exceeded economically rational limits.

In understanding the true nature of what it means to be fully human, Feuerbach contends that we come face to face with the essenceof Christian theology: human beings investing ordinary concepts with divine meaning and significance. The true danger to humanity occurs when theology is given the force of dogma and doctrine. Losing sight of its anthropological underpinnings and dependence upon or emergence from human nature, it then acquires an existence separate from that of humankind. Feuerbach leaves nothing untouched: miracles, the Trinity, Creation, prayer, resurrection, immortality, faith and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ly0WQQAACAAJ&dq=THE+NEW+ESSENCE+OF+CHRISTIANITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life's Little Prayer Book : 365 Prayers For Every Occasion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Grj4ZwEACAAJ&dq=Life%27s+Little+Prayer+Book+:+365+Prayers+For+Every+Occasion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Life Principles for Every Woman: Refreshing Ways to Prioritize Your Life","description":"The ideal woman described in Proverbs 31 can be quite intimidating.

Ferguson was a training teacher for college graduates at a Japanese relocation center in California. Her husband set up a junior college and night school program. Their efforts were to help relieve the injustices done to fellow citizens. Kay Watson's husband fought in Burma while Kay worked at one of the sites of a secret government project known as the Manhattan Project; she later learned that she might have played a small part in the plan to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Mary L. Appling was a librarian in a California high school when she met Hugh Appling, a serviceman just returned from the war; together, they worked in Foreign Service for the United States for nearly thirty years, a direction affected by their actions during World War II. The recollections of these three women and 52 others are edited and presented by Pauline Parker, who also endured the war. Many women had life changing experiences during this turbulent time--Parker has gathered the personal stories of such women as Marines and government workers as well as single mothers whose husbands had gone off to fight.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bf4YYpM5EUwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calling in \\"The One\\": 7 Weeks to Attract the Love of Your Life","description":"The classic guide to finding love and creating life-altering miracles of happiness and fulfillment, now revised and updated with new insights, stories, teaching points, and transformational exercises.

The nature of the stimulation shapes the connections among neurons that create the neuronal networks necessary for thought and behavior. By changing the cultural environment, each generation shapes the brains of the next. By early adulthood, the neuroplasticity of the brain is greatly reduced, and this leads to a fundamental shift in the relationship between the individual and the environment: during the first part of life, the brain and mind shape themselves to the major recurring features of their environment; by early adulthood, the individual attempts to make the environment conform to the established internal structures of the brain and mind. In Brain and Culture, Bruce Wexler explores the social implications of the close and changing neurobiological relationship between the individual and the environment, with particular attention to the difficulties individuals face in adulthood when the environment changes beyond their ability to maintain the fit between existing internal structure and external reality. These difficulties are evident in bereavement, the meeting of different cultures, the experience of immigrants (in which children of immigrant families are more successful than their parents at the necessary internal transformations), and the phenomenon of interethnic violence. Integrating recent neurobiological research with major experimental findings in cognitive and developmental psychology with illuminating references to psychoanalysis, literature, anthropology, history, and politics Wexler presents a wealth of detail to support his arguments. The groundbreaking connections he makes allow for reconceptualization of the effect of cultural change on the brain and provide a new biological base from which to consider such social issues as \\"culture wars\\" and ethnic violence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rr9NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Brain+and+Culture:+Neurobiology,+Ideology,+and+Social+Change+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Roar of Silence: Healing Powers of Breath, Tone and Music (Quest Books)","description":"The therapeutic power of sound is inherent in everyone.

Sunstein, one of America's best known commentators on our legal system, offers a bold, new thesis about how the law should work in America, arguing that the courts best enable people to live together, despite their diversity, by resolving particular cases without taking sides in broader, more abstract conflicts. Professor Sunstein closely analyzes the way the law can mediate disputes in a diverse society, examining how the law works in practical terms, and showing that, to arrive at workable, practical solutions, judges must avoid broad, abstract reasoning. He states that judges purposely limit the scope of their decisions to avoid reopening large-scale controversies, calling such actions incompletely theorized agreements. In identifying them as the core feature of legal reasoning, he takes issue with advocates of comprehensive theories and systemization, from Robert Bork to Jeremy Bentham, and Ronald Dworkin. Equally important, Sunstein goes on to argue that it is the living practice of the nation's citizens that truly makes law. Legal reasoning can seem impenetrable, mysterious, baroque. Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict helps dissolve the mystery. Whether discussing abortion, homosexuality, or free speech, the meaning of the Constitution, or the spell cast by the Warren Court, Cass Sunstein writes with grace and power, offering a striking and original vision of the role of the law in a diverse society. In his flexible, practical approach to legal reasoning, he moves the debate over fundamental values and principles out of the courts and back to its rightful place in a democratic state: to the legislatures elected by the people. In this Second Edition, the author updates the previous edition bringing the book into the current mainstream of twenty-first century legal reasoning and judicial decision-making focusing on the many relevant contemporary issues and developments that occurred since its initial 1996 publication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s45HDwAAQBAJ&dq=Legal+Reasoning+and+Political+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darby's Rangers: We Led the Way","description":"The exciting true story of a legendary leader and the men who fought by his side in World War II, told in his own words From the moment they hit the beaches in North Africa to their last desperate struggle at Anzio, Darby s Rangers asked for only one thing in World War II the chance to fight.

Davis depicts the various ways different societies have responded to the intrinsic contradictions of slavery from antiquity to the early 1770's in order to establish the uniqueness of the abolitionists' response. While slavery has always caused considerable social and psychological tension, Western culture has associated it with certain religious and philosophical doctrines that gave it the highest sanction. The contradiction of slavery grew more profound when it became closely linked with American colonization, which had as its basic foundation the desire and opportunity to create a more perfect society. Davis provides a comparative analysis of slave systems in the Old World, a discussion of the early attitudes towards American slavery, and a detailed exploration of the early protests against Negro bondage, as well as the religious, literary, and philosophical developments that contributed to both sides in the controversies of the late eighteenth century. This exemplary introduction to the history of slavery in Western culture presents the traditions in thought and value that gave rise to the attitudes of both abolitionists and defenders of slavery in the late eighteenth century as well as the nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IyodFB4SdOIC&dq=The+Problem+of+Slavery+in+Western+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grace in a Tree Stump: Old Testament Stories of God's Love","description":"Corrects the misconception that the God of the Old Testament is one of wrath and judgment by discussing such topics as \\"Grace in the Morning,\\" \\"Gracious Commandments,\\" and \\"Grace and God's Love for the Future,\\" as found in the books of Genesis, Deuteronomy, and Ruth.

In addition, because children with special needs are now widely included in a majority of early childhood classrooms, they have completely rewritten a chapter to focus more broadly on observing behaviours that may be viewed as disquieting. Designed to help teachers better understand children's behaviour, the book outlines methods for recordkeeping that provide a realistic picture of each child's interactions and experiences in the classroom. Numerous examples of teachers' observations of children from birth to age 8 enrich this work and make it accessible, practical, and enjoyable to read. With over 130,000 copies in print, this valuable resource for pre- and inservice educators features: fresh information about how children think and learn, how their language develops, and how their families, their culture, and their environment influence and help to shape them; observations that reflect the increasingly diverse population in contemporary early childhood classrooms; and the imperative for teachers to widen their lens in order to meet the needs of young children with a range of developmental capacities, abilities, and behaviours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P83fCgAAQBAJ&dq=Guidance+of+Young+Children+(6th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are You EVER Going to be Thin? (and other stories)","description":"Raymond Carver called Anton Chekhov \\"the greatest short story writer who has ever lived.\\" This unequivocal verdict on Chekhov's genius has been echoed many times by writers as diverse as Katherine Mansfield, Somerset Maugham, John Cheever and Tobias Wolf. While his popularity as a playwright has sometimes overshadowed his achievements in prose, the importance of Chekhov's stories is now recognized by readers as well as by fellow authors. Their themes--alienation, the absurdity and tragedy of human existence--have as much relevance today as when they were written, and these superb new translations capture their modernist spirit. Elusive and subtle, spare and unadorned, the stories in this selection are among Chekhov's most poignant and lyrical. The book includes well-known pieces such as \\"The Lady with the Little Dog,\\" as well as less familiar work like \\"Gusev,\\" inspired by Chekhov's travels in the Far East, and \\"Rothschild's Violin,\\" a haunting and darkly humorous tale about death and loss.

The Mask of Sanity is distinguished by its central thesis that the psychopath exhibits normal function according to standard psychiatric criteria, yet privately engages in destructive behavior. The book was intended to assist with detection and diagnosis of the elusive psychopath for purposes of palliation and offered no cure for the condition itself. The idea of a master deceiver secretly possessed of no moral or ethical restraints, yet behaving in public with excellent function, electrified American society and led to heightened interest in both psychological introspection and the detection of hidden psychopaths in society at large, leading to a refinement of the word itself into what was perceived to be a less stigmatizing term,  sociopath .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=00aQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Mycology, 1e","description":"The first book of its kind to focus on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of patients with fungal infections, this definitive reference returns in a completely revised, full-color new edition.

To a Glaswegian like James, 1930s Yorkshire appears to offer an idyllic pocket of rural life in a rapidly changing world. But even life in the sleepy village of Darrowby has its challenges. On the one hand there are his new colleagues, Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, two brothers who attract a constant stream of local girls to whom James is strangely invisible.

In tense, searing prose, punctuated with the blackest of humor, Cooney documents the slow erosion of her mother's mind, of the powerful bond the two shared, and her own descent into drink and despair. \\"She was always my favorite person,\\" says Eleanor, \\"hip, cool, brilliant, funny, sane -- my ultimate confidante and sympathizer.\\" Now, overwhelmed by the Chinese water torture of endless small worries, endlessly repeated, that dementia thrusts on victim and caregiver, Cooney resorts to booze, tranquilizers, and gallows wit to blunt the edges of the relentless loss and the demands of ministering to this devastating disease. But the coping mechanism that finally serves this eloquent writer best is writing, the ability to bring to vivid life the memories her mother is losing. As her mother gropes in the gathering darkness for a grip on the world she once loved, succeeding only in conjuring sad fantasies of places and times with her dead husband, Cooney revisits their true past. Death in Slow Motion becomes the mesmerizing story of Eleanor's actual childhood, straight out of the pages of John Cheever; the daring and vibrant mother she remembers; and a time that no longer exists for either of them. Deeply moving, shockingly honest, and framed by wounded love, Cooney's tale reveals in remorseless prose the true nature of the beast called Alzheimer's, and with it, the arcane processes of the writer's craft and of a splendid mind's disintegration. \\"Alzheimer's,\\" Cooney writes, \\"you'll never be the same once it's paid you a visit.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bJupPwAACAAJ&dq=Death+in+Slow+Motion+:+My+Mother%27s+Descent+into+Alzheimer%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dynasties; Great Thoroughbred Stallions","description":"Examines how the modern American Thoroughbred has evolved primarily through the influence of 26 noteworthy stallions.

It illustrates the historical processes that produced borderlands in the Americas and connected them to global circuits of exchange and migration in the early modern world. The book offers a balanced state-of-the-art educational tool representing innovative research for teaching and scholarship. Its geographical scope encompasses imperial borderlands in what today is northern Mexico and southern United States; the greater Caribbean basin, including cross-imperial borderlands among the island archipelagos and Central America; the greater Paraguayan river basin, including the Gran Chaco, lowland Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia; the Amazonian borderlands; the grasslands and steppes of southern Argentina and Chile; and Iberian trade and religious networks connecting the Americas to Africa and Asia. The volume is structured around the following broad themes: environmental change and humanly crafted landscapes; the role of indigenous allies in the Spanish and Portuguese military expeditions; negotiations of power across imperial lines and indigenous chiefdoms; the parallel development of subsistence and commercial economies across terrestrial and maritime trade routes; labor and the corridors of forced and free migration that led to changing social and ethnic identities; histories of science and cartography; Christian missions, music, and visual arts; gender and sexuality, emphasizing distinct roles and experiences documented for men and women in the borderlands. While centered in the colonial era, it is framed by pre-contact Mesoamerican borderlands and nineteenth-century national developments for those regions where the continuity of inter-ethnic relations and economic networks between the colonial and national periods is particularly salient, like the central Andes, lowland Bolivia, central Brazil, and the Mapuche/Pehuenche captaincies in South America. All the contributors are highly recognized scholars, representing different disciplines and academic traditions in North America, Latin America and Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wiy7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Change the Game: One Athlete's Thoughts on Sports, Dreams, and Growing Up","description":"In this charmingly honest book, Detroit Piston Grant Hill shares the wisdom and values imparted to him by his parents and speaks his mind on a variety of topics, showing how anyone--especially young people--can \\"change the game\\", on and off the court.

Recognizing the importance of methodological diversity, these essays discuss understandings of children and childhood derived from depictions across a wide range of media and contexts. But rather than simply examine images in formal settings, the authors take into account the components of the images and the role of image-making in everyday life. The contributors provide a close study of the evolution of the figure of the child and shed light on the defining role children have played in the history of Canada and our assumptions about them. Rather than offer comprehensive historical coverage, this collection is a catalyst for further study through case studies that endorse innovative scholarship. This book will be of interest to scholars in art history, Canadian history, visual culture, Canadian studies, and the history of children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FRraAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Here's Your Sign","description":"Stupid people are everywhere! \\"Last summer,\\" says Bill Engvall, \\"I got a flat tire and pulled into a gas station lot.

Carol encourages you to identify the conditions in your outdoor space - for example, the shady corner of an urban garden mimics the conditions of woodland or a windswept roof terrace will replicate an exposed hillside - and to pick the plants that flourish in these conditions. In each of the six chapters there are case study gardens that Carol admires for the way their owners have worked with the natural habitat to glorious effect and each chapter ends with a directory of about 30 of Carol's favourite plants for that habitat. As ever, Carol's text is wise, informative and beautifully written while photography by award-winning Jonathan Buckley ensures that the book is also a visual treat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M8VWCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mega Brain Power: Transform Your Life With Mind Machines and Brain Nutrients","description":"This is the amazing follow up book after the original classic \\"Mega Brain\\" revolutionized the mind tech in USA and around the world.

Are faith and doubt irreconcilable? Does one's understanding of God affect the answers to these questions? Christian Kettler investigates these questions from a christological perspective, drawing implications from the Scottish theologian T. F. Torrance and his doctrine of \\"the vicarious humanity of Christ.\\" If we take the humanity of Christ seriously, should we not speak of the faith of Jesus as a vicarious faith, believing for us and in our place when it is difficult if not impossible to believe? How Christians know God (\\"Jesus Knows God for Us and in Our Place\\"), who God is (\\"Who is the God Whom Jesus Knows?\\"), and how to believe in God in a world of suffering and evil (\\"Providence, Evil, Suffering, and the God Who Believes\\") receive new insight in light of this christological exploration. Wendell Berry's poignant novel of a humble country barber, 'Jayber Crow,' adds an incarnational context to a discussion with important pastoral and existential dimensions. In the vicarious faith of Christ we are not left, as James Torrance cautions us, to be thrown back upon ourselves, but called to participate by the Spirit in the faith of Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SU77DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+God+Who+Believes:+Faith,+Doubt,+and+the+Vicarious+Humanity+of+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel According to Matthew (Six Volume Set)","description":"Prof. George Wesley Buchanan PhD., Litt.D., D.S.L.

And for decades, clinicians and educators have recognized the value of this power, using it to respectively heal in therapy and educate in the classroom. The Cinematic Mirror for Psychology and Life Coaching mines the illustrative value of cinema, offering therapists and life coaches access to ideas that can motivate and enlighten clients. Although many movie guides exist, this volume complements the available literature by adding positive psychology, mental health, and wellness perspectives to the clinical/educational/coaching mix. The serious intent to cull from cinema its underlying psychological value has motivated noted clinicians, life coaches, and cultural critics to offer science-based analysis and intervention strategies. Readers may add their own movie insights and professional expertise to this rich foundation. The volume covers international as well as domestic cinema in a variety of genres, providing a range of film choices relevant to clients  lives. Beyond this, it expands on universal concepts of strengths, capabilities, and coping methods. Chapters in The Cinematic Mirror: analyze how movies can create and relieve trauma, challenge Hollywood s portrayal of the American family, overview the use of movies to examine relationships in therapy, explore the acclaimed Up television cinema verite series as studies in personal growth and social change, reinterprets images of disability in terms of positive psychology, examines models, or the lack thereof, for the American adolescent rite of passage, traces the history of mental illness stereotypes in film.

Yet individual organisms can practice the phenomenon differently, and birds deploy unique patterns of movement over particular segments of time. Incorporating the latest research on bird migration, this concise, critical assessment offers contemporary readers a firm grasp of what defines an avian migrant, how the organism came to be, what is known about its behavior, and how we can resolve its enduring mysteries. John H. Rappole's sophisticated survey of field data clarifies key ecological, biological, physiological, navigational, and evolutionary concerns. He begins with the very first migrants, who traded a home environment of greater stability for one of greater seasonality, and uses the structure of the annual cycle to examine the difference between migratory birds and their resident counterparts. He ultimately connects these differences to evolutionary milestones that have shaped a migrant lifestyle through natural selection. Rather than catalogue and describe various aspects of bird migration, Rappole considers how the avian migrant fits within a larger ecological frame, enabling a richer understanding of the phenomenon and its critical role in sustaining a hospitable and productive environment. Rappole concludes with a focus on population biology and conservation across time periods, considering the link between bird migration and the spread of disease among birds and humans, and the effects of global warming on migrant breeding ranges, reaction norms, and macroecology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LQBbQsbRwDwC&dq=Bird+Studies+at+Old+Cape+May:+An+Ornithology+of+Coastal+New+Jersey+(2+Volumes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who am I?: A [Backwards] Bible Alphabet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CV3bHAAACAAJ&dq=Who+am+I%3F:+A+%5BBackwards%5D+Bible+Alphabet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I saw france fall will she rise again","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nl8JAQAAIAAJ&dq=I+saw+france+fall+will+she+rise+again&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Internet Information Server 4 Administrator's Guide","description":"Provides a blueprint for building a complete Web server and lays the groundwork for setting up a site (Bookseller Publications Buyer's Guide)","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eZngAAAAMAAJ&dq=Internet+Information+Server+4+Administrator%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spring Rain (Seaside Seasons #1)","description":"In this first book of the Seaside Seasons series, Leigh Spenser, a young teacher and the single mother of ten-year-old Billy, is thrown into conflict.

Working in a secretive organization known as Section T, a team of physicists, engineers, and everyday Joes and Janes took on a devilish challenge. To help the Allies knock airplanes out of the air, they created one of the world s first  smart weapons.  Against overwhelming odds and in a race against time, mustering every scrap of resource, ingenuity, and insight, the scientists of Section T would eventually save countless lives, rescue the city of London from the onslaught of a Nazi superweapon, and help bring about the Axis defeat. A holy grail sought after by Allied and Axis powers alike, their unlikely innovation ranks with the atomic bomb as one of the most revolutionary technologies of the Second World War. Until now, their tale was largely untold. For fans of Erik Larson and Ben Macintyre, set amidst the fog of espionage, dueling spies, and the dawn of an age when science would determine the fate of the world, 12 Seconds of Silence is a tribute to the extraordinary wartime mobilization of American science and the ultimate can-do story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yk-dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intercultural Communication: A Contextual Approach","description":"In the fully updated Seventh Edition of Intercultural Communication: A Contextual Approach, bestselling author James W.

This striking assertion is at the heart of Rebecca Solnit s new book, which weaves together biography, history, and fascinating insights into art and technology to create a boldly original portrait of America on the threshold of modernity. The story of Muybridge who in 1872 succeeded in capturing high-speed motion photographically becomes a lens for a larger story about the acceleration and industrialization of everyday life.

For Rodin created an entirely new form -- the detail considered as a finished work -- and in doing so exercised a lasting influence on his successors, who were affected equally profoundly by his emotional expressiveness, his power of characterization and the subtlety of his modelling. M. Champigneulle combines a searching reappraisal of Rodin's achievement with a revealing account of his personality and of his troubled personal life\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Etc2AQAAIAAJ&dq=Rodin+(World+of+Art)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to electromagnetic engineering (McGraw-Hill electrical and electronic engineering series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YQEjAAAAMAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+electromagnetic+engineering+(McGraw-Hill+electrical+and+electronic+engineering+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Contemporary Consultant Casebook: Educating Today's Consultants","description":"This book complements The handbook of Management Consulting: The Contemporary Consultant: Insights from Leading Experts, 1e but can also be studied separately.

Kahn (Makers of Contemporary Architecture Series)","description":"Vincent Scully has shaped not only how we view the evolution of architecture in the twentieth century but also the course of that evolution itself. Combining the modes of historian and critic in unique and compelling ways--with an audience that reaches from students and scholars to professional architects and ardent amateurs--Scully has profoundly influenced the way architecture is thought about and made. This extensively illustrated and elegantly designed volume distills Scully's incalculable contribution. Neil Levine, a former student of Scully's, selects twenty essays that reveal the breadth and depth of Scully's work from the 1950s through the 1990s. The pieces are included for their singular contribution to our understanding of modern architecture as well as their relative unavailability to current readers. Levine offers a perceptive overview of Scully's distinguished career and introduces each essay, skillfully setting the scholarly and cultural scene. The selections address almost all of modern architecture's major themes and together go a long way toward defining what constitutes the contemporary experience of architecture and urbanism. Each is characteristically Scully--provocative, yet precise in detail and observation, written with passionate clarity. They document Scully's seminal views on the relationship between the natural and the built environment and trace his progressively intense concern with the fabric of the street and of our communities. The essays also highlight Scully's engagement with the careers of so many of the twentieth century's most significant architects, from Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn to Robert Venturi. In the tradition of great intellectual biographies, this finely made book chronicles our most influential architectural historian and critic. It is a gift to architecture and its history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ou4jKeocIiQC&dq=Louis+I.+Kahn+(Makers+of+Contemporary+Architecture+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from Ovid","description":"When Michael Hofmann and James Lasdun's ground-breaking anthology After Ovid (also Faber) was published in 1995, Hughes's three contributions to the collective effort were nominated by most critics as outstanding.

In this hilarious and insightful coming-of-age novel, author April Sinclair introduces the charming Jean  Stevie  Stevenson, a young woman raised on Chicago s South Side during an era of irrevocable social upheaval. Curious and witty, bold but na?ve, Stevie grows up debating the qualities of good hair and dark skin. As the years pass, her family and neighborhood are changed by the times, from the War on Poverty to race riots and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., from  Black Is Beautiful  to Black Power. Against this remarkable backdrop, Stevie makes the sometimes harrowing, often comic, always enthralling transformation into a young adult socially aware, discovering her sexuality, and proud of her identity.  Whether she s dealing with a subject as monumental as the civil rights movement or as intimate as Stevie s first sexual encounters,  writes the Los Angeles Times,  Sinclair never fails to make you laugh and never sacrifices the narrative to make a point.  Winner of the Carl Sandburg Award from the Friends of the Chicago Public Library and named a best book of the year in young adult fiction by the American Library Association, Coffee Will Make You Black is an exquisite portrait of adolescence that will resonate with readers of all ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTAKCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Before Antietam: The Battle for South Mountain","description":"Civil War buffs and scholars quickly recognize the dates of September 16-18, 1862 as the period marking the bloodiest battle of the entire campaign--Antietam. But until now, the ten days prior to that event have remained in relative obscurity. In Before Antietem, John Michael Priest offers the first book-length, tactical exploration of the Maryland campaign and the Battles of South Mountain, describing the decisive events leading up to the famous battle and elevating them from mere footnote status to a matter of military record. Chronicling Robert E. Lee's turnabout from defensive maneuvres to full scale Confederate invasion into Maryland, Priest demonstrates how this tactical change brought about a series of engagements near Sharpsburg, Maryland that came to be known as \\"The Battle of South Mountain\\" in which the Federal and Confederate forces struggled fiercely over Union territory. It was here that George B. McClellan, the new Northern commander, led his Army of the Potomac to its first victory over Lee in a furious action that produced one of the war's few successful bayonet charges. Written from the perspective of the front line combatants (and civilian observers), the book recounts the Confederate invasion and the Federal pursuit into Sharpsburg that set the stage for Antietam. From September 5-15, a total of twenty-five skirmishes and three pitched battles were fought. Priest provides graphic descriptions of the terrible conditions surrounding these events and so thoroughly enters into the common soldier's viewpoint that military history quickly gives way to gritty realism. He vividly shows that, had Robert E. Lee not been bested at the gaps along South Mountain, there would have been no Antietam. Lee's decision to make a stand along Antietam Creek was a point of pride--he had never been \\"whipped\\" before and would not return to Virginia defeated. That decision was a fateful one, since the sparring and fighting drove him into an untenable position that became his downfall. Priest's revealing narrative establishes that, at this stage of the Civil War, the Federal cavalry was better equipped and just as well trained as the Confederate cavalry thereby settling a point of debate among historians. Scholars and Civil War buffs alike will applaud the efforts of John Michael Priest in bringing us the means to view those devastating encounters from a true military perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YQ5ZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Before+Antietam:+The+Battle+for+South+Mountain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jails, Institutions, and Death","description":"Davis Stiles is a man on a quest to fix his brain.

A chapter is devoted to how Golddiggers of 1933 (1933) and Stand Up and Cheer (1934) deal with the economic crises of the Depressions. Another addresses race issues by examining the prevalence of blackface minstrelsy in the 1930s and 1940s, looking at productions like Swing Time (1936) and Dixie (1943). Rock and roll culture, which started in the 1950s and threatened America with teenage sex and rebellion, is addressed through such hits as Girl Crazy (1943), Bye Bye Birdie (1963), and Grease (1978). The work also explores dance as a signifier of character, the geography of musicals (such as New York or \\"the South\\"), fantasy settings, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, and the musical biopic (mentioning biographies of such figures as Ziegfeld, Cohan, Rogers and Hart, Cole Porter, and Jerome Kern). A later chapter discusses intertextuality in such shows as Singin' in the Rain (1952), which refers to many earlier musicals; Kiss Me Kate (1953) which refers to Taming of the Shrew; and All That Jazz (1970) which refers to the life and work of Bob Fosse. The work concludes with an examination of the continuing popularity of the musical with such hits as Moulin Rouge (2001) and Chicago (2002).

Volume II, meanwhile, turns to the basics of Japanese syntax. The book is by no means only about grammar, however. Rather, it is designed to help learners consolidate their understanding of syntactical structure through lessons that focus on how to talk about topics relevant to daily life. In addition to serving learners continuing from Volume I, Volume II will benefit those who have already studied beginning Japanese to some extent but wish to brush up on syntax. Major Features of Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition will enable learners to progress smoothly through the equivalent of the latter half of a typical first-year Japanese course while gradually building speaking and listening skills. Learners approaching mid-beginner status often find themselves suddenly faced with syntax and vocabulary much more complex than what they have studied before. Such grammar and vocabulary do not appear as frequently in everyday conversation as those words and structures they have learned up to this point, necessitating that they spend ample time on review. Moreover, learners at this stage are expected to become familiar with verb tense and aspect, time expressions, conditional clauses, and other topics that require them to have a solid grasp of context and speaker intent if they are to fully understand the differences in meaning conveyed by each. Such points cannot be mastered by reading through grammatical explanations alone. In short, the mid-beginner level is a difficult one for many adult learners who, unlike students in school, have neither time nor opportunities to take repeated tests or to otherwise gauge their progress. Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition helps overcome the above obstacles through grammar and content topics carefully selected to be appropriate to learners at this level of Japanese proficiency. The book is designed so that by practicing talking about each topic, learners will gradually and effectively acquire sentence patterns and vocabulary related to that topic. Like Volume I, Volume II is organized into several large units, each covering topics grouped under a particular theme. In this way, the book enables learners to achieve a well-balanced understanding of grammar, sentence structure, and context. Themes and lesson objectives of the five units in Volume II are as follows. Unit 1: Souvenir Shopping Following up on Volume I, Unit 1 presents survival Japanese related to shopping, thus providing learners with a thorough review of simple clauses. The unit also goes beyond what was covered in Volume I by showing ways of asking someone s opinion while shopping, making comparisons between items, and describing an item s characteristics. The overall theme is \\"picking souvenirs,\\" a subject that should be relevant to learners both in Japan and abroad. The verbal skills and dialogue patterns studied here may be applied not only to shopping but also more broadly to any situation that involves choosing between options. Unit 2: Building Rapport with Colleagues This unit introduces the plain forms of verbs   a crucial component of Japanese compound sentences   along with several sentence-final elements that make use of these forms. Topics are selected from among those that typically come up when interacting with people from work. Covered are constructions for indicating interest in another s actions, inviting someone to do something outside of work, asking for help or offering advice, and otherwise interacting with people in ways that help build relationships of trust and understanding. Unit 3: Returning to Japan for Work This unit explains how to build sentences using temporal clauses, direct and indirect quotation, and attributive modifiers. Through talking about factual events in one s life history or in that of a particular neighborhood, learners will study how to relate an event in chronological sequence, compare the way something is now to how it was in the past, and describe facilities and other things around them. Unit 4: Planning a Vacation Along with sentences with clauses for stating reasons or reporting questions, this unit covers sentence-final elements used to express indefiniteness, for example wish or probability. Topics deal with verbal skills necessary for planning and carrying out activities in cooperation with others, including explaining reasons or circumstances, expressing probability, and indicating desire. The overall theme is that of planning and going on a trip to a unique place in Japan. Unit 5: Solving Problems The focus of this unit is on forming conditional clauses. Topics include preparing for earthquakes or other disasters, discussing dreams for the future, solving problems, helping someone who is lost, and other situations that call on learners to talk about what might happen in the future, discuss options for solving problems, and give instructions or explain steps for doing something.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vZ1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Japanese+for+Busy+People+II:+CDs+(Japanese+for+Busy+People+Series)+(Pt.2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AI!

In scattered pockets from the Carolinas to the frontier in Texas, these dissenters, or \\"brush men,\\" often died at the hands of their own neighbors as a result of their belief in the Union or an unwillingness to preserve the slaveholding Confederacy. Brush Men and Vigilantes: Civil War Dissent in Texas tells the story of how dissent, fear, and economics developed into mob violence in the Sulphur Forks river valley northeast of Dallas. Authors David Pickering and Judy Falls have combed through court records, newspapers, letters, and other primary sources and have collected extended-family lore to relate the details of how vigilantes captured and killed more than a dozen men. Betrayed by links to a well-known Union guerilla, many dissenters were captured, tried in mock courts, and hanged. Still others met their death by sniper fire or private execution. Their story begins before the Civil War, as they describe the particular social and economic conditions that gave rise to tension and violence during the war. Four more chapters follow, each detailing the horror and hysteria that characterized post-Civil War Texas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NLcWw2SPCoQC&dq=Brush+Men+and+Vigilantes:+Civil+War+Dissent+in+Texas+(Sam+Rayburn)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Card (Harper Monogram)","description":"Writer Sarah MacDonald finds unexpected romance with a younger man, Ian Wild, a legendary ballet dancer and movie star mourning the tragic death of his wife.

When Johnny s mother comes to Ben and begs him to defend her son, he has one secret reason for saying no. But while Ben turns down the case, his younger, beautiful partner, Christina McCall, does not. Traveling to Chicago and facing an explosion of controversy and deadly violence surrounding the trial, Christina steps into a case that is already nearly lost. Her client s only defense is his claim that he left his victim bludgeoned but alive.

In this classic study, a major philosopher and social theorist of the twentieth century offers a searching examination of the conditions under which individuals make choices that significantly alter the course of historical events and presents a scathing critique of various forms of social determinism that deny the individual freedom of action or a decisive role in history. The myth of the hero as the savior of the tribe or nation, as Hook notes, is older than written history. Until the ninteenth century, the hero functioned not merely as a cult figure but as a principle of historical explanation, a key to the rise and fall of countries and even of cultures. The exaggerations and omissions of this point of view produced an equally simplistic reaction with the formulation of determinist historiographies in which physical, racial, social, and economic forces replaced individuals as the dynamic factors in the development of events. Hook singles out orthodox Marxism as the most all-encompassing determinist system and subjects the historical thinking of Engels, Plekhanov, and Trotsky to sharp and meticulous scrutiny. Using the Russian Revolution as a test case, Hook observes that while the February 1917 Revolution was an inevitable development, the October revolution was, according to the best historical evidence, contingent upon the personality and actions of Lenin. In his 1978 reconsideration of the subject of heroism, appearing new to this edition, Hook defines a middle ground between the extremes of voluntarism and determinism that explains why the presence of strong personalities are decisive under certain conditions while under others key actors would appear to be almost interchangeable. He points us toward an understanding of a fascinating problem in history and raises essential questions about the role of \\"great\\" men and women in a democracy. \\"The Hero in History \\"will be of interest to intellectual historians, philosophers, political scientists, and sociologists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=odMYbk1NPtcC&dq=The+Hero+in+History:+A+Study+in+Limitation+and+Possibility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baseball by the Beach: A History of America's National Pastime on Cape Cod","description":"The definitive history of Cape Cod's summer baseball league, the most prestigious such league in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UqMBAAAACAAJ&dq=Baseball+by+the+Beach:+A+History+of+America%27s+National+Pastime+on+Cape+Cod&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"40 Bright & Bold Paper-Pieced Blocks: 12-Inch Designs","description":"John Bright was one of the greatest British statesmen of the nineteenth century. In a series of Punch cartoons in 1878, Bright featured alongside Disraeli and Gladstone as among the most influential politicians of the age. However, his profound contribution to British politics and society has been virtually forgotten in the modern world. Bright played a critical role in many of the most important political movements of the Victorian era, from the repeal of the Corn Laws to Home Rule. In his great campaign leading up to the Reform Act 1867, he fought for parliamentary reform on behalf of the working class and for the abolition of newspaper taxes. Internationally renowned as an orator, he was a dedicated opponent of slavery and champion of the North in the American Civil War. His testimonial for Abraham Lincoln's re-election was found in the President's pocket on his assassination. He was vigorously opposed to the Crimean War and campaigned against the oppression of the Irish tenantry and colonial subjects throughout the Empire. Fiercely independent, he eventually split from the Liberal Party over Home Rule, becoming a Liberal Unionist. In this new biography, the first for over 30 years, Bill Cash provides an incisive and engaging portrait of a man who influenced the politics of his generation more than virtually any other, with important implications for the present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=keeKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once Upon Macdonalds Farm","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VUGjzgEACAAJ&dq=Once+Upon+Macdonalds+Farm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Sketchbooks of Vincent Van Gogh","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WQbFQgAACAAJ&dq=Seven+Sketchbooks+of+Vincent+Van+Gogh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Professional Bondsman: How to Start and Operate Your Own Bail Bond Agency","description":"This new Second Edition is packed with information that is yet to be found anywhere.

From life as a poor unwed mother in London to becoming one of England s bestselling authors, Fay Weldon has crammed more than most into her years. Wife, lover, playwright, novelist, feminist, antifeminist, winer and diner Fay leads us through her peripatetic life with barely a role she can t illuminate. Born Franklin Birkinshaw in 1931, Fay spent most of her youth in New Zealand. With her glamorous father, a philandering doctor, generally absent, Fay s intrepid mother and bohemian grandmother raised her along with her sister, Jane. Brought up among women, Fay found men a mystery until the swinging sixties in London where she became a central figure in the literary scene. She scraped along penning winning advertising slogans before she began to write fiction. As this memoir comes to a close, we witness the stirring of her first novel. Riddled with Weldon s fierce opinions, as well as her  stinging wit, jaunty prose, memorable bon mots,  this frank and absorbing memoir is vintage Fay.

This diverse anthology addresses both historical research and interpretive methodologies, including investigating church and legal records, using social media, navigating sensitive or difficult topics, preserving historic places, engaging students and communities, and strengthening connections between local and national history. Case studies of exhibitions, tours, and school programs from around the country provide practical inspiration, including photographs of projects and examples of exhibit label text. Highlights include: Amanda Seymour discusses the prevalence of \\"false nostalgia\\" at the homes of the first five presidents and offers practical solutions to create a more inclusive, nuanced history. Dr. Bernard Powers reveals that African American church records are a rich but often overlooked source for developing a more complete portrayal of individuals and communities. Dr. David Young, executive director of Cliveden, uses his experience in reinterpreting this National Historic Landmark to identify four ways that people respond to a history that has been too often untold, ignored, or appropriated and how museums and historic sites can constructively respond. Dr. Matthew Pinsker explains that historic sites may be missing a huge opportunity in telling the story of freedom and emancipation by focusing on the underground railroad rather than its much bigger \\"upper-ground\\" counterpart. Martha Katz-Hyman tackles the challenges of interpreting the material culture of both enslaved and free African Americans in the years before the Civil War by discussing the furnishing of period rooms. Dr. Benjamin Filene describes three \\"micro-public history\\" projects that lead to new ways of understanding the past, handling source limitations, building partnerships, and reaching audiences. Andrea Jones shares her approach for engaging students through historical simulations based on the \\"Fight for Your Rights\\" school program at the Atlanta History Center. A exhibit on African American Vietnam War veterans at the Heinz History Center not only linked local and international events, but became an award-winning model of civic engagement. A collaboration between a university and museum that began as a local history project interpreting the Scottsboro Boys Trial as a website and brochure ended up changing Alabama law. A list of national organizations and an extensive bibliography on the interpretation of African American history provide convenient gateways to additional resources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lD3xBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+African-American+Experience+(American+Historic+Places)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fruits of Hawaii Description, Nutritive Value, and Recipes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XWkvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Fruits+of+Hawaii+Description,+Nutritive+Value,+and+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harper's Bible Dictionary","description":"More than 3,700 entries present information on the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zNUonwEACAAJ&dq=Harper%27s+Bible+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The first four Georges (British monarchy series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J_xOzQEACAAJ&dq=The+first+four+Georges+(British+monarchy+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Color Is My Kind: The Life of Eldrewey Stearns and the Integration of Houston","description":"No Color Is My Kind is an uncommon chronicle of identity, fate, and compassion as two men one Jewish and one African American set out to rediscover a life lost to manic depression and alcoholism. In 1984, Thomas Cole discovered Eldrewey Stearns in a Galveston psychiatric hospital. Stearns, a fifty-two-year-old black man, complained that although he felt very important, no one understood him. Over the course of the next decade, Cole and Stearns, in a tumultuous and often painful collaboration, recovered Stearns' life before his slide into madness as a young boy in Galveston and San Augustine and as a civil rights leader and lawyer who sparked Houston's desegregation movement between 1959 and 1963. While other southern cities rocked with violence, Houston integrated its public accommodations peacefully. In these pages appear figures such as Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., Leon Jaworski, and Dan Rather, all of whom along with Stearns maneuvered and conspired to integrate the city quickly and calmly. Weaving the tragic story of a charismatic and deeply troubled leader into the record of a major historic event, Cole also explores his emotionally charged collaboration with Stearns. Their poignant relationship sheds powerful and healing light on contemporary race relations in America, and especially on issues of power, authority, and mental illness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fhTlAgAAQBAJ&dq=No+Color+Is+My+Kind:+The+Life+of+Eldrewey+Stearns+and+the+Integration+of+Houston&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets/ Teachers Guide (Story House Teachers Guides)","description":"Ready-made activities to accompany the original book written by J.K.

He survived eleven months of intense fighting until May 1945, when the Allies achieved their hard-fought victory in Europe.

In this book, Peggy Kamuf explores why any properly philosophical critique of capital punishment in the West must confront the literary as that which exceeds the logical demands of philosophy. Jacques Derrida has written that  the modern history of the institution named literature in Europe over the last three or four centuries is contemporary with and indissociable from a contestation of the death penalty.  How, Kamuf asks, does literature contest the death penalty today, particularly in the United States where it remains the last of its kind in a Western nation that professes to be a democracy? What resources do fiction, narrative, and poetic language supply in the age of the remains of the death penalty? Following a lucid account of Derrida s approach to the death penalty, Kamuf pursues this question across several literary texts. In reading Orwell s story  A Hanging,  Kamuf explores the relation between literary narration and the role of the witness, concluding that such a witness needs the seal of literary language in order to account for the secret of the death penalty. The next chapter turns to the American scene with Robert Coover s 1977 novel The Public Burning, which restages the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as an outlandish public spectacle in Times Square. Because this fictional device reverses the drive toward secrecy that, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, put an end to public executions in the West, Kamuf reads the novel in a tension with the current tendency in the U.S. to shore up and protect remaining death penalty practices through increasingly pervasive secrecy measures. A reading of Norman Mailer s 1979 novel The Executioner s Song, shows the breakdown of any firm distinction between suicide and capital execution and explores the essential affinity between traditional narrative structure, which is plotted from the end, and the  plot  of a death penalty. Final readings of Kafka, Derrida, and Baudelaire consider the relation between literature and law, showing how performative literary language can  play the law.  A brief conclusion, titled  Postmortem,  reflects on the condition of literature as that which survives the death penalty. A major contribution to the field of law and society, this book makes the case for literature as a space for contesting the death penalty, a case that scholars and activists working across a range of traditions will need to confront.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=touUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Where the Sun Now Stands (Center Point Premier Western (Large Print))","description":"One of the most dramatic campaigns of the Indian wars was that of the Nez Perce.

Janice Kulyk Keefer was born in Canada, a country that for her immigrant family meant a land as free as the future itself. But she was also born into the history of her family's homeland, receiving both the gift and the burden of a past that often seems \\"an equal spill of beauty and blood.\\" Now she has set out to build a bridge of words between contemporary Canada and the ancient village of Staromischyna, once part of Poland, now in Ukraine. Honey and Ashes is novel-like in its sweep of personal and public history, and its ability to draw us into the complex mysteries of family. It moves from an extraordinary wealth of stories about life in Staromischyna and Depression-era Toronto, to an absorbing account of how the complex, troubled histories of Poland and Ukraine shadowed these stories, and it ends with a difficult journey back to the actual place where the stories began.

The area was selected because of availability of Federal land from the Kisatchie National Forest, access of about 3,400 square miles of land for maneuvers through cost-free agreements with private landowners, and open conditions that favored deployment of men and equipment for training purposes. Camp Claiborne became the largest of these installations. Although it was designed for about 30,000 troops, it was enlarged by another 20,000 by the addition of the Engineer Unit Training Center that was developed in West Camp Claiborne. Claiborne became the third largest city in Louisiana at the time. Many of the units which trained there became the most decorated during World War II and suffered heavy casualties in combat around the world.

The encounter is at Miami's morgue, where the unidentified stranger lies dead. His unusual old scars capture her curiosity-the dead man clearly had a tale to tell. This thief, who was accidentally electrocuted, may be the key that unlocks the long-sought secrets of a sensational cold murder mystery unsolved for more than fourteen years. Sunny and Ricky, teenagers on a Christmas Eve first date, were abducted, a shocking crime that was never solved despite a gigantic manhunt, a huge reward, and an outraged community. Frustrated police called the lack of leads eerie. Unnatural. Against all the laws of homicide and human nature. Now Britt wants the story, and she isn't the only one seeking answers. Sunny survived, the lone witness to that terrible night so long ago. But the reclusive Ice Maiden, now an artist and sculptor estranged from her wealthy family, is not talking and the killer's trail vanished long ago, like footprints in melting snow. Cold Case Squad Sargeant Craig Burch wants the killer. But as the Miami News reporter and the veteran homicide cop investigate the old outrage, they learn that sometimes the cost of justice is too high. When you start to turn over rocks, something ugly sometimes slithers out. Monstrous evil from the past emerges to overtake a whole new generation of innocent victims as deadly passions are reawakened and mortal fears resurface. For Burch, whose elite unit breathes new life into cold murder cases, the investigation strikes too close to home, reigniting his own private obsessions. And Britt, in the wake of national tragedy, is haunted, both awake and asleep, by the persistent ghost of a doomed, lost girl, perhaps a warning of a new tragedy to come. Britt meets the Ice Maiden, nearly freezes to death, and then the trail heats up as the sins of the fathers begin to strike down the innocent. A stone-cold killer out of her past is stalking the Ice Maiden again. Nothing is what it seems. And the inferno is yet to come.... Edna Buchanan, a born storyteller, combines her trademark wit, grit, and tension in The Ice Maiden, a narrative alive with Miami's blistering heat and high-octane atmosphere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nb-rfsHpXJsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mennonite Family in Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, 1789-1923","description":"Rempel combines his first-hand account of life in Russian Mennonite settlements during the landmark period of 1900-1920, with a rich portrait of six generations of his ancestral family from the foundation of the first colony in 1789.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jbgTv4teEqAC&dq=A+Mennonite+Family+in+Tsarist+Russia+and+the+Soviet+Union,+1789-1923&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violence and Psychopathy","description":"Adrian Raine Department of Psychology. University of Southern California. USA Jose Sanmartin Queen Sojia Center for the Study of Violence. Valencia. Spain The problems that psychopathic and violent offenders create for society are not restricted to North America. Instead, these offenders create havoc throughout the world, including Europe. In recognition of this fact, Queen Sophia of Spain has promoted a Center for the Study of Violence which recognizes both biological and social contributions to the cause of violence. In November 1999, the Queen Sofia Center for the Study of Violence held its IV International Meeting on the Biology and Sociology of Violence. This fourth Meeting, which was under the Honorary Presidency of H. M. The Queen of Spain, examined the biological, psychological and social aspects of the psychopath, the violent offender, and the serial killer. This book presents some of the key contributions made at that conference and which were first published in Spanish in 2000 by Ariel Press. A key thrust of this book, and a stance shared by all of its contributors, is the notion that violence and psychopathy simply cannot be understood solely, or even fundamentally, in terms of social and environmental forces and influences. Nor do biological factors offer an exclusive explanation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JBesBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragon Blade: The Book of the Rowan (Cycle of Oak, Yew, Ash, and Rowan)","description":"Hoping to settle down to a peaceful life with her family after the defeat of an evil force, Ashen Nordorn, Queen of the Land of Ever Snow, learns that the Mother Ice Dragon is once again threatening the world and can only be killed by a long-missing ancient sword.

Rune Larsson, ultra-distance runner Markus Torgeby was just 20 years old when he headed off into the remote Swedish forest to live as a recluse and dedicate himself to his one true passion: running. He lived in a tent in the wilderness, braving the harsh Swedish winters  for four years. This is his story. An international bestseller, this extraordinary book is a powerful exploration of running, resilience, loss, and self-discovery. A talented long-distance runner in his teens, Markus Torgeby excelled in training, but often failed inexplicably in competition. Pressurised by his coach and consumed by the suffering of his MS-afflicted mother, he chose to do something that most of us only dream of: escape the modern world.

Nickajack was inhabited by the Cherokees as early as 1730.

In his dramatic wartime career he sank ship after ship, sowing terror among Allied convoys and dismay in those charged with their protection. Kretschmer was a daring officer who favoured bringing his U-boat into the heart of the convoy and destroying it from within. He earned himself a tremendous reputation before his capture in March 1941, and The Golden Horseshoe makes it clear why. Terence Robertson s biography of the U-boat ace draws upon first-hand experience of conditions and the deadly game as the hunter sought to outfox the hunted. He paints a masterly portrait of life at sea and weaves in the fascinating story of Kretschmer and the exploits of his U-Boats. Kretschmer was eventually captured and interviewed by Captain McIntyre of HMS Walker, an episode which is also recounted in this book. Otto Kretschmer became a prisoner of war in March 1941 and spent most of the rest of the war in Bowmanville camp, Canada, before his release in 1947.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UbM2EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Golden+Horseshoe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sexuality and Authority in the Catholic Church","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7YimSwAACAAJ&dq=Sexuality+and+Authority+in+the+Catholic+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Basic (First Computer Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rbqLAAAACAAJ&dq=Simple+Basic+(First+Computer+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Hollow of Your Hand: Slave Lullabies","description":"A collection of lullabies orally transmitted by African-American slaves revealing their hardships and sorrows as well as soothing notes of well-being and belief in a better time to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x8bz7svjs6UC&dq=In+the+Hollow+of+Your+Hand:+Slave+Lullabies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garfield Says a Mouthful: His 21st Book","description":"He's a simple cat.

And a sniper takes a shot through an antique store window, wounding the proprietor.

Working in a secretive organization known as Section T, a team of physicists, engineers, and everyday Joes and Janes took on a devilish challenge. To help the Allies knock airplanes out of the air, they created one of the world s first  smart weapons.  Against overwhelming odds and in a race against time, mustering every scrap of resource, ingenuity, and insight, the scientists of Section T would eventually save countless lives, rescue the city of London from the onslaught of a Nazi superweapon, and help bring about the Axis defeat. A holy grail sought after by Allied and Axis powers alike, their unlikely innovation ranks with the atomic bomb as one of the most revolutionary technologies of the Second World War. Until now, their tale was largely untold. For fans of Erik Larson and Ben Macintyre, set amidst the fog of espionage, dueling spies, and the dawn of an age when science would determine the fate of the world, 12 Seconds of Silence is a tribute to the extraordinary wartime mobilization of American science and the ultimate can-do story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yk-dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through colonial doorways","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=56NpngEACAAJ&dq=Through+colonial+doorways&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HAUNTING OF TOBY JUGG","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eOp1QgAACAAJ&dq=THE+HAUNTING+OF+TOBY+JUGG&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I went to pit college","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k37WAAAAMAAJ&dq=I+went+to+pit+college&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DSL: A Wiley Tech Brief (Technology Briefs Series)","description":"Top-notch advice on adopting DSL DSL is exploding, with fifteen million fast Internet connections in 2001 and probably forty million more by 2003.

The author had had access to letters, diaries, uncollected and unpublished writings, and conducted numerous interviews in the Caribbean, North America, and Europe.

Volume II, meanwhile, turns to the basics of Japanese syntax. The book is by no means only about grammar, however. Rather, it is designed to help learners consolidate their understanding of syntactical structure through lessons that focus on how to talk about topics relevant to daily life. In addition to serving learners continuing from Volume I, Volume II will benefit those who have already studied beginning Japanese to some extent but wish to brush up on syntax. Major Features of Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition will enable learners to progress smoothly through the equivalent of the latter half of a typical first-year Japanese course while gradually building speaking and listening skills. Learners approaching mid-beginner status often find themselves suddenly faced with syntax and vocabulary much more complex than what they have studied before. Such grammar and vocabulary do not appear as frequently in everyday conversation as those words and structures they have learned up to this point, necessitating that they spend ample time on review. Moreover, learners at this stage are expected to become familiar with verb tense and aspect, time expressions, conditional clauses, and other topics that require them to have a solid grasp of context and speaker intent if they are to fully understand the differences in meaning conveyed by each. Such points cannot be mastered by reading through grammatical explanations alone. In short, the mid-beginner level is a difficult one for many adult learners who, unlike students in school, have neither time nor opportunities to take repeated tests or to otherwise gauge their progress. Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition helps overcome the above obstacles through grammar and content topics carefully selected to be appropriate to learners at this level of Japanese proficiency. The book is designed so that by practicing talking about each topic, learners will gradually and effectively acquire sentence patterns and vocabulary related to that topic. Like Volume I, Volume II is organized into several large units, each covering topics grouped under a particular theme. In this way, the book enables learners to achieve a well-balanced understanding of grammar, sentence structure, and context. Themes and lesson objectives of the five units in Volume II are as follows. Unit 1: Souvenir Shopping Following up on Volume I, Unit 1 presents survival Japanese related to shopping, thus providing learners with a thorough review of simple clauses. The unit also goes beyond what was covered in Volume I by showing ways of asking someone s opinion while shopping, making comparisons between items, and describing an item s characteristics. The overall theme is \\"picking souvenirs,\\" a subject that should be relevant to learners both in Japan and abroad. The verbal skills and dialogue patterns studied here may be applied not only to shopping but also more broadly to any situation that involves choosing between options. Unit 2: Building Rapport with Colleagues This unit introduces the plain forms of verbs   a crucial component of Japanese compound sentences   along with several sentence-final elements that make use of these forms. Topics are selected from among those that typically come up when interacting with people from work. Covered are constructions for indicating interest in another s actions, inviting someone to do something outside of work, asking for help or offering advice, and otherwise interacting with people in ways that help build relationships of trust and understanding. Unit 3: Returning to Japan for Work This unit explains how to build sentences using temporal clauses, direct and indirect quotation, and attributive modifiers. Through talking about factual events in one s life history or in that of a particular neighborhood, learners will study how to relate an event in chronological sequence, compare the way something is now to how it was in the past, and describe facilities and other things around them. Unit 4: Planning a Vacation Along with sentences with clauses for stating reasons or reporting questions, this unit covers sentence-final elements used to express indefiniteness, for example wish or probability. Topics deal with verbal skills necessary for planning and carrying out activities in cooperation with others, including explaining reasons or circumstances, expressing probability, and indicating desire. The overall theme is that of planning and going on a trip to a unique place in Japan. Unit 5: Solving Problems The focus of this unit is on forming conditional clauses. Topics include preparing for earthquakes or other disasters, discussing dreams for the future, solving problems, helping someone who is lost, and other situations that call on learners to talk about what might happen in the future, discuss options for solving problems, and give instructions or explain steps for doing something.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vZ1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Japanese+for+Busy+People+III:+CDs+(Japanese+for+Busy+People+Series)+(Pt.3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The great bustard and other people;: Containing: How to tell your friends from the apes and How to become extinct,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FTtLAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+great+bustard+and+other+people%3B:+Containing:+How+to+tell+your+friends+from+the+apes+and+How+to+become+extinct,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your First 100 Million","description":"Tim Flannery brengt in zijn baanbrekende boek Europa de geschiedenis van ons werelddeel in kaart en de krachten die het leven erop vormen  inclusief de moderne mens  en schildert daarmee een portret van een continent dat vandaag de dag nog steeds een enorme invloed op de wereld uitoefent.

Er is geen enkele connectie tussen de verdwijningen: ze vinden overal in West-Nederland plaats, de kinderen zijn tussen de acht en twaalf jaar oud en er wordt geen losgeld ge?ist.

English Bill came to the upper part of the river near Boggs in 1799 when that area was still a wilderness. Truth to tell, there aren't many more people living on Birch now than was the case, say, one hundred years ago.The title of this book reflects the geologic gift that makes West Virginia's Birch River unique: its large collection of rocks on an eight mile stretch in Nicholas and Braxton Counties. To celebrate this uniqueness, a number of rocks were \\"weighed,\\" and the largest topped the scales at two thousand and twenty five tons!River birches, with their crinkly and peeling bark, are found all along the stream, particularly on lower Birch where they form a canopy. It must have been that way two hundred and seven years ago when those eighteenth century surveyors gave the river its fitting name.J.M. Hutchinson, an early Nicholas County historian, wrote that \\"in the records of a survey of 100,000 acres made by Tabithia McKinley in 1794, they called the river Birch, and it has since gone by that name.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wQ8ezgEACAAJ&dq=River+on+the+Rocks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tax Sale Tactics","description":"Have you ever dreamed of buying a piece of property at a fraction of its worth.

'There are many problems here, and some very strange things happen late at night that I just can't explain.' \\"Poverty. Crime. Politics. Scandal. Revenge. . . . And a Ghost.These are the untold stories of the last days of a forgotten Chicago parish by the last person able to tell them: Fresh out of the seminary in 1956, Father Rocco Facchini was appointed to his first assignment, the parish of Saint Charles Borromeo on the city's Near West Side. Adapting to rectory life with an unorthodox, dispirited pastor and attending to the needs of the rough, impoverished neighborhood were challenges in themselves. Little did Rocco know that the rectory was being haunted by a bishop's ghost!Muldoon: A True Chicago Ghost Story dives into Father Rocco's four-year saga at Saint Charles, where his spiritual undertaking becomes a worldly adventure. His supporting cast includes a housekeeper inappropriately involved in her pastor's affairs, and a genius-priest who carries a gun, thwarts neighborhood crime, and teaches Rocco about \\"loving the poor.\\" And there's the pastor himself. He padlocks the refrigerator, guides young priests only in the weekly ritual of Bingo, and entangles Rocco in the dirty work of a fraudulent shrine.As a backdrop to this chaos, the rectory experiences a host of supernatural manifestations, and Rocco discovers the legend of Bishop Peter J. Muldoon. Are there clues in this story of early stardom and great achievement, clerical competition and revenge, accusations and scandal, a missing ring, excommunication, and possibly murder that explain why the unexplainable is happening all around him?Upon delving into the church history, clerical politics, local folklore, neighborhood sociology, and paranormal activity of Muldoon, you, like Rocco, may be left wondering: Has he been kept alive to tell the story of Muldoon, clear the man's name, and memorialize the bishop's beloved and forgotten parish of St. Charles?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JuS28j2oMmUC&dq=Muldoon,+a+True+Chicago+Ghost+Story:+Tales+of+a+Forgotten+Rectory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (New Portway Large Print Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pBMnAQAAIAAJ&dq=I+Know+Why+the+Caged+Bird+Sings+(New+Portway+Large+Print+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ambulance Ship","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PbHfAAAACAAJ&dq=Ambulance+Ship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living in Autumn While Preparing for Spring: The Journey Towards Marriage","description":"In a time before technology asserted its domination of society, two high school classmates have decided to make a go of it.

In Child-Loving, James Kincaid writes a fresh chapter in the history of the Victorian era. Dealing with one of the most intimate and troubling notions of the modern period - how the Victorians (and we, their descendants) - imagine children within the continuum of human sexuality, Kincaid's work compels us to consider just how we love the children we love. Throughout the nineteenth century, the child developed as a symbol of purity, innocence, asexuality - the angelic child perhaps not wholly real. Yet the child could also be a figure of fantasy, obsession, suppressed desires. Think of Lewis Carroll's Alice (or, a few years later, James Barrie's Peter Pan). The image of the child as both pure and strangely erotic is part of the mythology of Victorian culture. And so, Kincaid argues, the Victorians viewed children in ways that seem to us now complex and perhaps bizarre. But do we fare much better today? Contemporary society sees children at risk, in need of protection from pedophiles. Yet as our culture recoils from the horror of child molestation, we offer children's bodies as spectacle in the media and advertising, giving children the erotic attention we wish to deny. Built on a decade of research into literary, medical, cultural, and legal materials, Child-Loving traces for the first time the growth of our conceptions of the body, the child, and sexuality, and the stories we tell about them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TsNWPgAACAAJ&dq=Child-Loving:+The+Erotic+Child+and+Victorian+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CCNP Cisco Networking Academy Program: Multilayer Switching Companion Guide","description":"PLEASE PROVIDE COURSE INFORMATION PLEASE PROVIDE","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z5wKAAAACAAJ&dq=CCNP+Cisco+Networking+Academy+Program:+Multilayer+Switching+Companion+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost World of the Kalahari (Isis Series)","description":"An account of the author' s grueling, but ultimately successful, journey in 1957, through Africa' s remote, primitive Kalahari Desert, in search of the legendary Bushmen, the hunters who pray to the great hunters in the sky.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V5UmrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Lost+World+of+the+Kalahari+(Isis+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shooting Stars and Other Deadly Things","description":"Carrie and her homicide cop boyfriend Ted Brodsky's plans for a weekend together are derailed when a vicious murder puts Ted on the trail of an unusual killer, and when Carrie learns that the only eyewitness is her elderly neighbor, she begins her own protection program for the woman.

The True Story of a Man and a Nation Under Attack.","description":"A naval historian draws on newly revealed primary documents to shed light on the tragic errors that led to the devastating attack, Washington's role, and the man who took the fall for the Japanese tactical victory. Michael Gannon begins his authoritative account of the \\"impossible to forget\\" attack with the essential background story of Japan's imperialist mission and the United States' uncertain responses--especially two lost chances of delaying the inevitable attack until the military was prepared to defend Pearl Harbor. Gannon disproves two Pearl Harbor legends: first, that there was a conspiracy to withhold intelligence from the Pacific Commander in order to force a Pacific war, and second, that Admiral Kimmel was informed but failed to act. Instead, Gannon points to two critical factors ignored by others: that information about the attack gleaned from the \\"Magic\\" code intercepts was not sent to Admiral Kimmel, and that there was no possibility that Kimmel could have defended Pearl Harbor because the Japanese were militarily far superior to the American forces in December of 1941. Gannon has divided the story into three parts: the background, eyewitness accounts of the stunning Japanese tactical victory, and the aftermath, which focuses on the Commander, who was blamed for the biggest military disaster in American history. Pearl Harbor Betrayed sheds new light on a crucial and infamous moment in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AVboAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Possession","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aNIUAAAAIAAJ&dq=Possession&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle PL/SQL: Practical Solutions","description":"If you have mastered the fundamentals of the PL/SQL language and are now looking for an in-depth, practical guide to solving real problems with PL/SQL stored procedures, then this is the book for you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nVUIgbnr_ucC&dq=Mastering+Oracle+PL/SQL:+Practical+Solutions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Knight in Panther Skin","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OHEtjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Knight+in+Panther+Skin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Taylor Air Combat Paintings: Masterworks Collection","description":"From the B-17 Flying Fortress to the P-38 Lightning, artist Robert Taylor has dominated the air combat painting genre.

However it had been Richard Trevithick of England who was solely responsible for producing high-pressure steam through a smokestack. The initial setting takes place during 1829 near Liverpool at a historical site known as Rainhill. A competitive race was strategically won by the Rocket locomotive lucidly built by the aspiring George Stephenson and his ambitious son.During the earlier part of that nineteenth century internal improvements had played a major role in our country, and also for the coming of railroads. The monumental building of its Erie Canal in New York greatly contributed to these navigable rivers and steamboat vessels at this time. In fact there were many evident evolutions being rapidly unfolding for example air brake system, steel rails, electric telegraph as well as coal for supplying fuel. Dinning cars and sleeping cars were formally introduced by George Pullman and had certainly provided luxurious accommodations for the steam locomotive.Those public domain lands were vigorously brought to a more richer and prodigious development by its conglomerate railroads which had prudently expanded the acquisition of unfamiliar territories. An indispensable number of railroad charters were favorably issued by the State legislation in addition to land grants being actually permitted by the federal government. Moreover that quest of railroad achievement in the east was magnificently accomplished by the New York Central Railroad. Primarily the mighty and potent project of building a transcontinental railway across North America was successfully consummated as the Iron Horse became popular and evolved from its origin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OMG_mAEACAAJ&dq=The+Early+Steam+Locomotive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solomon Maimon: An autobiography","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UEYHAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Sigmar: Being the Epic Tale of the Warrior-God Sigmar, and the Founding of The Empire (Warhammer)","description":"The legend of Sigmar, warrior-god and central hero in the Warhammer fantasy mythology, is told for the first time in this book.

Richard Weisberg, who has written extensively on both literature and law, explores the role of legalism and its abuses in eight major novels of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Beginning with Dostoevski and moving by way of trenchant analyses of Flaubert and Camus, Weisberg culminates his argument in a brilliantly revisionist reading of Melville's Billy Budd. In each of the novels treated, Weisberg sees a verbally gifted central character relying on wordiness to avoid or distort previously revealed truths. He argues that the malaise Nietzsche called ressentiment goads these characters to verbalizations that do violence to others and, ironically, indict their very creators. He identifies the legalistic theme as the major mode of iconoclasm in modern fiction and the source of its holocaustic vision. Writers, he reflects, viewed with profound skepticism their culture's tendency to substitute complex narrative formalism for earlier, absolute approaches to justice. In this, Weisberg concludes, their works anticipated the jurisprudential discourse of today. \\"The Failure of the Word is a creative, provocative, and learned work, written with style and feeling. Weisberg brings to bear on his core themes (the legalistic proclivity and ressentiment) a wide body of knowledge and thought in law and philosophy, literary history and theory.\\"--Robert L.

First published in 1678 just a few years after the described incidents took place, The Buccaneers of America is also known by the title The Pirates of Panama. For its unabashed description of adventure and thievery on the high seas, the text has captivated audiences for centuries with its frank and reasonably accurate accounts of piracy in the waters of the Caribbean and Central America. The main focus of the book is Captain Henry Morgan, an English pirate whose skills at coastal raiding resulted in his gaining great fame and fortune. Rare for a pirate in that his raids were for the most part consistently successful and lucrative, Morgan would eventually retire and be granted the governorship of Jamaica by a British government grateful for work he performed for the Crown. This edition of the book is derived from a version of the text which first appeared in 1914. The text is generally faithful to Alexander Exquemelin's first-hand descriptions of his adventures, sailing with some of the most notorious pirates to ever venture upon the seas. Although divided into chapters, the book is written as a detailed but engaging log of the various escapades the pirates embarked upon, and is a text worthy of any enthusiast of piracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TpgtvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Buccaneers+of+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Washington: A biography","description":"AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AN NPR CONCIERGE BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR  In her form-shattering and myth-crushing book .Coe examines myths with mirth, and writes history with humor  [You Never Forget Your First] is an accessible look at a president who always finishes in the first ranks of our leaders.

But after he married Martha, everything changed. Washington became the kind of man who named his dog Sweetlips and hated to leave home. He took up arms against the British only when there was no other way, though he lost more battles than he won. After an unlikely victory in the Revolutionary War cast him as the nation's hero, he was desperate to retire, but the founders pressured him into the presidency--twice. When he retired years later, no one talked him out of it. He left the highest office heartbroken over the partisan nightmare his backstabbing cabinet had created. Back on his plantation, the man who fought for liberty must confront his greatest hypocrisy--what to do with the men, women, and children he owns--before he succumbs to death.

From Cape Cod to Connecticut, from Rhode island to Route 128, it explains how people survived the storm by spending more than 48 hours in their cars, and how coastal homes were torn from their foundations and smashed to smithereens by the vicious surf. The book records the brighter sides of the blizzard too, including neighborhood parties, cross-country skiing down abandoned highways, and the many ways that people pitched in to help total strangers. Intriguing analysis also compares the Blizzard of '78 with the Great Blizzard of 1888. This book will be cherished by anyone who survived the Blizzard of '78, as well as those spellbound by its legend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_g8XdTjaf2IC&dq=The+Blizzard+of+%2778&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forever In Your Embrace","description":"On a dark and dangerous road, a daring British adventurer saves the life of a countess of royal blood.

During 1985, R. M. W. Dixon one of the most insightful of linguists engaged in descriptive studies today lived in the village of Waitabu and studied the language spoken there. He found in Boumaa Fijian a wealth of striking features unknown in commonly studied languages and on the basis of his fieldwork prepared this grammar. Fijian is an agglutinating language, one in which words are formed by the profligate combining of morphemes. There are no case inflections, and tense and aspect as shown by independent clitics or words within a predicate complex. Most verbs come in both transitive and intransitive forms, and nouns can be build up regularly from verbal parts and verbs from nouns. The language is also marked by a highly developed pronoun system and by a vocabulary rich in areas of social significance. In the opening chapters, Dixon describes the Islands' political, social, and linguistic organization, outlines the main points of Fijian phonology, and presents an overview of the grammar. In succeeding chapters, he examines a number of grammatical topics in greater detail, including clause and phrase structure, verbal syntax, deictics, and anaphora. The volume also includes a full vocabulary of all forms treated in discussion and three of the fifteen texts recorded from monolingual village elders on which the grammar is based.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zCFhkgbYSJUC&dq=A+Grammar+of+Boumaa+Fijian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Hundred Yards: The NCO's Contribution to Warfare","description":"This is a first in American literature - the first \\"how-to\\" book for infantrymen.

It will appeal to women and men alike, which is unusual for a book that at first glance could be dismissed as-just a western. I have asked several people to read it, their response could be summed up by one womans statement, I dont read westerns, but this is about people, I loved it! It is not just a western, it is a character study of real people who love, hate, forgive, get it all, lose it all, and regret that they have passed over a relationship for one that promised security, only to have security ripped from them and have to start over as shop worn goods. It is an example that the foulest of men can cloak vileness in the most appealing and respected of pretenses, and God can change that man, and make him finally, what he pretended to be. Ida Danced At His Hanging would appeal to the Christian audience, but also to the same extensive audience Lonesome Dove captured. Ida Danced at His Hanging summery: A shirttail outfit made up of men and boys, who each have compelling reasons for leaving Texas, have built a small ranch near Kalispell, in western Montana. Asked if he wants to go along with a posse, Ron Neil casually answers, Why not? Small things like that change lives. The friend who asked him is shot protecting him, and Ron kills three men. Life has made Ron Neil the kind of man a friend once described this way, Ron, what ever youve been given to do, its got donemaybe not always right, but it got done. The county sheriff, Lon Daton, takes Ron on as a deputy. Marith Campbell, the girl Ron has tried to court, becomes engaged Christmas eve, his first night on duty. With his mind preoccupied about losing her, Ron is shot in the neck. It takes several months for him to regain the use of his limbs. When he does, he has changed from a man who never believed in God, because his Daddy didntalthough that was the only thing they agreed onto a man who not only believes in God, he believes in a personal God who died in his place-- Jesus Christ. When this kind of a man confronts a man of wealth, position, and pseudo Christianity-- hes a deacon-- who uses his religious pretensions to hide his more deadly practices, what do you think will happen?

[an] exquisite retelling of The Tempest  (Kirkus Reviews, starred review). When Peter Gardner s ruthless medical genius leads him to experiment on his unwitting patients often at the expense of their lives he flees England, seeking an environ where his experiments might continue without scrutiny. He arrives with his three-year-old-daughter, Virginia, in Chacachacare, an isolated island off the coast of Trinidad, in the early 1960s. Gardner considers the locals to be nothing more than savages. He assumes ownership of the home of a servant boy named Carlos, seeing in him a suitable subject for his amoral medical work. Nonetheless, he educates the boy alongside Virginia. As Virginia and Carlos come of age together, they form a covert relationship that violates the outdated mores of colonial rule. When Gardner unveils the pair s relationship and accuses Carlos of a monstrous act, the investigation into the truth is left up to a curt, stonehearted British inspector, whose inquiries bring to light a horrendous secret. At turns epic and intimate, Prospero's Daughter, from American Book Award winner Elizabeth Nunez, uses Shakespeare s play as a template to address questions of race, class, and power, in the story of an unlikely bond between a boy and a girl of disparate backgrounds on a verdant Caribbean island during the height of tensions between the native population and British colonists.

Lisa Walker examines this issue with a focus on the questions of what it means to look like a lesbian, and what it means to be a lesbian but not to look like one. She analyzes the historical production of the lesbian body as marked, and studies how lesbians have used the frequent analogy between racial difference and sexual orientation to craft, emphasize, or deny physical difference. In particular, she explores the implications of a predominantly visible model of sexual identity for the feminine lesbian, who is both marked and unmarked, desired and disavowed. Walker's textual analysis cuts across a variety of genres, including modernist fiction such as The Well of Loneliness and Wide Sargasso Sea, pulp fiction of the Harlem Renaissance, the 1950s and the 1960s, post-modern literature as Michelle Cliff's Abeng, and queer theory. In the book's final chapter, \\"How to Recognize a Lesbian,\\" Walker argues that strategies of visibility are at times deconstructed, at times reinscribed within contemporary lesbian-feminist theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d7YUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Looking+Like+What+You+Are:+Sexual+Style,+Race,+and+Lesbian+Identity+(Cutting+Edge:+Lesbian+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daemonifuge: Heretic Saint (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","description":"A young warrior woman with a deadly psychic talent must come to terms with her newfound powers and determine whether they are a gift from the God-Emperor of Mankind or a curse from the Dark Powers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AKAtAAAACAAJ&dq=Daemonifuge:+Heretic+Saint+(Warhammer+40,000+Novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amish Wall Quilts: 15 Brilliant and Beautiful Quilts (That Patchwork Place)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0-0KAAAACAAJ&dq=Amish+Wall+Quilts:+15+Brilliant+and+Beautiful+Quilts+(That+Patchwork+Place)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Christ: Language in the Age of the Gospels","description":"The Gospel of Luke has long been known for its variation between good, educated Greek and Semitic influences.

F. Benson about Emmeline \\"Lucia\\" Lucas and Elizabeth Mapp. The novels feature humorous incidents in the lives of (mainly) upper-middle-class British people in the 1920s and 1930s, vying for social prestige and one-upmanship in an atmosphere of extreme cultural snobbery. Several of them are set in the small seaside town of Tilling, closely based on Rye, East Sussex, where Benson lived for a number of years and served as mayor. Contents: Queen Lucia Miss Mapp Lucia in London Mapp and Lucia Lucia's Progress or The Worshipful Lucia Trouble for Lucia The Male Impersonator Desirable Residences Edward Frederic Benson (1867-1940) was an English novelist, biographer, memoirist, archaeologist and short story writer, known professionally as E.F. Benson. He started his novel writing career in 1893 with the fashionably controversial Dodo, which was an instant success, and followed it with a variety of satire and romantic and supernatural melodrama. He repeated the success of Dodo, with sequels to this novel, but the greatest success came relatively late in his career with The Mapp and Lucia series consisting of six novels and two short stories. Benson was also known as a writer of atmospheric, oblique, and at times humorous or satirical ghost stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iVFODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pennsylvania in the War With Mexico","description":"A history of the 1st and 2nd Pennsylvania Regiments who volunteered to go to Mexico to fight the war 1846-1848.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=krEMAAAAYAAJ&dq=Pennsylvania+in+the+War+With+Mexico&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"M-Commerce: Technologies, Services, and Business Models","description":"The first complete introduction to the technology and business issues surrounding m-commerce With the number of mobile phone users fast approaching the one billion mark, it is clear that mobile e-commerce (a.k.a. \\"m-commerce\\") is the next business frontier.

OR A COLD-BLOODED KILLER? For their wedding portrait, petite Pat Taylor and handsome Tom Allanson posed as Rhett and Scarlett. Both came from fine Southern families, and dreamed of the Tara-like plantation where they would grow roses, raise horses, and move in the genteel circles of Atlanta society. Less than two months later, their dream exploded in terror and murder: their beautiful home mysteriously burned to the ground and Tom was convicted of the brutal slaying of his mother and father. Pat's only brother had died in a puzzling suicide, her grandparents-in-law were poisoned with arsenic, and no one -- from her wealthy employers to her own children -- was safe when Pat Allanson didn't get her way. It took Georgia lawmen more than two decades to stop her for good -- if indeed they have. In this fascinating account, Ann Rule delivers a tour de force: a whirlwind of misguided love, denial, guilt, and passions out of control; a series of brilliantly manipulated crimes; the bizarre and horrifying tale of two families brought to ruin; and, at the center of it all, the heartless, supremely selfish sociopath whose evil hid behind soft words and gentle manners, but who destroyed -- without mercy -- those who loved her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gMJXkBzZnKUC&dq=All+She+Ever+Wanted&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulling Faces, Making Noises: A Life on Stage, Screen & Radio","description":"Exploring the enduring popularity of Victor Hugo s Les Mis rables, this collection offers analysis of both the novel itself and its adaptations.

Primary documents, biographical material and thematic chapters bring this unique period to life. Eleanor of Aquitaine lived in a remarkable age. The 12th century saw significant advances in both the intellectual and emotional spheres. Scholars explored new areas of philosophy and science and also began to reflect on relationships and what it meant to be human and an individual. For the troubadours and the writers of the new romances, who composed in vernacular language, the focus of their works was the expression of personal feelings and the image of the feminine. Women had had more significant parts to play in the first millennium than in the second, because with the militarization of Europe and the emergence of universities, from which women were excluded, they lost much of their influence. This created an imbalance in society and it is within this context that Eleanor's life should be reviewed. The period is sometimes called the Twelfth Century Awakening due to the outpouring of extraordinary intellectual inquiry and discovery. Cathedral schools and universities, Islamic influence on European thought, the classical revival, vernacular literature, and Gothic architecture all exerted powerful pulls on the era's culture and politics. Accounts of Eleanor of Aquitaine's life provides a rare glimpse into women's lives during the medieval period, and though an admittedly extraordinary figure, we are able to draw some general conclusions about marriage and motherhood. Troubadours and courtly love, which revolved around declarations of service, devotion, and passion, and an emerging sense of the self. Thematic chapters hit the major topics, laying them out in clear and easy-to-follow writing. Nineteen biographical sketches bring to life the topics, and 15 primary documents, including songs, letters, and poems provide a close-up glimpse of how the people of the time saw their own world. Genealogical tables, maps, chronology, and a timeline provide useful and information quickly. The book concludes with an annotated bibliography and an index.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kDLx1-vH2voC&dq=Eleanor+of+Aquitaine,+Courtly+Love,+and+the+Troubadours&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biogas Plants","description":"The book guides specialists and non-specialists from around the world on how or whether anaerobic processes can be part of solutions for the management of municipal and industrial solid, semi-solid, and liquid residues.

Since 1950, ROTC has produced nearly two out of three American active duty officers, yet there has been no comprehensive scholarly look at civilian officer education programs in nearly forty years. While most modern military systems educate and train junior officers at insular academies like West Point, only the United States has relied heavily on the active cooperation of its civilian colleges. Michael Neiberg argues that the creation of officer education programs on civilian campuses emanates from a traditional American belief (which he traces to the colonial period) in the active participation of civilians in military affairs. Although this ideology changed shape through the twentieth century, it never disappeared. During the Cold War military buildup, ROTC came to fill two roles: it provided the military with large numbers of well-educated officers, and it provided the nation with a military comprised of citizen-soldiers. Even during the Vietnam era, officers, university administrators, and most students understood ROTC's dual role. The Vietnam War thus led to reform, not abandonment, of ROTC. Mining diverse sources, including military and university archives, Making Citizen-Soldiers provides an in-depth look at an important, but often overlooked, connection between the civilian and military spheres.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nhHxJbJlHIkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Odd Day","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UprPLnWBDqYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America","description":"Distinguishes various secondary mass media publications as performing on the same level as their well-known counterparts, and comments on their ability to effectively fight for change in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O6mrAgAAQBAJ&dq=Voices+of+Revolution:+The+Dissident+Press+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stranger on the Road","description":"*Now with links to video content online! It's been called \\"the most misunderstood book in history.\\" Wars have been fought in its name, scandals have been precipitated by it, politics shaped and reshaped at its word. Theologians have both defended and reviled it. Skeptics have done the same. If you are a typical member of the human race, you have often been perplexed by all the \\"fuss\\" surrounding the Bible. The question remains, \\"What does it really say?\\" Here is a book that explains the greatest of Bible themes clearly and logically. Rather than focusing on one part-and missing the whole-the author chronologically binds together the entire text into one great universal drama, looking at events from the perspective of those who experienced history in the making. The results are sometimes comical, sometimes frightening-but always true to the intent of the text. When you are done reading it, you may find yourself believing \\"the Book\\" like you never have before. Or you may decide not to. The author's objective approach leaves that decision up to you. \\"Even though I had attended church for over 30 years, the Bible never made sense to me. It was just a bunch of disjointed stories.

Through the eyes of Kabbalah, we are taken on a journey that reveals answers hidden from us for centuries. How did a small group of rabbis manipulate and distort the teachings of the Torah and Talmud in order to impose their monolithic views of Judaism on the Jewish peoples? The role of women is explored to show the drastic changes in their status under the rabbis after the destruction of the Temple. The roles of the male and female energies, from Adam and Eve to the present, are viewed from the perspectives of both biblical and rabbinic interpretation. Through the use of Kabbalah, gematria, and twentieth century scientific discoveries, the hidden meanings woven into the simple biblical verses are reevaluated in a more sensible context. Through these ancient texts we find a greater confluence between science and the Bible. Once thought to be in direct conflict to each other, through the wisdom of Kabbalah we find that there is much knowledge contained within each of them and that they should be viewed as parts of a unified whole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gk2ZNwAACAAJ&dq=From+Darkness+to+the+Light:+A+Personal+Journey+Through+Kabbalah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential ASL: The Fun, Fast, and Simple Way to Learn American Sign Language","description":"Includes over seven hundred of the most frequently used signs in American sign language, as well as signs for fifty common phrases","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BunndNSXrEwC&dq=Essential+ASL:+The+Fun,+Fast,+and+Simple+Way+to+Learn+American+Sign+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart Sense: Unlocking Your Highest Purpose and Deepest Desires","description":"Heart Sense is a compelling combination of research and \\"stranger than fiction\\" true stories illustrating that most people need to get out of their heads and back into their hearts.

They fell in love, married, and soon they were raising three children from his first marriage, and later, two more of their own. Christina knew right away that there was something special about the way Ryan was parenting his kids, although she had to admit their obsession with surviving end-of-world scenarios and their ability to do everything from archery to motorcycle riding initially gave her pause. More than that, Ryan's kids were much more security savvy than most adults she knew. She soon realized he was using his CIA training and field experience in his day-to-day child-rearing. And why shouldn't he? The CIA trains its employees to be equipped to deal with just about anything. Shouldn't parents strive to do the same for their kids? As Christina grew into her new role as a stepmom and later gave birth to their two children, she got on board with Ryan's unique parenting style--and even helped shape it using her own experiences at the CIA. Told through honest and relatable parenting anecdotes, Christina shares their distinctive approach to raising confident, security-conscious, resilient children, giving practical takeaways rooted in CIA tradecraft along the way. License to Parent aims to provide parents with the tools necessary to raise savvier, well-rounded kids who have the skills necessary to navigate through life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PBf-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard I, (Makers of history)","description":"Richard I (8 September 1157 6 April 1199) was King of England from 6 July 1189 until his death. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, Lord of Ireland, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Nantes, and Overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was known as C ur de Lion, or Richard the Lionheart, even before his accession, because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior. The Saracens called him Melek-Ric or Malek al-Inkitar - King of England.By age 16, Richard was commanding his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father, King Henry II. Richard was a central Christian commander during the Third Crusade, effectively leading the campaign after the departure of Philip Augustus and scoring considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, but was unable to reconquer Jerusalem.Although only speaking French and spending very little time in England (he lived in his Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France, preferring to use his kingdom as a source of revenue to support his armies), he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects. He remains one of the very few Kings of England remembered by his epithet, rather than regnal number, and is an enduring, iconic figure in England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iQ9HYgEACAAJ&dq=Richard+I,+(Makers+of+history)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Faith Is Your Fortune","description":"Welcome to Nikola Tesla's autobiography My Inventions.

Murphy's purpose in this book is not to shock but rather to educate, provoke discussion, and engender change. Looking at the sexual metaphors that are so pervasive in American culture jock, tool, shooting blanks, gang bang, and others even more explicit he argues that men are trapped and damaged by language that constantly intertwines sexuality and friendship with images of war, machinery, sports, and work. These metaphors men live by, Murphy contends, reinforce the view that relationships are tactical encounters that must be won, because the alternative is the loss of manhood. The macho language with which men cover their fear of weakness is a way of bonding with other men. The implicit or explicit attacks on women and gay men that underlie this language translate, in their most extreme forms, into actual violence. Murphy also believes, however, that awareness of these metaphorical power plays is the basis for behavioral change: \\"How we talk about ourselves as men can alter the way we live as men.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bMwDCHI3QbMC&dq=Studs,+Tools,+and+the+Family+Jewels:+Metaphors+Men+Live+By&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bypassing bypass: The new technique of chelation therapy : a non-surgical treatment for improving circulation and slowing the aging process","description":"An insightful introduction to chelation therapy, which slows the aging process and opens blocked arteries without surgery or great risk.

Fortunately, she was able to educate herself quickly, and her extensive at-home treatment of her son led to his amazing full recovery. But the journey wasn't easy, and now, in The Autism Sourcebook, Siff Exkorn offers parents the wisdom she wishes she'd had at the beginning. Recent studies show that there is a worldwide epidemic of autism. More than 1.5 million people are affected in the United States alone, with one in every 166 children diagnosed. Early detection and early intervention are two of the key factors in improving prognosis -- but too often, writes Siff Exkorn, parents get bogged down in denial or confusion about the still mysterious disorder, and are unable to take the necessary steps. Providing accessible medical information gleaned from the world's foremost experts, Siff Exkorn offers an inside look at families with children who have autism, and ties in her own firsthand experience as a parent. The author shares valuable knowledge about the following: What the diagnosis really means Understanding and accessing treatment options Knowing your child's rights in the school system Coping with common marital and familial stress Making the stigma of autism a thing of the past With extensive appendices, including the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Diagnostic Criteria for the Five Pervasive Developmental Disorders, and carefully selected lists of Internet resources, recommended readings, and top autism organizations worldwide, The Autism Sourcebook is the single most comprehensive, practical resource available to parents and loved ones of children with autism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aUcZHzvUqwYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Committed: Confessions of a Fantasy Football Junkie","description":"A definitive overview of the popular game of fantasy football traces the history of the popular phenomenon and discusses the strategies, rules, players, and other key aspects of the national pastime. 50,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9eaeUCzyqZcC&dq=Committed:+Confessions+of+a+Fantasy+Football+Junkie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft SQL Server 7 Administrator's Guide W/CD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eRfDNVqLd6EC&dq=Microsoft+SQL+Server+7+Administrator%27s+Guide+W/CD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kathy Cooks: Vegetarian, Low Cholesterol (Art of Dieting Without Dieting)","description":"Kathy Hoshijo has taught millions of Americans how to cook healthy, meatless, low-cholesterol meals on her weekly nationwide PBS television series.

Collections of case histories, casebooks, are now widely used in all sorts of specialties other than in their familiar appli cation to law and medicine. The case method had its formal beginning at Harvard in 1871 when Christopher Lagdell developed it as a means of teaching. It was so successful in teaching law that it was soon adopted in medical education, and the collection of cases provided the raw material for research on various diseases. Subsequently, the case history approach spread to such varied fields as business, psychology, management, and economics, and there are over 100 books in print that use this approach. The idea for a series of Casehooks in Earth Science grew from my experience in organizing and editing a collection of examples of one variety of sedimentary deposits. The prqject began as an effort to bring some order to a large number of descriptions of these deposits that were so varied in presentation and terminology that even specialists found them difficult to compare and analyze. Thus, from the beginning, it was evident that something more than a simple collection of papers was needed.

En als er voor zijn deur een jongen verschijnt die beweert zijn zoon te zijn, wordt Micah opnieuw geconfronteerd met een verrassing waar hij niet mee om kan gaan. In Een rooie aan de kant van de weg schetst Anne Tyler een intiem en geestig beeld van een man die degenen om hem heen ziet als net buiten zijn bereik.

This edition of selected writings, the first to make a wide range of Frederick s most important ideas available to a modern English readership, moves beyond traditional attempts to see his work only in light of his political aims. In these pages, we can finally appreciate Frederick s influential contributions to the European Enlightenment and his unusual role as a monarch who was also a published author. In addition to Frederick s major opus, the Anti-Machiavel, the works presented here include essays, prefaces, reviews, and dialogues. The subjects discussed run the gamut from ethics to religion to political theory. Accompanied by critical annotations, the texts show that we can understand Frederick s views of kingship and the state only if we engage with a broad spectrum of his thought, including his attitudes toward morality and self-love. By contextualizing his arguments and impact on Enlightenment beliefs, this volume considers how we can reconcile Frederick s innovative public musings with his absolutist rule. Avi Lifschitz provides a robust and detailed introduction that discusses Frederick s life and work against the backdrop of eighteenth-century history and politics. With its unparalleled scope and cross-disciplinary appeal, Frederick the Great s Philosophical Writings firmly establishes one monarch s multifaceted relevance for generations of readers and scholars to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BjwCEAAAQBAJ&dq=Frederick+the+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Stone: A Jacob Lomax Mystery","description":"After a colleague dies, Lomax get roped into a deadly search for missing gems Four gunmen storm a jewelry store in downtown Denver, wounding a guard and killing a child.

Once-treasured art and literature are now despised. ? Silently holding his ground, Boualem withstands the new regime, using the shop and his personal history as weapons against puritanical forces. Readers are taken into the lush depths of the bookseller's dreams, the memories of his now-empty family life, his passion for literature, then yanked back into the terror and drudgery of his daily routine by the vandalism, assaults, and death warrants that afflict him. ?

Stephen Smith comes to live on the island, and his search for the real Cuba inevitably becomes a search for Fidel Castro too. Before meeting his quarry, Smith travels extensively through the 'land of miracles' in an old American automobile. His highly-personalised account features a bloody initiation into a voodoo-like cult, dining on giant rat, and checking into the Love Hotel. And he goes on manoeuvres in the Everglades with armed, but not especially competent, Cuban exiles dreaming of a second Bay of Pigs. With disarming wit and considerable insight, Stephen Smith investigates a country where communism and voodoo coexist, and where the influence of its leader of forty years continues to throw a long shadow.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WEUuGuNM7toC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern exterior ballistics: The launch and flight dynamics of symmetric projectiles","description":"Modern Exterior Ballistics is a comprehensive text covering the basic free flight dynamics of symmetric projectiles. The book provides a historical perspective of early developments in the 19th century, the technology leading to World War I and that through World War II into the modern post-war era. Historical topics include the first ballistic firing tables, early wind tunnel experiments, the development of free flight spark ranges and the first supercomputer, ENIAC, which was designed to compute artillery trajectories for the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory. The level of the text requires an undergraduate education in mathematics, physics, and mechanical or aerospace engineering. The basic principles of ballistic science are developed from a comprehensive definition of the aerodynamic forces that control the flight dynamics of symmetric projectiles. The author carefully starts with the basic vacuum point mass trajectory, adds the effects of drag, discusses the action of winds, simple flat fire approximations, Coriolis effects and concludes with the classic modified point mass trajectories. Included in the discussion are analytical methods, change of variables from time to distance, numerical solutions and a chapter on the Siacci Method. The Siacci Method provides a historical perspective for computing flat fire trajectories by simple quadrature and is used in the sporting arms industy. The final six chapters of the book present an extensive physical and mathematical analysis of the motion of symmetric projectiles. The linearized equations of angular and swerving motion are derived in detail. The effects of mass asymmetry, in-bore yaw, cross wind and launch in a slipstream are discussed. Special consideration is given to the derivation and explanation of aerodynamic jump. These subjects are then expanded to include a complete chapter on nonlinear aerodynamic forces and moments. The final chapter in the book presents an overview of experimental methods for measuring the flight dynamics of projectiles. The great forte of Modern Exterior Ballistics is the author's effort to provide many fine specific examples of projectile motion illustrating key flight behaviors. The extensive collection of data on projectiles from small arms to artillery used to substantiate calculations and examples is alone a valuable reference. The ultimate joy of the book is the incomparable comprehensive set of flow field shadow graphs illustrating the entire spectrum of projectile flight from subsonic, through transonic and supersonic. The volume is a necessary addition to any undergraduate or graduate course in flight dynamics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sUUxuQAACAAJ&dq=Modern+exterior+ballistics:+The+launch+and+flight+dynamics+of+symmetric+projectiles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capital Navy","description":"Joseph Moretz's innovative work focuses on what battleships actually did in the inter-war years and what its designed war role in fact was. In doing so, the book tells us much about British naval policy and planning of the time. Drawing heavily on official Admiralty records and private papers of leading officers, the author examines the navy's operational experience and the evolution of its tactical doctrine during the interwar period. He argues that operational experience, combined with assumptions about the nature of a future naval war, were more important in keeping the battleship afloat than conservatism in Navy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lvgrBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanglish : The Making of a New American Language","description":"With the release of the census figures in 2000, Latino America wasanointed the future driving force of American culture. The emergence of Spanglish as a form of communication is one of the more influential markers of an America gone Latino. Spanish, present on this continent since the fifteenth century, when Iberian explorers sought to colonize territories in what are now Florida, New Mexico, Texas, and California, has become ubiquitous in the last few decades. The nation's unofficial second language, it is highly visible on several 24-hour TV networks and on more than 200 radio stations across the country. But Spanish north of the Rio Grande has not spread in its pure Iberian form. On the contrary, a signature of the brewing \\"Latin Fever\\" that has swept the United States since the mid-1980s is the astonishing creative linguistic amalgam of tongues used by people of Hispanic descent, not only in major cities but in rural areas as well -- neither Spanish nor English, but a hybrid, known only as Spanglish.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eRK3GtQfIn8C&dq=Spanglish+:+The+Making+of+a+New+American+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insiders' Guide to Austin, 4th (Insiders' Guide Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k6692W5sYakC&dq=Insiders%27+Guide+to+Austin,+4th+(Insiders%27+Guide+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treating the Self: Elements of Clinical Self Psychology (ISBN: 0898627176)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Living Under South Street: Photographs of South Philadelphia by Jonathan Elderfield","description":"Elderfield has found a very personal photographic approach towards residents, streets, and life of \\"South Philly.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hZfBohvATv0C&dq=Living+Under+South+Street:+Photographs+of+South+Philadelphia+by+Jonathan+Elderfield&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The mysterious past (A Berkley medallion book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Frp3AAAACAAJ&dq=The+mysterious+past+(A+Berkley+medallion+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McKinlay's Journal of exploration in the interior of Australia: (Burke Relief Expedition) (Australiana fascimile editions)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2H47AQAAMAAJ&dq=McKinlay%27s+Journal+of+exploration+in+the+interior+of+Australia:+(Burke+Relief+Expedition)+(Australiana+fascimile+editions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farm, Shop, Landing: The Rise of a Market Society in the Hudson Valley, 1780&ndash;1860","description":"DIVBruegel shows how the development of a market economy created historical change in a parochial community./div","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y9kXgcVM65sC&dq=Farm,+Shop,+Landing:+The+Rise+of+a+Market+Society+in+the+Hudson+Valley,+1780&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morrisey Shot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jJcwAAAACAAJ&dq=Morrisey+Shot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, November 1940-May 1943","description":"Describes the events that led to the German invasion of Poland and the three-week siege of the city of Warsaw; examines the daily life of ghetto-imprisoned Jews, the work of social welfare groups and underground activists, cooperative smuggling by city and ghetto citizens, and the overwhelming disease and starvation of the ghetto; and details the foredoomed street uprising by a population that chose to \\"die with honor.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jaxAAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+uprising+of+the+Warsaw+ghetto,+November+1940-May+1943&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England 1530-1630","description":"More than 150 works of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs and their coutiers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YsfpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dynasties:+Painting+in+Tudor+and+Jacobean+England+1530-1630&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SWqXDAEACAAJ&dq=Comprehensive+History+of+the+Church+of+Jesus+Christ+of+the+Latter+Day+Saints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hard Eight","description":"The #1 bestselling phenomenon continues in the eighth Stephanie Plum novel.

At the center of all these phenomena is the warrior. Though this archetype seems to manifest contradictory values, author Daniele Bolelli describes the heart of this tension: how the training of martial technique leads to a renunciation of violence, and how overcoming fear leads to a unique freedom. Aimed at students at any level or tradition of martial arts but also accessible to the armchair warrior, On the Warrior s Path brings fresh insights to why martial arts remains an enduring and widespread art and discipline.

The Stratofortress entered active service in 1955 and is scheduled to continue as part of the air force's inventory through 2040. The jet-powered bomber was a mainstay of America's Cold War nuclear-deterrent strategy, providing air power that balanced the land and sea military forces. The massive plane also served as the launch platform for the experimental X-15 hypersonic rocket aircraft. Due to its versatility as an aircraft, the B-52 has seen combat service in all of America's military conflicts since it came on active duty: Vietnam, the first and second Gulf wars, and the War in Afghanistan. B-52 Stratofortress also covers every aspect of the aircraft's development, manufacture, and modification. These technical details set the stage for its military service, starting with its role as a nuclear bomber in the Cold War even though only conventional weapons have been used during its combat duty. The airplane s service in key campaigns in Vietnam is covered, followed by the quieter years after it. The B-52 returned to prominence in the Gulf Wars and Afghanistan, taking part in massive bombing campaigns in both conflicts. Finally, the book ends with the constant upgrades that will keep the B-52 an integral part of U.S. airpower for decades to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-vFKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic, 1763-89","description":"In The Birth of the Republic, 176389, Edmund S.

Although telephone, cable, broadcast, print, and Internet companies are changing at a fantastic rate, the fundamentals of communications, networks, and competition have remained constant. This book provides the tools necessary to build lasting, flexible strategies to survive and grow in these times of transition. Whether you are a business executive, lawmaker, policy analyst, industrialist, stock analyst, lawyer, or judge, these tools will help you to solve real problems right away. The toolkit contains six tools -- essentially ways to view the workings of the communications sector from a larger, more inclusive perspective. The tools draw on knowledge and concepts from communications, engineering, biology, business, and law. Tool #1, New Building Blocks, presents the big picture of the communications sector. Tool #2, Networks, develops the fundamental parts and processes found in all networks. Tool #3, Competition and Cooperation, presents the basic characteristics shared by most processes in which two or more entities compete or cooperate to obtain a scarce resource. Tool #4, The Three Visions of Convergence, sorts out the many things people mean when they say \\"convergence.\\" Tool #5, Convergence Theology, shows how people's faith (or lack of it) in convergence influences their predictions for the future. Finally, Tool #6, Concentration/Diversity, focuses on the forces that drive things together and those that pull them apart. The book also discusses how the tools can be used to understand and influence public policy issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nhVRxTOe1RwC&dq=The+Communications+Toolkit:+How+to+Build+and+Regulate+Any+Communications+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windmills of New England: Their Genius, Madness, History & Future","description":"With an almost quixotic dedication to his subject, Dan Lombardo has scoured countrysides, seasides and archives in a quest to comprehend the fascinating history and exciting future of the windmills of New England. Combing a fun approach with scholarly rigor, he examines the many ways windmills revolutionized the lives of our ancestors, just as modern wind power is now poised to change local and perhaps even world politics. Indeed, with wind farms now producing electricity at prices that are highly competitive with all other sources?and generating ?electrical? controversies in the local and national news?this book could not be any more timely. Lombardo takes his readers along with him on a journey to the antique remains of wooden windmills to meet the people who care for and treasure them. He introduces us to young apprentices learning to grind corn, artists using windmills as studios, and even an engineer who single-handedly operates a major modern electric wind farm.Lombardo explores the powerful poetic and literary uses of windmills, their imagery in film, their impact on language, and their place in popular culture, such as in residential and commercial architecture, as lawn ornaments, and as perennial obstacles on mini-golf courses. Along the way, he has collected more than 160 photographs, vintage postcards and other renderings. This invaluable volume is complete with online and other resources, a useful index, and a series of windmill tours to assist readers with their own windmill adventures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1H0bAQAAMAAJ&dq=Windmills+of+New+England:+Their+Genius,+Madness,+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Full of Grace: A Novel","description":"A moving story of the power of love and the miracles of life chock full of Southern wit, sass, and charm Grace is an intelligent, (struggling-to-be) independent 31-year-old single woman living (in sin!) with the man she d marry if they both weren t so commitment phobic.

Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world. Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons. Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebrates the unflappable American spirit. Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. \\"The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects.\\" To America is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sWXJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaii (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","description":"The DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Hawaii is your indispensable guide to this beautiful part of the world.

In this provocative book, Kern Robert Trembath reviews seven major evangelical explanations of inspiration and demonstrates that all either view the Bible itself as the actual recipient of inspiration or explain biblical authority on grounds more appropriate to the doctrine of God--in effect investing the Bible with characteristics that properly belong only to God. Building on the work of William Abraham, Trembath constructs his own theory of inspiration--one that regards inspiration as a tripartite concept involving the elements of initiator, means, and receiver. He insists that only a human being can be the recipient of inspiration and that the Bible must therefore be understood as the means, rather than the end, of the process. He goes on to articulate a new definition of biblical inspiration--as \\"a mediated enhancement of human experience by God, through the Bible\\"--and argues that this new understanding of inspiration is most compatible with a Thomistic doctrine of God, which insists that God's acts are mediated through the world, rather than immediately occurring in it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9w1gfWXOpo4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blessed Are the Cheesemakers","description":"Set on a small Irish dairy farm, this tender and funny debut novel follows two lost souls as they try to carve out new lives amid a colorful cast of characters reminiscent of those in the hit film Waking Ned Divine.

All of the papers in the volume were read at two sessions at SBL (2005 and 2006) that were co-sponsored by the Social Sciences and the Hebrew Bible Section of SBL and the American Schools of Oriental Research. The sessions were designed to promote dialogue among scholars by juxtaposing research based in the social sciences and archaeology. Scholars contributed papers from within their own methodological and research perspective, but addressed possible interactions and overlaps that their research might contribute to the complementary perspective. Significant intersections between the approaches emerged when patterns of social interactions accessed by social scientific methods paralleled patterns in material remains accessed by archaeological methods. The sessions and thus the book achieve coherence because all of the papers attended to aspects of the family in ancient Israel. While the presenters selected their own topics in the subject area, several foci emerged that reflect current research interests in these fields. These foci include research on ancestors and the cult of the dead, configurations of family house structures, and family relational interactions. All of the papers make their methods and approaches visible and delineate clearly the textual or material basis of their research, so that the dialogue among the papers is facilitated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EqKoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to Chinese Medicine - Between Heaven and Earth","description":" Comprehensive, encyclopedic, and lucid, this book is a must for all practitioners of the healing arts who want to broaden their understanding.

The Louvre Palace was expanded, Notre-Dame Cathedral was restored and the French masterpiece of the Second Empire, the Op ra Garnier, was built. A very large part of what we see when we visit Paris today originates from this short span of twenty-two years. The vision for the new Nineteenth Century Paris belonged to Napoleon III, who had led a long and difficult climb to absolute power. But his plans faltered until he brought in a civil servant, Georges-Eug ne Haussmann, to take charge of the implementation. Heedless of controversy, at tremendous cost, Haussmann pressed ahead with the giant undertaking until, in 1870, his political enemies brought him down, just months before the collapse of the whole regime brought about the end of an era. Paris Reborn is a must-read for anyone who ever wondered how Paris, the city universally admired as a standard of urban beauty, became what it is.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o2srT7oPQwwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rainaldi Quartet","description":"Gianni Castiglione has a pleasant, quiet life in Cremona.

In 1989, he returned to the village as an anthropologist to begin the unparalleled span of eleven years  fieldwork that has resulted in this book a comprehensive, vivid, and nuanced account of family change and the transformation of private life in rural China from 1949 to 1999.

Yan explores private lives to examine areas of family life that have been largely overlooked, such as emotion, desire, intimacy, privacy, conjugality, and individuality. He concludes that the past five decades have witnessed a dual transformation of private life: the rise of the private family, within which the private lives of individual women and men are thriving.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d50_CqXVKIoC&dq=Private+Life+under+Socialism:+Love,+Intimacy,+and+Family+Change+in+a+Chinese+Village,+1949-1999&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masonic Initiation","description":"The Masonic Initiation is the powerful sequel to W.

The ability to present a putative signal in isolation, without the potential confounding effects of other activities of the signaller, is the main reason for the depth and range of our knowledge of communication systems. To date, playback of sound signals has predominated, but playback of electric signals and even video playback of visual signals suggests that playback will become just as prevalent in studies of communication in other sensory modalities. This book is one of the outcomes of a workshop on playback held at Thombridge Hall in the Peak District National Park, England during August 1991. There were two reasons for organising the workshop. First, the considerable and lively debate in the literature about the design and analysis of playback experiments -the pseudoreplication debate -was in danger of generating more heat than light. A workshop forum seemed the obvious place to clarify and, if possible, resolve the debate. Second, with the number of new playback and analysis techniques increasing rapidly, it seemed an opportune moment to discuss these techniques and to review some rapidly developing areas of interest in sound communication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A6vqBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Prehistory, in New Perspective","description":"The origins and development of human culture throughout the world are re-examined in this new, generously illustrated edition of Clark's famous work.

Engulfing most of present-day Germany, the war claimed at least ten million lives. The lengthy conflict was particularly hard on the general population, as thousands of undisciplined mercenaries serving Sweden, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and various German principalities, robbed, murdered, and pillaged communities; disease spread out of control and starvation became commonplace. In The Warwolf, Hermann L?ns's acclaimed historical novel, the tragedy and horrors of war in general, and these times in particular are revealed. The Warwolf, based on the author's careful research, traces the life of Harm Wulf, a land-owning peasant farmer of the northern German heath who realizes after witnessing the murder of neighbours and family at the hands of marauding troops that he has a choice between compromising his morals or succumbing to inevitable torture and death. Despite his desire for peace, Wulf decides to band with his fellow farmers and live like \\"wolves,\\" fiercely protecting their isolated communities from all intruders. L?ns's brilliant portrayal of the two sides faced by any person in a moral crisis--in Harm Wulf's case, whether to kill or be killed--continues to resonate. Originally published in 1910 and still in print in Germany, The Warwolf is available for first time in English.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b9RgtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Warwolf:+A+Peasant+Chronicle+of+the+Thirty+Years+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discovering Famous Graves (Shire Discovering)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0JhKPgAACAAJ&dq=Discovering+Famous+Graves+(Shire+Discovering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruffian (Thoroughbred Legends, Number 13)","description":"Ruffian's tragic story still has a powerful hold over horse racing enthusiasts.
