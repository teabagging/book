Hill; Lee's forgotten general","description":"A. P. Hill: Lee's Forgotten General is the first biography of the Confederacy's long-neglected hero whom Lee ranked next to Jackson and Longstreet. Although the name and deeds ot this gallant Virginian conspicuously punctuate the record of every major campaign of the Army of Northern Virginia, the man himself has persistently remained what Douglas Southall Freman termed an \\"elusive personality.\\" William Woods Hassler, through careful and persistent research, has compiled an interesting documentary study from which emerges a balanced portrait of this distinguished but complex character. Here for the first time is detailed the romantic triangle which enmeshed Hill and McClellan, former roommates at West Point, with beauteous Nelly Marcy, reigning queen of pre-war Washington's younger set. Hill lost this contest to Nelly's parents, but he later won the hand of General John Hunt Morgan's lovely and talented sister, Dolly. And at Sharpsburg, Hill wreaked vengeance upon McClellan by his timely arrival which saved Lee from defeat at the same time it spelled McClellan's subsequent dismissal from command of the Army of the Potomac. The author traces Hill's meteoric rise from Colonel of the redoubtable Thirteenth Virginia Regiment to Major General in command of the famed Light Division. Against a \\"you are there\\" background of intimate detail, the reader follows the exploits of tempestous Ambrose Powell Hill as he welds his officers and men into fierce striking units. Where the fighing is thickests there is the red-haired, red-shirted Hill brandishing his sword and exhorting his men to victory. Sometimes the issue ends ignominiously as at Bristoe Station, but more often the outcome is glorious as at Second Manassas and Reams Station. Gray greats and near-greats stalk through these pages with vivid reality as one meets Jeb Stuart, Dorsey Pender, John Hood, Heros von Borcke, Ham Chamerlayne, Willie Pegram, Rev. J. Wm. Jones, Cadmus Wilcox, Harry Heth, J. R. Anderson, Lawrence O'Brien Branch, James Archer, Jim Lane, Thomas Wooten, Charles Field, George Tucker, Kyd Douglas, Johnston Pettigrew, Moxley Sorrel, William H. Palmer, Wade Hampton, Jube Early, Lindsay Walker, Maxcy Gregg, Sam McGowan, and others. Accompanying Hill and his commands from pre-Manassas to the final breakthrough at Petersburg, the reader relives the campaigns in the Eastern theater. At the same time the reader gains a deeper insight into the problems of command, together with an appreciation of the hardships which the Confederate soldiers endured during even the early days of the conflict. Although Powell Hill's consideration and ability won for him the unbounded respect and devotion of his troops, his proud, sensitive nature continually embroiled him with his superiors. His dispute with Longstreet following the Seven Days Battles almost culminated in a duel. Transferred to Jackson's command, Hill outspokenly quarreled with \\"Old Jack\\" until the latter's mortal wounding at Chancellorsville effected a dramatic battlefield reconciliation. As Jackson's successor, Hill performed irregularly. The author analyzes objectively the various factors which may have caused the changes in Hill's fortunes following his elevation to corps command.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V0bqCQAAQBAJ&dq=A.P.+Hill%3B+Lee%27s+forgotten+general&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coyote Blue","description":"From master of subversive humor Christopher Moore comes a quirky, irreverent novel of love, myth, metaphysics, outlaw biking, angst, and outrageous redemption.

But how can we explain that while practitioners use silence on a daily basis, academics have widely remained quiet on the subject? Why is silence habitually famed as inherently bad and unethical? Silence is neither separate from nor the opposite of communication. The inclusion of silence on a par with speech and non-verbal means is a vital element of any communication strategy; it opens it up for a new, complex and more reflective understanding of strategic silence as indirect communication. Drawing on a number of disciplines that see in silence what public relations academics have not yet, this book reveals forms of silence to inform public relations solutions in practice and theory. How do we manage silence? How can strategic silence increase the capacity of public relations as a change agent? Using a format of multiple short chapters and practice examples, this is the first book that discusses the concept of strategic silence, and its consequences for PR theory and practice. Applying silence to communication cases and issues in global societies, it will be of interest to scholars and researchers in public relations, strategic communications and communication studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bd4rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sabadilla","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fAbcjwEACAAJ&dq=Sabadilla&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forest And The Trees: Sociology as Life, Practice and Promise","description":"New Third Edition!

There are wide variations in the policies pursued, but most countries try to reduce both the supply of and the demand for drugs. Unfortunately, there is little research consensus on the respective merits of these two approaches or about the best ways to pursue them. Consequently, control and prevention policies are mostly driven by political considerations, economic realities and cultural expectations, though research has played an important part in formulating and evaluating treatments for drug addiction. This volume reviews studies on drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies under five main areas: 1. Reducing supply - strategies to control the flow of drugs from production to retail distribution; 2. Reducing demand - prevention of drug use at all stages of involvement and consumption levels; 3. Reducing harm - promoting situational risk reduction practices for regular users, addicts and recreational users; 4. Reducing addiction - drug treatment options for various groups in various settings; and 5. Drug policies and prescriptions - focused on debates about prohibition and legalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lAwkDwAAQBAJ&dq=Communities+That+Care:+Action+for+Drug+Abuse+Prevention+(Jossey-Bass+Social+and+Behavioral+Science+Series/Jossey-Bass+Education+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brother Dusty-Feet","description":"Along with his faithful dog Argos, eleven-year-old Hugh Copplestone decides to leave his Aunt and Uncle's house after one beating too many, and heads for Oxford to seek his fortune.

Meet the most important challenge of education by ensuring that every child can read! The brain is hardwired for spoken language but not for reading. Yet reading skills serve as the primary foundation of all school-based learning. Research indicates that a student's future academic success can be predicted by his or her reading level at the end of third grade. Patricia Wolfe and Pamela Nevills bring insight and assistance to preschool educators, parents and care providers, kindergarten and primary grade teachers for this essential process. They explain the development of the young brain, the acquisition of language as preparation for reading, and the nurturing and instruction process from birth to age eight. This unique guide demonstrates how the brain of a child masters the reading process of decoding print and reading with fluency and comprehension and addresses related literacy skills of writing and spelling. Brain-friendly strategies that lay the groundwork for reading success include: Activities to support phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension, and fluency; Applications of games, music, play, and instruction; Intervention suggestions for children who are challenged or discouraged early readers. Learning to read is a complex, gradual process that begins in infancy and Building the Reading Brain, PreK-3 provides insights and guidelines to help early childhood educators, parents, and care providers and K-3 teachers to meet the challenge of insuring that every child learns to read with fluency and comprehension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mtVLZUSh_gAC&dq=Building+the+Reading+Brain,+PreK-3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart of Interview With an Angel","description":"In a dynamic two-year interview an angel answers your most compelling questions.

No American sporting event can claim the history, tradition, or pageantry that the Kentucky Derby holds. For more than 130 years, spectators have been fascinated by the magnificent horses that run the Louisville track. Thoroughbreds such as Secretariat and Barbaro have earned instant international fame, along with jockeys such as Isaac Murphy, Ron Turcotte, and Calvin Borel. The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America's Premier Sporting Event calls this great tradition to post and illuminates its history and culture. Rising from its humble beginnings as an American variation of England's Epsom Derby, the Kentucky Derby became a centerpiece of American sports and the racing industry, confirming Kentucky's status as the Horse Capital of the World. James C. Nicholson argues that the Derby, at its essence, is a celebration of a place, existing as a connection between Kentucky's mythic past and modern society. The Derby is more than just a horse race -- it is an experience enhanced by familiar traditions, icons, and images that help Derby fans to understand Kentucky and define themselves as Americans. Today the Kentucky Derby continues to attract international attention from royalty, celebrities, racing fans, and those who simply enjoy an icy mint julep, a fabulous hat, and a wager on who will make it to the winner's circle. Nicholson provides an intriguing and thorough history of the Kentucky Derby, examining the tradition, spectacle, culture, and evolution of the Kentucky Derby -- the brightest jewel of the Triple Crown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jOFVaVgN_tQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With or Without School","description":"Discusses how parents can create a home environment that encourages children to learn and explains what is right and wrong with traditional education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gvZEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Guerrilla+Learning:+How+to+Give+Your+Kids+a+Real+Education+With+or+Without+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality","description":"A popular minister recounts his zealous early life pursuit of the Christian life and his experiences of emptiness and spiritual detachment, tracing his quest to connect with a God he perceived as distant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fNC3fdxYgZMC&dq=Blue+Like+Jazz:+Nonreligious+Thoughts+on+Christian+Spirituality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bill, the Galactic hero","description":"Bill was a peaceful farm boy until he was lured by the martial music of a passing recruitment sergeant, drugged, and made to enlist in the Empire Space Corps.

In the desert south of Barstow, California, the A.S.F.S.F. was building a space ship, purportedly for research purposes, but as Novak commenced his assigned experiments he detected many incongruous facts about the project. He soon began to suspect that the construction of the ship was being subsidized by a foreign power, and he confided his fears to a fellow engineer. Within twenty-four hours this confidant had been killed.

It discusses whether a speculative logic is possible at all and whether Hegelian logic requires a metalogic or whether it can and ought to make an absolute beginning. It examines, conceptually and historically, the being-nothing dialectic, the relation of essence to show (Schein), and Hegel?s treatment of the modal categories. It proposes radically different views of the role of the ?understanding? in Hegelian logic and a radically different view of the necessity underlying it. The book concludes with the argument that Hegel?s dialectical logic can cope with a problem that Aristotle?s could not. Essays on Hegel?s Logic provides a welcome introduction to those interested in this central piece of Hegel?s system, and it poses the question of whether, and how, the logic provides a closure to the system. In different ways, and with different degrees of explicitness, the book deals precisely with this issue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W8co_5mOG3cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knight's Forensic Pathology","description":"The fourth edition of Knight's Forensic Pathologycontinues to be the definitive international resource for those in training and in practice, covering all aspects of the medico-legal autopsy, including the cause and time of death, interpretation of wounds and every other facet of the investigation of a fatality.

In this new edition the text has been thoroughly updated and is complemented by the addition of over 200 new colour illustrations.

Written by a high-profile American phonologist, the book presents an analysis of new generalizations about the surface shapes of English words. It will not only be the most up to date introduction to English phonology, but will also provide the clearest available account of Optimality Theory. Its combination of accessibility, originality and clear analysis make this essential reading for all those interested in the sounds of English words and some of the latest developments in linguistics theory. - ;The Phonology of English offers a new approach to English phonology. It focuses on the prosody of the language, i.e. syllable and foot structure, and does so from an optimality-theoretic (OT) perspective. The focus is on surface distributional regularities and the results presented are based on extensive searches through various computerized lexicons. The outcome is a number of new generalizations about the phonology of English, along with confirmation of some familiar regularities. All of these empirical results are discussed in detail and presented in extensive charts with a plethora of examples. The Phonology of English also offers a unique OT analysis. This provides a detailed introduction to the intricacies of the theory as applied to a significant amount of data. A number of important theoretical proposals are developed in this model, and the analysis presents the idea that certain complex constraints and their ranking can be derived in restricted ways from more basic constraints. In addition, the book also develops the idea that syllables of English can contain from zero to three moras. It is suggested that the phonology of English only makes sense if partial morphemes of the cranberry sort are licensed more widely. The book is thus intended as a detailed presentation of novel empirical results about the sound system of English, along with important theoretical results about phonological theory. -","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fJ6yivf6Kv0C&dq=The+Phonology+of+English:+A+Prosodic+Optimality-Theoretic+Approach+(The+Phonology+of+the+World%27s+Languages)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outlearning the Wolves : Surviving and Thriving in a Learning Organization, Second Edition","description":"Outlearning the Wolves 3rd Edition: Surviving and Thriving in a Learning Organization Robert Fritz calls this fable a true classic that demonstrates how \\"a good story can be one of the best sources of profound change.\\" Now available in 11 languages; the book continues to find new audiences and win the hearts of those who embrace its lessons.

Facing the end, James looked back over his life with a clear-eyed and unflinching honesty to produce his finest work: poems of extraordinary power that spoke to our most elemental emotions. Injury Time, following Sentenced to Life, finds James with more time on the clock than he had anticipated, and all the more determined to use it wisely  to capture the treasurable moment, and think about how best to live his remaining days while the sense of his own impending absence grows all the more powerfully acute. In a series of intimate poems  from childhood memories of his mother, to a vision of his granddaughter in graceful acrobatic flight  James declares  family  to be our greatest blessing. He also writes beautifully of the Australia where he began his life, and where he hopes to 'reach the end'. Throughout Injury Time, James weaves poems which reflect on the consolation and wisdom to be found in the art, music and books which have become ever more precious to him in his last years. The poems in this moving, inspirational and unsentimental book are as accomplished as any he has ever written; indeed the unexpected gift of James's Injury Time shows him to be in the form of his life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jk0rDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Border Storm","description":"Amanda Scott concludes her thrilling Border trilogy with the incandescent story of a woman and a man who are mortal foes . . . until they re undone by love The rebellious daughter of a Scottish march warden, Lady Laurie Halliot is as fearless as she is beautiful.

Its features include - (1) Field Testing the Communication of Divine Message: The unique feature of this translation is its field testing for over 3 1/2 years to improve the communication and understanding of the Divine Message. Translation passages were given to the New Muslim and Non-Muslim high school and college students for reading under the supervision of various Ulema (scholars). After reading, the person was asked to explain as to what he/she understood from the passage. If his/her understanding was the same as is in the Arabic Text of the Holy Qur'an then we concluded that we have been successful in conveying the Divine Message properly. If his/her understanding was different than what the Qur'anic verses were stating, we kept on rewording the translation until those verses were understood properly. It was tremendous patience on part of the participants. May Allah reward them all. (2) Simplicity: In this translation Simple Language and Direct Approach is used for appealing to the common sense of scholars and common people. (3) Understandability: There are no foot notes to refer and no commentary or lengthy explanations to read. All necessary explanations have been incorporated right there in the text with italic type setting to differentiate from the translation of the meanings of Qur'anic Arabic Text. (4) Outline of Pertinent Information: Before the start of each Srah, information relating to its Period of Revelation, Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance has been presented as an outline. Then a summary of the preceding events has been tabulated for the reader to understand the histo! rical background to grasp the full meaning of the Divine Message. (5) Reviews, Input and Approvals: This project was started in 1991 and initial draft completed in 1994. Then the Translation was sent to different Ulema (Scholars) in Town and throughout United States for their review and input. After their reviews and input it was sent to Jme Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Egypt, Ummal Qur in Saudi Arabia and International Islamic University in Pakistan for their review, input and approval. This translation was published after their reviews and approvals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pLlXCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle: The Story of the Bulge","description":"\\"The perspective of 15 years, painstaking research, thousands of interviews, extensive analysis and evaluation, and the creative talent of John Toland [paint] the epic struggle on an immense canvas. . . .

And in boxing perhaps none is more qualified to answer the question than Bert Randolph Sugar. In Boxing's Greatest Fighters, not only does the former publisher of Ring Magazine tell us who the best fighters were, he lists them in order. Could Sugar Ray Robinson have beaten Muhammad Ali? Could Sugar Ray Leonard have beaten Sonny Liston? The answer, most experts agree, would be \\"no.\\" But what if, as Bert Sugar has done here, one were to take all the boxers and reduce them in the mind's eye to the same height, the same weight, and the same ring conditions? The answers would be quite different. And while some fans may express outrage that Rocky Marciano barely makes the top twenty, and Marvin Hagler staggers into the top seventy-five, others will nod eagerly when they read that Harry Greb and Benny Leonard were better than just about anybody.

The book focused world attention on Guatemala and led to her being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. In 1999, a book by David Stoll challenged the veracity of key details in Menchu's account, generating a storm of controversy. Journalists and scholars squared off regarding whether Menchu had lied about her past and, if so, what that would mean about the larger truths revealed in her book. In The Rigoberta Menchu Controversy, Arturo Arias has assembled a casebook that offers a balanced perspective on the debate. The first section of this volume collects the primary documents -- newspaper articles, interviews, and official statements -- in which the debate raged, many translated into English for the first time. In the second section, a distinguished group of international scholars assesses the political, historical, and cultural contexts of the debate, and considers its implications for such issues as the \\"culture wars\\", historical truth, and the politics of memory.

They soon married other people, but the two couples then became closest friends. After seven years of that closeness, Eleanor and Ralph realized that they were profoundly in love. Both went through bitter and punitive divorces to get to each other. It was worth it. They have now been married for 45 years. This book is the story of their love and marriage, told through the myriad objects that have played a significant role in that story. Gifts, homes, cars, painting, books, furniture, jewelry, clothes--all are invested with a deeply emotional value that grew out of what those objects of desire meant to these two people. But the story does not apply only to these two particular people. As Ralph Graves says about these objects of desire, They have resonance. Each of us, in every love story, in every marriage, can name special objects that carry that resonance. The objects are different for each of us, but the resonance is the same.

Today, however, it is an adult activity with a vast following around the world. Subsequently, a large cottage industry has developed to supply the demands of modellers who want more than kit manufacturers can supply. Written in an easy-to-read style, this book's chapters address each of the following: -- A history of the model car industry -- The practicalities of modelling, from assembling a basic kit to super-detailing (i.e., adding engine wiring, brake lines, and \\"chrome\\") -- Painting and finishing -- Creating dioramas -- Renovating old kits and collecting rare ones Although Mat Concentrates on the most popular 1:25 and 1:32 scales, all of the information included is relevant to other scales. And it will be of interest to the novice and experienced modeller alike; the former will learn useful skills, while the latter will hone skills already gained. A gallery of photos showing Mat's finest models provides inspiration and ideas for all modellers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1W4FAAAACAAJ&dq=Mat+Irvine%27s+Auto+Modelling+Masterclass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linus Pauling on science and peace;: The Nobel peace prize lecture (Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions.

Free at AionianBible.org and Google Playstore! What is an un-translation? Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter. Four well-known transliterations are Christ, baptism, angel, and apostle. The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a lexicon. The Aionian Bible un-translates and instead transliterates ten additional Aionian Glossary words to help us better understand God's love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The key Greek word un-translated in the Aionian Bible is aionios, typically translated as eternal and also world or age. However, aionios means something much more wonderful than eternal! Ancient Greeks used the adjective aionios to mean entirety, complete, and even consummate, but never infinite time. Read Dr. Keizer, and Ramelli and Konstan for proofs. So aionios is the perfect description of God's Word which has everything we need for life and godliness! And the aionios life promised in John 3:16 is not a simple ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to a consummate life now! Visit AionianBible.org/Preface for further explanation. The un-translation helps us to see aionios and the additional Aionian Glossary words in context. The original translation is not changed at all and an inline note is appended to sixty-three Old Testament and two hundred three New Testament verses. Also to facilitate parallel study and use of Strong's Concordance, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard. The Aionian Bible republishes public domain Bible texts. We thank our sources at ebible.org, unbound.biola.edu, and dbs.org.

However, few, if any, of these books are written at a level appropriate for students approaching the subject for the first time. An Elementary Approach to Homological Algebra fills that void. Designed to meet the needs of beginning graduate students, it presents the material in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. Complete, detailed proofs make the material easy to follow, numerous worked examples help readers understand the concepts, and an abundance of exercises test and solidify their understanding. Often perceived as dry and abstract, homological algebra nonetheless has important applications in many important areas. The author highlights some of these, particularly several related to group theoretic problems, in the concluding chapter. Beyond making classical homological algebra accessible to students, the author's level of detail, while not exhaustive, also makes the book useful for self-study and as a reference for researchers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MnAMnwEACAAJ&dq=An+Elementary+Approach+to+Homological+Algebra+(Monographs+and+Surveys+in+Pure+and+Applied+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King Coal, a novel.

In fact, some of the most sophisticated and influential observation methods for sampling vertebrate social behavior grew out of baboon studies, invented by scientists who were trying to cope with the intricacies of baboon behavior. Barbara Smuts' eloquent study of baboons reveals a new depth to their behavior and extends the theories needed to account for it.While adhering to the most scrupulous methodological strictures, the author maintains an open research strategy--respecting her subjects by approaching them with the open mind of an ethnographer and immersing herself in the complexities of baboon social life before formulating her research design, allowing her to detect and document a new level of subtlety in their behavior. At the Gilgil site, described in this book, she could stroll and sit within a few feet of her subjects. By maintaining such proximity she was able to watch and listen to intimate exchanges within the troop; she was able, in other words, to shift the baboons well along the continuum from \\"\\"subject\\"\\" to \\"\\"informant.\\"\\" By doing so she has illuminated new networks of special relationships in baboons. This empirical contribution accompanies theoretical insights that not only help to explain many of the inconsistencies of previous studies but also provide the foundation for a whole new dimension in the study of primate behavior: analysis oft he dynamics of long-term, intimate relationships and their evolutionary significance.At every stage of research human observers have underestimated the baboon. These intelligent, curious, emotional, and long-lived creatures are capable of employing stratagems and forming relationships that are not easily detected by traditional research methods.

As producer, emcee, and friend to the Hayride performers, Logan gives us a personal look into musical history - from Hank Williams's ups and downs to the teenage Elvis's first performance on national radio to the ways the Hayride's many emerging stars expanded our idea about what country music could be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MVzkCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Fair Lady: E-Z Play Today Volume 77","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z50wAQAAIAAJ&dq=My+Fair+Lady:+E-Z+Play+Today+Volume+77&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fifty Greatest Conspiracies of All Time: History's Biggest Mysteries, Coverups, and Cabals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GthNAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Fifty+Greatest+Conspiracies+of+All+Time:+History%27s+Biggest+Mysteries,+Coverups,+and+Cabals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The White Peacock (Complete Works)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S3Y_YgEACAAJ&dq=The+White+Peacock+(Complete+Works)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jerusalem, the emanation of the giant Albion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2k_fzAEACAAJ&dq=Jerusalem,+the+emanation+of+the+giant+Albion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gridrunner (A Star*Drive(r) Novel)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2HtVAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gridrunner+(A+Star*Drive(r)+Novel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1770-1790 Census of the Cumberland Settlements: Davidson, Sumner, and Tennessee Counties","description":"The earliest surviving federal enumerations of the Tennessee Country consist of the 1810 census of Rutherford County and an incomplete 1820 census.

This work is an attempt to reconstruct a census of the Cumberland River settlements in Davidson, Sumner, and Tennessee counties, which today comprise all or part of forty Tennessee counties. To this end, Mr. Fulcher has abstracted from the public records all references to those living in the jurisdictions between 1770 and 1790.

Synthesizing more than a decade of research in the wild, this book offers a detailed account of the behavior and ecology of cheetahs. Compared with other large cats, and other mammals, cheetahs have an unusual breeding system; whereas lions live in prides and tigers are solitary, some cheetahs live in groups while others live by themselves. Tim Caro explores group and solitary living among cheetahs and discovers that the causes of social behavior vary dramatically, even within a single species. Why do cheetah cubs stay with their mother for a full year after weaning? Why do adolescents remain in groups? Why do adult males live in permanent associations with each other? Why do adult females live alone? Through observations on the costs and benefits of group living, Caro offers new insight into the complex behavior of this extraordinary species. For example, contrary to common belief about cooperative hunting in large carnivores, he shows that neither adolescents nor adult males benefit from hunting in groups. With many surprising findings, and through comparisons with other cat species, Caro enriches our understanding of the evolution of social behavior and offers new perspectives on conservation efforts to save this charismatic and endangered carnivore.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hcZCubO01bEC&dq=Cheetahs+of+the+Serengeti+Plains+:+Group+Living+in+an+Asocial+Species+(Wildlife+Behavior+and+Ecology+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Institutions and Local Empowerment: Competing Theoretical Perspectives (International Political Economy)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0_2yQgAACAAJ&dq=Global+Institutions+and+Local+Empowerment:+Competing+Theoretical+Perspectives+(International+Political+Economy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catholic Schools and the Common Good","description":"The authors examine a broad range of Catholic high schools to determine whether or not students are better educated in these schools than they are in public schools.

Writing in the 1920s, when anthropology was still young, Radin set out to show that  primitive  cultures are as intellectually sophisticated and venturesome as any of their  civilized  counterparts. The basic questions about the structure of the natural world, the nature of right and wrong, and the meaning of life and death, as well as basic methods of considering the truth or falsehood of the answers those questions give rise to, are, Radin argues, recognizably consistent across the whole range of human societies. He rejects both the romantic myth of the noble savage and the rationalist dismissal of the primitive mind as essentially undeveloped, averring that the anthropologist and the anthropologist s subject meet on the same philosophical ground, and only when that is acknowledged can anthropology begin in earnest. The argument is clearly and forcibly made in pages that also contain an extraordinary collection of poems, proverbs, myths, and tales from a host of different cultures, making Primitive Man as Philosopher not only a lasting contribution to the discipline of anthropology but a unique, rich, and fascinating anthology, one that both illuminates and enlarges our imagination of the human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bv1MBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Roman Empire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hguqzQEACAAJ&dq=Holy+Roman+Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mcgraw Hill Encyclopedia of Space","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bF7fsgEACAAJ&dq=Mcgraw+Hill+Encyclopedia+of+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Rock Sax - Techniques, Licks And Effects","description":"An invaluable text that gives the 'real world' saxophonist a practical way to learn technique and style.

The portraits therefore, so far as practicable, were inserted in the order of branch ages, beginning with the oldest, and located at regular intervals throughout the book. The Charts were inserted in the same order at the back of the book. Soon after the commencement it became apparent that the plan of ex tending this record to the descent of the female branches was too vast and exacting to be undertaken. It therefore was confined to the marriages and children only of the Goodspeed women. It was thought appropriate to exclude from the text proper all sketches of families connected by marriage with the Goodspeeds, but in the various footnotes to give such families suitable attention so far as the material therefor was furnished. This was done. As soon as sufficient interest shall have been manifested to warrant such a step, it is the intention to call the first general assembly of the Goodspeeds for the purpose of effecting an organization which thereafter, it is hoped, will be permanent, will hold annual meetings, will continue the publication of these records in the future, and will take any other steps that shall be in the interest of the family and agreeable to all.

Today, a new stage in the development of Hinduism in America is taking shape. After a century of experimentation during which Americans welcomed Indian gurus who adjusted their teachings to accommodate the New World context,  American Hinduism  can now rightly be called its own tradition rather than an imported religion. Accordingly, this spiritual path is now headed by leaders born in North America. Homegrown Gurus explores this phenomenon in essays about these figures and their networks. A variety of teachers and movements are considered, including Ram Dass, Siddha Yoga, and Amrit Desai and Kripalu Yoga, among others. Two contradictory trends quickly become apparent: an increasing Westernization of Hindu practices and values alongside a renewed interest in traditional forms of Hinduism. These opposed sensibilities innovation and preservation, radicalism and recovery are characteristic of postmodernity and denote a new chapter in the American assimilation of Hinduism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GHxhuLq9-O8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Microbiology (Fifth Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1DM1MwEACAAJ&dq=Fundamentals+of+Microbiology+(Fifth+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Goggle-eyed Pirates","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5RD_OQAACAAJ&dq=The+Goggle-eyed+Pirates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once Is Not Enough","description":"The spectacular bestseller from the author of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.

This book breaks the impasse by using pro-life premises to reach pro-choice conclusions. While it is commonly assumed that state protection of the fetus as a form of human life undermines women's reproductive rights, McDonagh instead illuminates how it is exactly such state protection of the fetus that strengthens, rather than weakens, not only women's right to an abortion, but even more significantly, women's ability to call on the state for abortion funding. McDonagh's approach, by bridging the divide between pro-life and pro-choice advocates, revolutionizes the abortion debate in a way that opens up a whole new avenue for resolving the abortion conflict and advancing women's rights. McDonagh reframes the abortion debate by locating the missing piece of the puzzle: the fetus as the cause of pregnancy. After exposing the myths on this subject, her exacting analysis presents the scientific and legal evidence that the ultimate source of pregnancy is the fetus. The central issue then becomes what the fetus, as an active agent, does to a woman's body during pregnancy, whether that pregnancy is wanted or not. McDonagh graphically describes the massive changes produced by the fetus when it takes over a woman's body. As such, pregnancy is best depicted not as a condition that women have a right to choose but rather as a condition to which they must have a right to consent. Abortion, therefore, does not rest on the intensely debated principle, stated in Roe, that women have a right to be free from state interference when choosing privately what to do with their own bodies. Instead, as McDonagh's book explains, abortion rights flow inevitably from women's more established right to consent to what another agent does to their body. Specifically, women have a right to resist an unwanted intrusion by a fetus as well as to receive help from the state to stop such an intrusion. Moving abortion rights from choice to consent has broad legal and cultural ramifications tapping into the very cornerstone of the American political system: consent. McDonagh unravels the consequences of extending to pregnant women the same guarantees of bodily integrity and liberty possessed by others in our society. Specifically, she shows why a woman who does not consent to be made pregnant by a fetus, not only has a right to terminate pregnancy, but why the state violates constitutional due process and equal protection guarantees when it fails to provide her with the same protections against nonconsensual intrusions by a fetus as it provides against nonconsensual intrusions by other parties. This book pivotally strengthens, therefore, not only women's right to abortion but also abortion funding. By providing new grounds both for the public funding of abortion and for the removal of government restrictions on abortions, it lays the foundation for enhancing women's rights through major policy changes in legislatures and courts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=btJWEoAAYNUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trust Matters: New Directions in Health Care Leadership","description":"New Directions in Health Care Leadership Building trust in the health care community is our greatest challenge for the next century.

With humor, intelligence, and his trademark writing style, he shows that relationship is God s way of leading us to redemption. And our need for redemption drives us to relationship with God.  Being a Christian,  Miller writes,  is more like falling in love than understanding a series of ideas.  Maybe you are a Christian wondering what faith you signed up for. Or maybe you don t believe anything and are daring someone anyone to show you a genuine example of authentic faith. Somewhere beyond the self-help formulas, fancy marketing, and easy promises there is a life-changing experience with God waiting. Searching for God Knows What weaves together beautiful stories and fresh perspectives on the Bible to show one man s journey to find it.  Like a shaken snow globe, Donald Miller s newest collection of essays creates a swirl of ideas about the Christian life that eventually crystallize into a lovely landscape . . .

While numerous commentators on contemporary political thought have acknowledged his considerable influence on the substance and direction of American conservatism, no analysis of his social and political writing has dealt extensively with the philosophical foundations of his work. In this provocative study, W. Wesley McDonald examines those foundations and demonstrates their impact on the conservative intellectual movement that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. Kirk played a pivotal role in drawing conservatism away from the laissez-faireprinciplesoflibertarianism and toward those of a traditional community grounded in a renewed appreciation of man's social and spiritual nature and the moral prerequisites of genuine liberty. In a humane social order, a community of spirit is fostered in which generations are bound together. According to Kirk, this link is achieved through moral and social norms that transcend the particularities of time and place and, because they form the basis of genuine civilized existence, can only be neglected at great peril. These norms, reflected in religious dogmas, traditions, humane letters, social habit and custom, and prescriptive institutions, create the sources of the true community that is the final end of politics. Although this study does not challenge Kirk's debts to a predominantly Catholic and Anglo-Catholic tradition of natural law, its focus is on his appeal to historical experience as the test of sound institutions. This aspect of his thought was essential to Kirk's understanding of moral, cultural, and aesthetic norms and can be seen in his responses to American humanists Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt and to English and American romantic literature.Russell Kirk and the Age of Ideology is particularly relevant because of the growing interest in Kirk's legacy and the current debate over the meaning of conservatism. McDonald addresses both of those developments in the context of examining Kirk's thought, attempting to correct some of the inadequacies contained in earlier studies that assess Kirk as a political thinker. This book will serve as a significant contribution to the commentary on this fascinating figure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L636Yzxb-pUC&dq=The+Sword+Of+Imagination:+Memoirs+Of+A+Half-Century+Of+Literary+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The secret language","description":"This book reveals what people have wanted to know about the human condition from the very beginning of time: What are feelings for?

Such places are always owned by men named Hans or Ernest and have splintery wooden floors which are swept an average of once every quarter of an hour. They smell very strongly of vinegar and have very little on display in the way of wares - on top of the glass display case, a large pickle jar, usually almost empty, inside the case a small piece of cheese, a small end of roast beef and a small end of ham, perhaps one knackwurst, a pint of salad, and some rye bread. In that part of the establishment referred to by Ernest or Hans as The Back is the beer, the soft drinks, the stove on which the coffee is made To Go. One winces at the small resources on or out of which Erny is obliged to sustain life, one goes on wincing for ten, twenty, thirty years, wondering if Erny is ever going to be able to make enough money to afford a large piece of roast beef, an entire ham, or a whole rye bread. And then one day Erny isn't there any more and one learns that he has retired and moved to Florida where, in partnership with his brother-in-law, a retired plumbing contractor from New Brunswick or Queens, he now owns and operates three motels, a liquor license, a restaurant, and an all-night grocery. Never again will one hear Erny's inimitable conversation, to wit: \\"What can I do for you?\\"... The odor of vinegar was very sharp. The man behind the counter had scant hair around his head and abundant flesh around his jaws. \\"You are the Grand Logothete\\", said Edward.

Based on Bowen family systems theory, Connecting with Our Children shows parents how to build the connection found in better relationships.

The author examines common concerns, such as: * How substance abuse can repeat through generations * Why fusions between family members drive conflict * How family anxiety can erupt into violence * Whether stepfamilies can create a new family unit * What roles faith and humor play in a family * How effective are special contributions made by connections with grandparents Numerous practical examples and stories illustrate familiar situations and concerns, so that parents can learn how to deal with the often confusing situations surrounding their children, as well as those within their own lives.

This is one of the most difficult problems of religious belief. Richard Swinburne gives a careful, clear examination of this problem, and offers an answer: it is because God wants more for us than just pleasure or freedom from suffering. Swinburne argues that God wants humans to learn and to love, to make the choices which make great differences for good and evil to each other, to form our characters in the way we choose; above all to be of great use to each other. If we are to have all this, there will inevitably be suffering for the short period of our lives on Earth. But because of the good that God gives to humans in this life, and because he makes it possible for us, through our choice, to share the life of Heaven, he does not wrong us if he allows suffering. Providence and the Problem of Evil is the final volume of Richard Swinburne's acclaimed tetralogy on Christian doctrine. It may be read on its own as a self-standing treatment of this eternal philosophical issue. Readers who are interested in a unified study of the philosophical foundations of Christian belief will find it now in the tetralogy and in his trilogy on the philosophy of theism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-tbnr3r3n2UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Searching for the Bright Path: The Mississippi Choctaws from Prehistory to Removal (Indians of the Southeast)","description":"Blending an engaging narrative style with broader theoretical considerations, James Taylor Carson offers the most complete history to date of the Mississippi Choctaws.

Despite changes in subsistence practices and material culture, the Choctaws made every effort to retain certain core cultural beliefs and sensibilities, a strategy they conceived of as following ?the straight bright path.?

Many of the Twentieth century's finest writers were brought to the movie-making centers -- especially Hollywood -- to adapt their own books into screenplays. More often, another writer or writers would be given the assignment of turning a book into a workable film script. Sometimes the result was a creative leap that expanded and illuminated the original work. Frequently, it wasn't. In the 60-plus essays collected in Books into Film, Robin H. Smiley explores the creative process that puts words together into a book, then translates those words into speech and image and action on film. Drawing upon his experience as a writer and screenwriter and a lifelong student and fan of the movies, the author thoughtfully considers a wide range of books -- from high comedy to darkest noir, from science fiction to melodrama -- and the films made from them.

Bushman A Biography and Filmography","description":"Before Burt Lancaster and Charlton Heston, before Bogart and Gable, even before Rudolph Valentino, there was Francis X. Bushman. Named the King of the Movies at San Francisco's Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915, Bushman virtually created the Hollywood model of the male heartthrob that hundreds of others have sought to imitate over the years. Born in 1883, Bushman had his first acting jobs in stock companies in his hometown of Baltimore. His film career started in 1911 when he starred in a one-reeler entitled His Friend's Wife. Over the next seven years, he became one of the top stars in movies. But his divorce from his wife, Josephine, and subsequent remarriage to leading lady, Beverly Bayne, effectively ended his career. He did manage a triumphant return to the big screen as Messala in Ben Hur (1926), but mostly thereafter he had smaller parts or was on stage. From contemporary sources and conversations with many of Bushman's surviving relatives, this is the compelling tale of one of Hollywood's first superstars and how his career laid the foundation for the matinee idols who followed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TKpZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Francis+X.+Bushman+A+Biography+and+Filmography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Cross: The Napoleon Kaufman Story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iYsHOAAACAAJ&dq=At+the+Cross:+The+Napoleon+Kaufman+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Women Who Lived for Danger: Behind Enemy Lines During WWII","description":"\\"They flirted with men, and with death.\\" In The Women Who Lived for Danger, acclaimed historian Marcus Binney recounts the story of ten remarkable women -- some famous, some virtually unknown -- recruited to work behind enemy lines as secret agents during WWII. Part of Winston Churchill's Special Operations Executive, formed in 1940 to \\"set Europe ablaze,\\" the women of the SOE were trained to handle guns and explosives, work undercover, endure interrogation by the Gestapo, and use complex codes. Once in enemy territory, theirs was the most dangerous war of all, leading an apparently normal civilian life but in constant danger of arrest and execution. Passing themselves off as country wenches by afternoon and chic Parisiennes by night, these women put service to Britain and the Allied forces above all concerns for personal safety -- they organized dropping grounds for arms and explosives destined for the Resistance, helped operate escape lines for airmen who had been shot down over Europe, and provided Allied Command with vital intelligence. The exploits of those chronicled in The Women Who Lived for Danger form a new chapter of heroism in the history of warfare matched only by their legacy of daring, determination, resourcefulness, and ability to stay cool in the face of extreme danger.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D-0ZunR0nL4C&dq=The+Women+Who+Lived+for+Danger:+Behind+Enemy+Lines+During+WWII&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mourning & Mitzvah: A Guided Journal for Walking the Mourner's Path Through Grief to Healing","description":"\\"If catastrophe is not representable according to the narrative explanations which would  make sense  of history, then making sense of ourselves and charting the future are not impossible.

The chapters not only review past research on conflict in some relationships, but also take a significant step forward in introducing a variety of other relationship types for future research on conflict. These chapters also offer evidence that conflict is experienced differently in different types of interpersonal relationships. The second part of this book describes basic underlying principles and programs for dealing with interpersonal conflicts. Chapters in this section discuss patterns of argument in everyday life, issues associated with competence in interpersonal conflict, and mediation as a form of intervention for resolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-AFeAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Niv Application Commentary : Revelation Hb (Niv Application Commentary S)","description":"Revelation, by any modern standard, is a strange book.

The Book of Revelation: The Rest of the Story demonstrates that the key to understanding the message of Revelation is found in this intricate relationship between the seven  letters  and the rest of the book, with the visions of Revelation 422 building on, fleshing out, and driving home each of the messages to the seven churches in Revelation 23. In the end, Revelation proves to be not primarily a guide to how things are going to unfold at the end of the age, but rather a profound call to a life of radical devotion to Jesus regardless of one s circumstances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UfI4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Using your meter: VOM and DVM multitesters","description":"Everything you need to maintain, troubleshoot, and repair all types of electronic equipment From cell phones to medical instruments to digital and microprocessor based equipment, this hands-on, heavily illustrated guide clearly explains how to troubleshoot, maintain, and repair all types of electrical equipment.

But how do we square this with the popular view that we can never truly comprehend the experience of being someone else? In this book, Samuel Fleischacker delves into the work of Adam Smith to draw out an understanding of empathy that respects both personal difference and shared humanity. After laying out a range of meanings for the concept of empathy, Fleischacker proposes that what Smith called \\"sympathy\\" is very much what we today consider empathy. Smith's version has remarkable value, as his empathy calls for entering into the perspective of another--a uniquely human feat that connects people while still allowing them to define their own distinctive standpoints. After discussing Smith's views in relation to more recent empirical and philosophical studies, Fleischacker shows how turning back to Smith promises to enrich, clarify, and advance our current debates about the meaning and uses of empathy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zyOyDwAAQBAJ&dq=Pursued+by+Evil+(Pursued+by+Evil+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Paper Chase","description":"Are you missing one of the most exhilarating and rewarding dimensions of the Christian life?

It developed from the indigenous martial arts of Ryukyu Islands (called te, literally \\"hand\\"; tii in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts, particularly Fujian White Crane. Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands, and palm-heel strikes. Historically and in some modern styles grappling, throws, joint locks, restraints, and vital point strikes are also taught. A karate practitioner is called a karateka.

The book has been endorsed by dozens of professionals in psychology, psychiatry, child development, pediatrics, obstetrics, childbirth education, sociology, and anthropology, including Ashley Montagu, Christiane Northrup, Warren Farrell, Sheila Kitzinger, Sam Keen, and Penelope Leach. Without much knowledge, the American public generally assumes that our cultural practice of circumcision is a trivial and benign procedure. Plain facts and research results conflict with these beliefs and raise serious questions. Dr. Goldman's application of psychological and social research coherently explains both the tenacity of the practice and the contradictory information and beliefs about it. After a review of the surprising abilities of infants and their responses to circumcision pain, the long-term psychological effects of circumcision are examined from the perspectives of both traditional and innovative psychological theories. We learn that circumcision has potential effects not only on men and sexuality, but also on mother-child relationships, male-female relationships, and societal traits and problems. The text is supported with clinical reports, interviews, surveys, and thorough documentation. CIRCUMCISION: THE HIDDEN TRAUMA identifies an overlooked source of early pain and points us in the direction of both healing and preventing this pain. It is of particular interest to men who seek to explore their sexuality and deepen self-awareness; women who want to understand men better; parents and children's advocates; childbirth educators and allied workers; and mental health, medical, and academic professionals. The book has wide appeal because, more generally, it is about trusting our instincts, questioning some of our cultural values and assumptions, and reflecting on who we are and who we can be as individuals and as a society. Ronald Goldman, Ph.D., is a psychologist, educator, and executive director of the Circumcision Resource Center in Boston (www.circumcision.org), a nonprofit educational organization. He gives lectures and seminars on the psychological and social aspects of circumcision and provides consultation to expectant parents and circumcised men. Dr. Goldman has been a featured guest on local and national radio and television shows and has been cited in numerous newspapers and periodicals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cXRsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Circumcision,+The+Hidden+Trauma+:+How+an+American+Cultural+Practice+Affects+Infants+and+Ultimately+Us+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandpa's book of rules: Rules and guidelines for raising your kids, your grandkids, and maybe your neighbor's kids","description":"Rules and guidelines for raising your kids, your grandkids, and maybe your neighbor's kids as responsible, caring, respectful, honest children growing up with integrity and values.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tgbGAAAACAAJ&dq=Grandpa%27s+book+of+rules:+Rules+and+guidelines+for+raising+your+kids,+your+grandkids,+and+maybe+your+neighbor%27s+kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy Astrology Guide: How to Read Your Horoscope","description":"Easy Astrology Guide gives the reader instant interpretations.

We also hear from the mad themselves. Legal and social distinctions faded as delusion and disorder took root   in convicts exiled from their homes and living under the weight of imperial justice, in ex-convicts and small settlers as they grappled with the country they had taken from its Indigenous inhabitants, and in government officers and wealthy colonists who sought to guide the course of European history in Australia.

Beginning with an early piece by Jacob Steendam (from when the city was called New Amsterdam) and continuing through poems written in the aftermath of 9/11, this anthology features voices from more than a dozen countries. It includes two Nobel Prize recipients, fifteen Pulitzer Prize winners, and many other recognizable names, but it also preserves the work of long-neglected poets who celebrate the wild possibilities and colossal achievements of this epic city. Poets capture New York's major moments and transformations, writing of Hudson's arrival, Stuyvesant's prejudice, and the city's astonishing growth and gentrification. They speak of the thrills of a skyscraper's observation deck and the privations of teeming tenements. They portray the immigrant experience at Ellis Island and the decay, fear, and unexpected kindness on a subway ride. They take place on sidewalks, bridges, and docks; in taxis, buses, and ferries; and even within nature. The Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, Broadway, the Statue of Liberty, and other familiar landmarks are recast through the prism of individual experience yet still reflect the seeming invincibility of New York and its status as a cultural magnet for the freethinking and experimental.

It is 1913. Elsa Pendleton travels from England to Easter Island with her husband, an anthropologist sent by the Royal Geographical Society to study the colossal moai statues, and her younger sister. What begins as familial duty for Elsa becomes a grand adventure; on Easter Island she discovers her true calling. But, out of contact with the outside world, she is unaware that World War I has been declared and that a German naval squadron, fleeing the British across the South Pacific, is heading toward the island she now considers home. Sixty years later, Dr. Greer Farraday, an American botanist, travels to Easter Island to research the island s ancient pollen, but more important, to put back the pieces of her life after the death of her husband. A series of brilliant revelations brings to life the parallel quests of these two intrepid young women as they delve into the centuries-old mysteries of Easter Island. Slowly unearthing the island s haunting past, they are forced to confront turbulent discoveries about themselves and the people they love, changing their lives forever. Easter Island is a tour de force of storytelling that will establish Jennifer Vanderbes as one of the most gifted writers of her generation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4trrOOfU6AMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Binghamton Blues","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GnCrmgEACAAJ&dq=The+Binghamton+Blues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The imperialist,","description":"Sara Jeannette Duncan s classic portrait of a turn-of-the-century Ontario town, The Imperialist captures the spirit of an emergent nation through the example of two young dreamers. Impassioned by  the Imperialist idea,  Lorne Murchison rests his bid for office on his vision of a rejuvenated British Empire. His sister Advena betrays a kindred attraction to the high-flown ideals in her love for an unworldly, and unavailable, young minister. Nimbly alternating between politics and romance, Duncan constructs a superbly ironic object-lesson in the Canadian virtue of compromise. Sympathetic, humorous, and wonderfully detailed, The Imperialist is an astute analysis of the paradoxes of Canadian nationhood, as relevant today as when the novel was first published in 1904.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y_F6vFxj84QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Workbook in Spanish First Year (Primer Libro)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QJNLAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music Publishing 101 Crash Course: Made Simple & Easy (Updated Edition)","description":"The revised edition of this clear and concise course provides readers with a basic understanding of music publishing set forth in a completely non-intimidating fashion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OWIrhjmy3tMC&dq=Music+Publishing+101+Crash+Course:+Made+Simple&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are You in the House Alone","description":"An updated look for the classic YA thriller from genre heavyweight Richard Peck Sixteen-year-old Gail is living the upper-class suburban life when she begins receiving terrifying phone calls and notes in her locker.

Their smash hits \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" virtually invented the era's signature pulsating psychedelic music and, during one of the most tumultuous times in American history, came to personify the decade's radical counterculture. In this groundbreaking biography of the band, veteran music writer and historian Jeff Tamarkin produces a portrait of the band like none that has come before it. Having worked closely with Jefferson Airplane for more than a decade, Tamarkin had unprecedented access to the band members, their families, friends, lovers, crew members, fellow musicians, cultural luminaries, even the highest-ranking politicians of the time. More than just a definitive history, Got a Revolution! is a rock legend unto itself. Jann Wenner, editor-in-chief and publisher of Rolling Stone, wrote, \\"The classic [Jefferson] Airplane lineup were both architects and messengers of a psychedelic age, a liberation of mind and body that profoundly changed American art, politics, and spirituality. It was a renaissance that could only have been born in San Francisco, and the Airplane, more than any other band in town, spread the good news nationwide.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zl-RtAEACAAJ&dq=Got+a+Revolution!+:+The+Turbulent+Flight+of+Jefferson+Airplane&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cracking the AP Biology Exam, 2006-2007 Edition (College Test Preparation)","description":"Provides information on more than three hundred undergraduate majors, including related fields, sample college curricula, suggested high school preparation courses, and career and salary prospects for graduates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l3p15V-ZKYUC&dq=Cracking+the+AP+Biology+Exam,+2006-2007+Edition+(College+Test+Preparation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stolen for Profit: How the Medical Establishment Is Funding a National Pet-Theft Conspiracy","description":"An expose of pets stolen for experimentation in laboratories, the USDA's negligence to enforce statutes, and the fight of frontliners to combat pet thefts","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NjF4QgAACAAJ&dq=Stolen+for+Profit:+How+the+Medical+Establishment+Is+Funding+a+National+Pet-Theft+Conspiracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cemented Tungsten Carbides: Production, Properties and Testing (Materials Science and Process Technology)","description":"Written by an international expert, this book covers the processing, microstructure, and properties of cemented tungsten carbides.

As a result, passionate, faithful and bright individuals, from Eve to Ruth to Mary Magdalene, have lost meaning for many contemporary Christians and non-Christians alike. Here, through storytelling and artwork, twelve compelling women of the Bible invite readers to step further into the sacred circle of God s people, deepening their faith and joy in all of creation. That circle offers more than peace. It offers health, healing, and the knowledge that other women have also trod broken and jagged paths in their search for wholeness. By taking this step, the reader will discover that challenges experienced by biblical women are not so different from her own, including infertility, warfare, hunger, old age, grief and sexual conflict.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GmM9DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Materials Science and Technology: A Comprehensive Treatment, Vol. 12, Structure and Properties of Polymers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wOZqvwEACAAJ&dq=Materials+Science+and+Technology:+A+Comprehensive+Treatment,+Vol.+12,+Structure+and+Properties+of+Polymers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden remedy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NSXZ2zzxr78C&dq=Golden+remedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ottomans: Dissolving Images","description":"The world's last day - the fall of the Byzantine empire; at the gate of bliss - the shaping of Ottoman power; strangled with a silken cord - the constraints of Ottomanism; \\"The auspicious event\\"--The extirpation of the Janissaries; Stamboul, the city - Western images of the Ottomans; dreams from the rose pavilion - the meandering path of reform; \\"the lustful turk\\" \\"the terrible turk.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y60TAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Ottomans:+Dissolving+Images&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strolling Through Athens: Fourteen Unforgettable Walks through Europe's Oldest City","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Xsa_zQEACAAJ&dq=Strolling+Through+Athens:+Fourteen+Unforgettable+Walks+through+Europe%27s+Oldest+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laundry and Bourbon","description":"THE STORY: The setting is the front porch of Roy and Elizabeth's home in Maynard, Texas, on a hot summer afternoon.

Until now, however, no introductory treatment has presented the subject in a form that was quantitatively explicit and yet easy to follow. Designed as an introduction to undergraduate and graduate students new to the subject, and as a refresher for professionals seeking to broaden their command, Hunter-Gatherer Foraging: Five Simple Models presents the five foraging models that lend themselves best to hunter-gatherer application: diet breadth, linear programming, front- versus back-loaded resources, technological investment, and field processing. Each chapter begins with a hypothetical hunter-gatherer problem and takes the reader through the steps needed to state such problems in quantitative form and solve them. Exercises (with answers) at the end of each chapter reinforce key concepts and methodology. From the reviews . . . \\"[A] fine volume that does just what it claims to. The style is informal, often humorous, and it will clearly work well in a classroom of advanced undergraduates or graduate students.

[A]nyone with a serious interest in hunter-gatherers, prehistoric subsistence, and resource provisioning will want to own a copy.\\" Mark E. Basgall in Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology \\"This book is the first of its kind to provide a suite of tools applicable to many ethnographic and archaeological foraging problems.

Classics such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Philadelphia Story, Harvey, and, of course, It s A Wonderful Life are far more than mere movies; they are visions of America as it wanted to be seen. With his inimitable (though widely mimicked) down-home drawl, Jimmy Stewart came to embody the ideal American male, lean, affably sarcastic, honorable, endearingly awkward. His double takes were memorable; his way of muttering his asides charmed audiences. Most of all, he was the man whose heart was always in the right place, and who would see always see his way clear to doing the right thing.  If Bess and I had a son,  Harry Truman once said,  we d want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart.  Jonathon Coe traces Stewart s beginnings in a small town in Pennsylvania, his amateur dramatics and college years at Princeton, and the early films and stardom through to his heroics as an air force pilot during World War II and his triumphant return to Hollywood. Though he was adored in black and white, Stewart s mature work shows his range as an actor, his ability to play far more than just the good-natured leading man. By the time he retired from acting, Stewart had films credits that were unparalleled and a place in the American heart that was unrivaled. Illustrated with 150 photographs, taken on and off the set, this handsome tribute gives us the private man as well as the screen legend and guides us through the whole wonderful life of Jimmy Stewart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2TyCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entre Amis: An Interactive Approach (French Edition)","description":"The seamless articulation of vocabulary, grammar, activities and cultural content is what makes ENTRE AMIS so effective in the classroom!

Whereas Indicators of Social Change was concerned with various kinds of \\"hard\\" data, typically sociostructural, this book is devoted chiefly to so-called \\"softer\\" data of a more social-psychological sort: the attitudes, expectations, aspirations, and values of the American population. The book deals with the meaning of change from two points of view. First, it is interested in the human meaning which people attribute to the complex social environment in which they find themselves; their understanding of group relations, the political process, and the consumer economy in which they participate. Secondly, it discusses the impact that the various alternatives offered by the environment have on the nature of their lives and the fulfillment of those lives. The twelve essays which make up the volume deal successively with the major domains of life. Each author sets forth an inclusive statement of the most significant dimensions of psychological change in a specific area of life, to review the state of present information, and to project the measurements needed to improve understanding of these changes in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HHE24WbiIjcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terra papagalli (Portuguese Edition)","description":"The Indian Ocean World was an idea borne out by researchers in economic history and trade in the 1980s in response to the compartmentalization of specific area studies within the wider rubric of Asian civilisations and culture. Professor Kirti N. Chaudhuri s books Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company (1978), and then Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean (1985), figured amongst the forefront of this new movement in historical thinking, undertaking detailed historical analysis, first of the English East India Company, and then a comparative cultural history of Asian material life and civilisation. Today, historians continue to hold on to the idea of an Indian Ocean world, although studies now follow a number of different threads, from themes like linguistics and creolization, to the seeds of national consciousness. By presenting a number of studies here, gathered into the themes of  Intermixing,   The World of Trade  and  Colonial Paths,  it is hoped we can render tribute to one of the outstanding historians in this field and reflect the plenitude of current research in this subject area.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TgUrBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real 12 Days of Christmas: The Story Behind the Song","description":"Tells the story behind the popular English folk song, which was used to teach children Christian doctrine during times of religious persecution in sixteenth-century England","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JPimuQAACAAJ&dq=The+Real+12+Days+of+Christmas:+The+Story+Behind+the+Song&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lion King: Rhythm of the Pride Lands","description":"In its 114th year, Billboard remains the world's premier weekly music publication and a diverse digital, events, brand, content and data licensing platform.

It is a unique work which does not have serious rivals in the biblical-creationist book market. The lack of a good and comprehensive introductory book was the main reason why I started to write the book in the first place. I have made use of the best available scholarly literature, Christian as well as secular. The book contains a lot of my own research, but it is also in very good agreement with the archaeological articles written by A. J. M. Osgood (can be read at creation.com) and the books of David Down (Unwrapping the Pharaohs and Unveiling the Kings of Israel), for example. FFFK follows the absolute chronology of Floyd Nolen Jones' The Chronology of the Old Testament. As a Bible-faithful narrative introduction to the history and archaeology of the ancient Near East, From Flood to Fallen Kingdoms is far better than the existing apologetic works that come towards the genre of FFFK (Evidence for the Bible by Clive Anderson and Brian Edwards; Ancient Post-Flood History by Ken Johnson; The World's Story 1: The Ancients by Angela O'Dell, for example). From Flood to Fallen Kingdoms will strengthen the faith of numerous believing readers who take the Holy Scriptures seriously. They will also be surprised to see how well the first five post-flood centuries, from Ararat to Abraham, which until now have been in great darkness, can be elucidated through proper interpretation of biblical and archaeological evidence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fU3zDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Destination Known (Pitt Drue Heinz Lit Prize)","description":"Winner of the 2001 Drue Heinz Literature Prize for short fiction, these stories explore the detours, potholes, and speed bumps along the road of life and the struggle to get behind the wheel and take control.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XldaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Destination+Known+(Pitt+Drue+Heinz+Lit+Prize)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forgiveness and Inner Healing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=K-rAYgEACAAJ&dq=Forgiveness+and+Inner+Healing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surface Processes and Landforms (2nd Edition)","description":"This book includes both basic material for students without a great deal of background in geology as well as more advanced topics.With coverage that reaches beyond the study of surface processes, it contains discussions on the evolution of landforms and interpretation of their origin.

Stolley, Pushcart-nominated author of Your Own Personal Project and Other Stories In Blood & Shadows, Eric Baine had to stop a psychopathic vampire bent on releasing shadow demons to destroy the world... In The Raven's Song, he's the prey instead, as two beautiful assassins stalk Baine to track down his friend, the assassin-without-peer Azrael, the Eternal Death. But nothing is as it seems, and as Baine works to stay alive (relatively speaking) and begins to unravel the plot, it seems that everyone involved is being played as pawns in a deeper game... From The Raven's Song: Chained to a chair in my own offce, with a bag over my head. Not a good way to start the day. A voice said, \\"Mr. Baine.\\" A deep, sultry female voice. A voice tinged with amusement, sensuality, and overwhelmingly with barely contained violence. I detected the slightest hint of an unidentifiable accent. I heard the sound of a lighter being flicked, and a moment later I caught the faintest whiff of cigarette smoke. \\"Speak when you're told to speak,\\" said the voice. \\"Okey-dokey,\\" I said, smiling. Another blow upside the head. I continued smiling. For five minutes the only sound in my office was the occasional inhale and exhale of the cigarette. I presumed she was waiting for me to develop some degree of anxiety. People tend to underestimate me, especially vampire people; they don't know me well enough. During those rare times when I'm chained to a chair by an unknown stalker, this can be comforting. So whether she was waiting for me to betray some emotion, or just trying to get me scared way deep down inside, the only thing I was feeling was a mild curiosity. I had her right where I wanted her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=97Sw-cP4FbwC&dq=The+Raven%27s+Song:+From+the+Files+of+Eric+Baine,+the+Dead+Detective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's political dynasties","description":"America's political families, from the Adams to the Bushes and the Clintons America was founded in rebellion against nobility and inherited status. Yet from the start, dynastic families have been conspicuous in national politics. The Adamses. The Lodges. The Tafts. The Roosevelts. The Kennedys. And today the Bushes and the Clintons. In this thoroughly revised and updated edition of his bestselling work, longtime presidential historian Stephen Hess offers an encyclopedic tour of the families that have loomed large over America's political history. Starting with John Adams, who served as the young nation's first vice president and earned the nickname \\"His Rotundity,\\" Hess paints the portraits of the men and women who, by coincidence, connivance, or sheer sense of duty, have made up America's political elite. There are the well-known dynasties such as the Roosevelts and the Kennedys, and the names that live on only in history books, such as the Bayards (six generations of U.S. senators) and the Breckinridges (a vice president, two senators, and six representatives). Hess fills the pages of America's Political Dynasties with anecdotes and personality-filled stories of the families who have given the United States more than a fair share of its presidents, senators, governors, ambassadors, and cabinet members. This new edition also tells us the stories of the Bushes and what looks to be a political dynasty in waiting, the Clintons. And emblematic of America's growing diversity, Hess examines how women, along with ethnic and racial minorities, have joined the ranks of dynastic political families. The Constitution states that \\"no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.\\" Yet, as Stephen Hess has written, it seems political nobility is as American as apple pie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_fV5rgEACAAJ&dq=America%27s+political+dynasties&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When a Butterfly Sneezes: A Guide for Helping Kids Explore Interconnections in Our World Through Favorite Stories (Systems Thinking for Kids, Big and Small, Vol 1)","description":"\\"More and more educators and businesspeople espouse system thinking today---this short workbook helps you do it!

Little House in the Big Woods Wolves and panthers and bears roam the deep Wisconsin woods in the late 1870's. In those same woods, Laura lives with Pa and Ma, and her sisters, Mary and Baby Carrie, in a snug little house built of logs. Pa hunts and traps. Ma makes her own cheese and butter. All night long, the wind howls lonesomely, but Pa plays the fiddle and sings, keeping the family safe and cozy. Little House on the Prairie Pa Ingalls decides to sell the little log house, and the family sets out for Indian country! They travel from Wisconsin to Kansas, and there, finally, Pa builds their little house on the prairie. Sometimes farm life is difficult, even dangerous, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie. Farmer Boy While Laura Ingalls grows up in a little house on the western prairie, Almanzo Wilder is living on a big farm in New York State. Almanzo and his brother and sisters work at their chores from dawn to supper most days -- no matter what the weather. There is still time for fun, though, especially with the horses, which Almanzo loves more than anything. On the Banks of Plum Creek Laura's family's first home in Minnesota is made of sod, but Pa builds a clean new house made of sawed lumber beside Plum Creek. The money for materials will come from their first wheat crop. Then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Soon millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm. In a week's time, there is no wheat crop left at all. By the Shores of Silver Lake Pa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. And Pa begins work on the first building in what will soon be a brand-new town on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long Winter The first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. Snow has reached the rooftops, and no trains can get through with food or coal. The people of De Smet are starving, including Laura's family, who wonder how they're going to make it through this terrible winter. It is young Almanzo Wilder who finally understands what needs to be done. He must save the town, even if it means risking his own life. Little Town on the Prairie The long winter is over. With spring come socials, parties, and \\"Literaries.\\" There is also work to be done. Laura spends many hours each day sewing shirts to help send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder. These Happy Golden Years Laura is teaching school, and it's terrifying! Most of the students are taller than she is, and she must sleep away from home for the first time. Laura is miserable, but the money is needed to keep Mary in a college for the blind. And every Friday -- no matter what the weather -- Almanzo Wilder arrives to take Laura home to her family for the weekend. Laura and Almanzo are courting, and even though she's not yet sixteen, she knows that this is a time for new beginnings. The First Four Years Laura and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! Their life on a small prairie homestead begins with high hopes. But each year seems to bring unexpected disasters -- storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. Always, though, there is love, especially for the newest member of the family -- baby Rose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OwhdvgAACAAJ&dq=Going+West+(My+First+Little+House)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imagining Indians in the Southwest: Persistent Visions of a Primitive,","description":"In Imagining Indians in the Southwest, Leah Dilworth examines the creation and enduring potency of the early twentieth-century myth of the primitive Indian. She shows how visions of Indians - created not only by tourism but also by anthropologists, collectors of Indian crafts, and modernist writers - have reflected white anxieties about such issues as the value of labor in an industrialized society, racial assimilation, and the perceived loss of cultural authenticity. Dilworth explores diverse expressions of mainstream society's primitivist impulse - from the Fred Harvey Company's guided tours of Indian pueblos supposedly untouched by modern life to enthnographic descriptions of the Hopi Snake dance as alien and exotic. She shows how magazines touted the preindustrial simplicity of Indian artisanal occupations and how Mary Austin's 1923 book, The American Rhythm, urged poets to emulate the cadences of Native American song and dance. Contending that Native Americans of the Southwest still are seen primarily as living relics, Dilworth describes the ways in which they have resisted cultural colonialism. She concludes with a consideration of two contemporary artists who, by infusing their works with history and complexity, are recasting the practices and politics of primitivism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O3g-PgAACAAJ&dq=Imagining+Indians+in+the+Southwest:+Persistent+Visions+of+a+Primitive,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Marchetti Bachelor (Harlequin Romance)","description":"After attending the Marchetti family s wedding, attorney Madison ends up spending the night with the youngest Marchetti brother, Luke.

While several Jewish journalists and scholars have produced largely admiring books describing the Lubavitch way of life and that group's outreach efforts to unaffiliated Jews, very little has been written about the many other Hasidic sects in the United States. Unlike Lubavitchers, members of these other groups are raised to avoid all unnecessary contact with outside society, including contact with other Jews. Winston's access was all but unprecedented. As a nonobservant Jew with little prior exposure to the Hasidic world, she never could have guessed what would happen next-that she would be introduced, slowly and covertly, to Hasidim from Satmar and other sects who were deeply unhappy with their highly restrictive way of life and sometimes desperately struggling to leave their communities. First there was Yossi, a young man who, though deeply attached to the Hasidic culture in which he was raised, longed for a life with fewer restrictions and more tolerance. Yossi's efforts at making such a life, however, were being severely hampered by his fourth grade English and math skills, his profound ignorance of the ways of the outside world, and the looming threat that pursuing his desires would almost certainly lead to rejection by his family and friends. Then she met Dini, a young wife and mother whose decision to deviate even slightly from Hasidic standards of modesty led to threatening phone calls from anonymous men, warning her that she needed to watch the way she was dressing if she wanted to remain a part of the community. Someone else introduced Winston to Steinmetz, a closet bibliophile worked in a small Judaica store in his community and spent his days off anxiously evading discovery in the library of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary, whose shelves contain non-Hasidic books he is forbidden to read but nonetheless devours, often several at a sitting. There were others still who had actually made the wrenching decision to leave their communities altogether. Already called a \\"must read\\" by Hasidic blogger \\"Shtreimel,\\" Unchosen tells the fascinating stories of these and other rebel Hasidim, serious questioners who long for greater personal and intellectual freedom than their communities allow. In so doing, Unchosen forces us to reexamine the history of these communities and asks us to consider what we choose not to see when we romanticize them.

In Trust, a penetrating assessment of the emerging global economic order \\"after History,\\" he explains the social principles of economic life and tells us what we need to know to win the coming struggle for world dominance. Challenging orthodoxies of both the left and right, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures in order to divine the underlying principles that foster social and economic prosperity. Insisting that we cannot divorce economic life from cultural life, he contends that in an era when social capital may be as important as physical capital, only those societies with a high degree of social trust will be able to create the flexible, large-scale business organizations that are needed to compete in the new global economy. A brilliant study of the interconnectedness of economic life with cultural life, Trust is also an essential antidote to the increasing drift of American culture into extreme forms of individualism, which, if unchecked, will have dire consequences for the nation's economic health.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Di_NMC0cAccC&dq=Trust:+The+Social+Virtues+and+The+Creation+of+Prosperity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American practical navigator : an epitome of navigation (SuDoc D 5.317:9/995)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright and Japan: The Role of Traditional Japanese Art and Architecture in the Work of Frank Lloyd Wright","description":"Looks at Wright's formal and philosophical debt to Japanese art and architecture.

How do I know God hears my prayers? How can I 'pray always, ' as Jesus commands? Why must I ask for things God already knows I need? Such were the questions that perplexed a young North African man, Augustine Aurelius (354-430), whose intense yearning for God led him into a profound and lifelong encounter with Christ in prayer. There Augustine found answers to these questions and to countless more answers not grounded in his own brilliance, but in prayer itself. In time, Augustine became a bishop and a Father of the Church, and has long been numbered among her saints. Yet of all the Church's saints, not one expresses the longing for God more beautifully, or explores the nature of prayer more helpfully, than St. Augustine. His words speak to us today as freshly as they did to his contemporaries. St. Augustine wrote many books, but never one devoted to prayer alone. Indeed, his teachings on prayer are scattered in many places. So from over 200 works, Fr. Cliff Ermatinger has gathered and translated Augustine's teachings on prayer, and now presents them here in a simple question-and-answer format. What emerges is nothing less than a rich new \\"catechism on prayer\\" by one of the Church's greatest saints.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bbukAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic of trees and stones.

In his preface to this new edition he reviews the developments over the past thirty ears, in archeology, in historical and philological work, and in urban planning and architectural trends that make The Idea of a Town timely once again; a reminder that recognizable patterns and texture, public open space, and conspicuous institutions can enrich the late twentieth-century city which has become preoccupied with the isolated architectural object, with physical and market forces. Rykwert focuses on the Roman town as a work of art, a symbolic pattern deliberately created and enjoyed by its inhabitants - its shape and the structure of the spaces constructed on the basis of beliefs and rituals. His starting point is the ancient texts: mythical, historical, and ritual in which city-foundations are told and played out, and in particular the \\"Etruscan rite,\\" a group of ceremonies which regulated the creation of practically all Roman towns. The principal institutions of the town, its walls and gates, its central shrines, and its public spaces, were all part of a pattern to which the myths which accompanied them provide clues. As in the other \\"closed\\" societies Rykwert investigates and compares throughout the book, these rituals and myths served to create a secure home for Roman citizens, placing them firmly in a knowable universe. Joseph Rykwert is Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq78Ff2TYHAC&dq=The+idea+of+a+town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival: Jamestown; First English Colony in America","description":"In December of 1606, a group of 150 men embarked from England to begin a settlement in Virginia, where one English colony had already perished. \\"Under the leadership of Captain John Smith these men would face the rigors of nature, violent rivalries among themselves and the ever present threat of the powerful Indian tribes of the region.\\" Pbulisher's note.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t7_TNAAACAAJ&dq=Survival:+Jamestown%3B+First+English+Colony+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raccoons: In Folklore, History and Today's Backyards","description":"Presents facts and lore about raccoons, drawn from Indian legends, current scientific findings, and face-to-face encounters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TtlFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Raccoons:+In+Folklore,+History+and+Today%27s+Backyards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary","description":"By Any Means Necessary is one of Malcolm X's most well known and remembered speeches.

Their wide-ranging discussions take place over the course of a year, beginning in July 2004. Set against the backdrop of George W. Bush's re-election campaign and the war in Iraq, each considers what it means to live in America today. John asks his father to look back to World War II, and explore the parallels that can and cannot be drawn between that time and our current post-9/11 consciousness. As their conversations develop, the topics shift from the political to the personal to the political again, as they duck and weave around one another. They explore their shared admiration of boxing and poker, the nature of marriage and love, television, movies, writing, and what it means to be a part of this extraordinary family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9oBpswEACAAJ&dq=The+Big+Empty:+Dialogues+on+Politics,+Sex,+God,+Boxing,+Morality,+Myth,+Poker+and+Bad+Conscience+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keeper of the House","description":"A  beautifully written  Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about prejudice and a distinguished family s secrets in the American South (The Atlantic Monthly). Seven generations of the Howland family have lived in the Alabama plantation home built by an ancestor who fought for Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812. Over the course of a century, the Howlands accumulated a fortune, fought for secession, and helped rebuild the South, establishing themselves as one of the most respected families in the state. But that history means little to Abigail Howland. The inheritor of the Howland manse, Abigail hides the long-buried secret of her grandfather s thirty-year relationship with his African American mistress. Her fortunes reverse when her family s mixed-race heritage comes to light and her community locked in the prejudices of the 1960s turns its back on her. Faced with such deep-seated racism, Abigail is pushed to defend her family at all costs. A  novel of real magnitude,  The Keepers of the House is an unforgettable story of family, tradition, and racial injustice set against the richly drawn backdrop of the American South (Kirkus Reviews). This ebook features an illustrated biography of Shirley Ann Grau, including rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the author s personal collection.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E2Te_bosjlsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behaviorism (Interpretations)","description":"Intentional behaviorism is a philosophy of psychology that seeks to ascertain the place and nature of cognitive explanation of behavior by empirically determining the scope of an extensional account of behavior based on the limitations of a behavioral approach to explanation. This book draws on an empirical program of research in economic psychology to establish a route to a reliable and justifiable intentional explanation of behavior. Since the cognitive revolution in psychology, intentional explanations of behavior have become the norm, and as the methodology that provides the normal science component of psychology, cognitivism is sometimes accepted relatively uncritically. However, there is a lack of understanding of the role of psychological research in determining the place and shape of intentionality. This book explicates the philosophy of psychology that the author has devised and applied in his work on economic psychology and behavioral economics. Given the provenance of intentional behaviorism, economic and consumer psychology forms the primary application basis for the book. This book provides a theoretical background to understanding how and why consumers make the choices they do. The book integrates behavioral economics, consumer psychology, and decision-making research to explore intentional behaviorism, which is proposed as a philosophical framework for consumer psychology, viewing economic behavior in the contexts of modern human consumers in affluent marketing-oriented societies. Integrates research in behavioral economics, decision-making, cognitive psychology, and consumer psychology. Offers readers an interdisciplinary look at intentionality and intentional explanations. Proposes a theory of intentional behaviorism to explain economic behavior, consumer choice, and other decision-making. Examines the methodologies of philosophers of mind such as Dennett and Searle.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K2LcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business As a Vocation: The Autobiography of Wu Ho-su (East Asian legal studies program, Harvard Law School)","description":"Wu Ho-Su (1919-1986) pioneered business ventures ranging from cloth and synthetic fiber industries to department stores and life insurance. This son of a crippled former coolie began as a laborer for a Japanese cloth-importing company in the 1930s, but eventually became a manager and then an independent entrepreneur. Overcoming business obstacles in Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist-ruled Taiwan after 1945, Mr. Wu painstakingly built Shinkong into Taiwan's sixth-largest business enterprise by the 1980s. This account of Wu Ho-Su's life, developed by Mr. Wu working directly with Dr. Huang Chin-shingm of the Academia Sinica, one of Taiwan's most distinguished historians, is instructive for the lessons it offers about both business practices in East Asia and their interplay with Confucian values. The book recounts with graphic examples the changing role of family and other networks in Taiwan's economic \\"miracle\\" and in the region more generally. The blend that Mr. Wu evidenced of business acumen and concern for Confucianism, in turn, raises broader questions of the type that scholars and businesspeople have strenuously debated since the time of Max Weber about the compatibility of Confucian norms and modern business practices.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dKCwAAAAIAAJ&dq=Business+As+a+Vocation:+The+Autobiography+of+Wu+Ho-su+(East+Asian+legal+studies+program,+Harvard+Law+School)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Babies and bombers.(Books)(Book Review): An article from: Policy Review","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BlcvAQAAIAAJ&dq=Babies+and+bombers.(Books)(Book+Review):+An+article+from:+Policy+Review&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beloved","description":"The real 'work' of prayer is to become silent and listen to the voice that says good things about me.

The books are designed for students of linguistics and those who are studying language as part of a wider course. Cognitive Linguistics explores the idea that language reflects our experience of the world. It shows that our ability to use language is closely related to other cognitive abilities such as categorization, perception, memory and attention allocation. Concepts and mental images expressed and evoked by linguistic means are linked by conceptual metaphors and metonymies and merged into more comprehensive cognitive and cultural models, frames or scenarios. It is only against this background that human communication makes sense. After 25 years of intensive research, cognitive-linguistic thinking now holds a firm place both in the wider linguistic and the cognitive-science communities. An Introduction to Cognitive Linguistics carefully explains the central concepts of categoriza?-tion, of prototype and gestalt perception, of basic level and conceptual hierarchies, of figure and ground, and of metaphor and metonymy, for which an innovative description is provided.

How does leadership happen when there are many leaders trying to reach a goal and no clear followers? And what does leadership look like when no one person is in charge? In The Deep Blue Sea, Wilfred Drath responds to these challenges by presenting a new leadership framework called \\"relational leadership.\\" His revolutionary approach recasts the idea of leadership as a group function that results in self-organized entities. Using the story of a fictional piano company, Drath helps us understand why this new notion of leadership is needed to face the challenges of the 21st century.

To all of those dental patients whose whine rises in tandem with that of the drill, take note: You would do well to stifle your terror and instead offer thanks to Apollonia, the patron saint of toothache sufferers, that you face only fleeting discomfort rather than the disfiguring distress, or slow agonizing death oft meted out by dental-care providers of the past. The transition from yesterday's ignorance, misapprehension, and superstition to the enlightened and nerve-deadened protocols of today has been a long, slow, and very painful process. For example, did you know that: *Among the toothache remedies favored by Pierre Fauchard, the father of dentistry, was rinsing the mouth liberally with one's own urine. *George Washington never had wooden teeth. However, his chronic dental problems may have impacted the outcome of the American Revolution. *Soldiers in the Civil War needed at least two opposing front teeth to rip open powder envelopes. Some men called up for induction had their front teeth extracted to avoid service. *Teeth were harvested from as many as fifty thousand corpses after the Battle of Waterloo, a huge crop later used for dentures and transplants that became known as \\"Waterloo Teeth.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ek7ABQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halfhyde to the Narrows (The Halfhyde Adventures, No. 4)","description":"With a ship to call his own at last, Royal Navy Lieutenant St Vincent Halfhyde sails for the Dardanelles in command of the little torpedo-boat Vendetta, part of a flotilla sent to rescue a Britsih sailing-ship unlawfully detained by the Russians.

Harley-Davidson is among the oldest surviving motorcycle manufacturers; the company began in 1903 and continues to this day. As you can imagine, over the course of more than 100 years, the company has seen prosperous times as well as lean times, changes in focus and direction, evolution and revolution. All of that leads to a lot of company history and trivia. American Iron Magazine associate editor Tyler Greenblatt has compiled 1,001 Harley-Davidson facts into this single volume, with subjects ranging from the historic powertrains to pop culture to Harley-Davidson as a company and manufacturer. Facts begin with the early years, when a motorcycle was not much more than a bicycle with an engine attached, to the war efforts of World War I, when 15,000 were put into service. During the 1920s, Harley-Davidson grew into the largest manufacturer in the world, and that momentum helped carry it through the Great Depression and into World War II. Postwar development and AMF ownership are also covered in detail, as well as the restructuring and revival of the brand in recent years. Whether you're a casual rider, racer, or restorer, Harley-Davidson enthusiasts will be sure to find something in this book for that next conversation with fellow hobbyists. This book will keep Harley-Davidson enthusiasts entertained for hours, and is a great edition to any motorcycling library. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Arial}","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H_YWDgAAQBAJ&dq=Harley-Davidson:+Design+and+Development:1903-To+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"K'tonton in Israel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_D_6PAAACAAJ&dq=K%27tonton+in+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friends and Relations","description":"Two sisters, two weddings, just months apart.

The towering triumph of the Lewis and Clark expedition is due in no small part to the skill and fortitude of such men as Sgt. Charles Floyd, the only expedition member to die; Sgt.

A car full of teens, running from a stop by Deputy Torrez, goes air-borne into a rocky outcrop, killing all five kids and revealing a package of cocaine under the seat. Has someone brought big-time crime to the county? Bill is now dealing with grieving parents - one of whom starts packing a gun. Then a second explosion of violence fells an undercover cop.

Montgomery Director of Gift Planning University of Washington \\"The Art of Planned Giving sets forth a compelling argument for bringing a broader perspective to the pursuit of planned gifts encouraging us to balance technical knowledge and skills with a deeper understanding of what truly promotes philanthropy.\\"  C.

Rick, Director of Planned Giving and Charitable Gift Counsel The Sierra Club \\"Doug's discussion implicitly educates the reader on technical gift structures, but keeps the focus where it belongs: on the rewards of practicing philanthropy.\\"  Nancy Herrold Strapp, JD Director of Planned Giving Children's Hospital Foundation \\"The Art of Planned Giving is about doing planned giving right: understanding donors as human beings; understanding the many factors that cause people to emotionally connect with a charity's mission; appreciating their life experiences and how these experiences impact their motive to give; understanding, as if you were there, how it feels to be in the donor prospect's shoes during a planned giving visit; and appreciating the role of the other planned giving team members.\\"  From the Foreword by Terry L. Simmons Vice President and General Counsel Baptist Foundation of Texas \\"The language of philanthropy speaks to a person's heart and soul before it speaks to anything else. It must. If it did not, the tax benefits and the increased income so often touted as incentives to make a planned gift would add up to no incentive at all.\\"  Douglas E. White The art of planned giving entails much more than citing the tax code and spouting investment principles. Beneath all the technical issues lies the real challenge a volatile, unquantifiable human dimension rarely dealt with in the professional literature. Now, in this deeply humane and informative book, Doug White deftly weaves together personal insight and level-headed advice in a probing look at the human side of planned giving. his practical guidance shows you how to understand, develop, and use the interpersonal skills that are an essential part of every successful planned giving officer's art. Instead of concentrating on lengthy technical discussions and tax tips found in other books on the subject, White cuts right to the heart of the psychological and professional challenges involved in the planned giving process. He draws upon his own experiences, as well as those of many colleagues, to provide practical answers to such crucial questions as: How do I successfully approach a prospect for a planned gift? What are the steps to building a prospect's trust and instilling a sense of mission? How can I tell if I'm being too aggressive or not aggressive enough? How do I deal with donors who want a higher payout rate than is good for either them or the charity? How do I handle a donor's lawyer and other advisors who don't support the gift? With the help of an ongoing narrative, White traces the entire process of acquiring a planned gift, from the first phone call to managing the gift's assets. Along the way, he offers many helpful pointers on how to deal with donors, their families, and their professional advisors, as well as other nonprofit managers within your organization, from executive directors to board members. He also suggests strategies for translating technical knowledge into planned gifts that are better for both donors and charities. The first book to take you beyond the mere mechanics and into the very soul of planned giving, The Art of Planned Giving is an important working resource for planned giving officers, fund-raising professionals and consultants, as well as nonprofit executives and board members.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=21hHAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Planned+Giving:+Understanding+Donors+and+the+Culture+of+Giving+(Wiley+Nonprofit+Law,+Finance+and+Management+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Margaret Ogilvy,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6T7yUVSMMcUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kangaroo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mhV-09P-OsYC&dq=Kangaroo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SolidWorks Tutorial 2001PLUS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EpgDAAAACAAJ&dq=SolidWorks+Tutorial+2001PLUS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Top Secret Tales of World War II","description":"Using personal interviews, archival information, and declassified files, the author recalls the tales of espionage, secret missions, sabotage, codebreaking, and kidnapping that marked the \\"secret war\\" of World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lZLtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Top+Secret+Tales+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amendment of Life: A Mystery","description":"For decades, Catherine Aird's crime novels featuring C.D. Sloan have been beloved by fans and lauded by critics for their adroit plotting, playful wit, and literate charm. With Amendment of Life, Aird delivers the lively and engrossing novel that readers have come to rely upon. Detective Chief Inspector C.D. Sloan of the Calleshire CID is used to the occasional oddity in his relatively quiet part of the English countryside. But lately things have taken a strange turn. First, in the center of a yew maze that is the showpiece of the Tudor-era house, Aumerle Court, a body is spotted by Miss Daphne Pedlinge, the elderly chatelaine of the Court. By the time the groundskeeper actually makes it to the center, he, too, spies the body, and it is indeed dead. Meanwhile, a few miles away, a slaughtered rabbit is left on the Bishop's doorstep in nearby Calleford, an omen as portentous as the body in the maze. Now Inspector Sloan, with the somewhat trying personage of Constable Crosby in tow, must uncover what precisely is going on as they launch an investigation with more twists and turns than the maze itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E1sZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"COGNITIVE MODELING","description":"Bayesian inference has become a standard method of analysis in many fields of science.

Short, to-the-point chapters offer examples, exercises, and computer code (using WinBUGS or JAGS, and supported by Matlab and R), with additional support available online. No advance knowledge of statistics is required and, from the very start, readers are encouraged to apply and adjust Bayesian analyses by themselves.

In the stark form of homily that shapes these later works, life considered as one's own has no rational meaning. From the chain of events that follows in the wake of two schoolboys' deception in 'The Forged Coupon' to the disillusionment of the narrator in 'After the Ball' we see, in Virginia Woolf's observation, that Tolstoy puts at the centre of his writing one 'who gathers into himself all experience, turns the world round between his fingers, and never ceases to ask, even as he enjoys it, what is the meaning of it'.

The text provides readers with an overview of the theoretical, institutional and historical formation of ecological knowledge. The varied local conditions of early ecology are considered in detail, while epistemological problems that lie on the borders of ecology, such as disunity and complexity, are discussed. The book traces the various phases of the history of the concept of ecology itself, from its 19th century origins and antecedents, through the emergence of the environmental movement in the later 20th century, to the future, and how ecology might be located in the environmental science framework of the 21st century. The study of  ecological  phenomena has never been confined solely to the work of researchers who consider themselves ecologists. It is rather a field of knowledge in which a plurality of practices, concepts and theories are developed. Thus, there exist numerous disciplinary subdivisions and research programmes within the field, the boundaries of which remain blurred. As a consequence, the deliberation to adequately identify the ecological field of knowledge, its epistemic and institutional setting, is still going on. This will be of central importance not only in locating ecology in the frame of 21st century environmental sciences but also for a better understanding of how nature and culture are intertwined in debates about pressing problems, such as climate change, the protection of species diversity, or the management of renewable resources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZS3mdFlpOUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"12 Jagged Steps","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8bhCPwAACAAJ&dq=12+Jagged+Steps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solid-State Lasers for the Laser Enthusiast: A Guide for the Design and Construction of a High Peak Power Solid-State Laser System","description":"A how-to manual that provides instructions for designing and constructing a real, working laser from readily available parts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O7R8swEACAAJ&dq=Solid-State+Lasers+for+the+Laser+Enthusiast:+A+Guide+for+the+Design+and+Construction+of+a+High+Peak+Power+Solid-State+Laser+System&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Principal as Professional Development Leader","description":"The authors provide principals with the tools needed to help teachers and staff enhance their skills and improve student learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oKXowAEACAAJ&dq=The+Principal+as+Professional+Development+Leader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fourier Optics: An Introduction (Second Edition) (Dover Books on Physics)","description":"\\"A clear and straightforward introduction to the Fourier principles behind modern optics, this text is appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.\\"--Page 4 of cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_-MoAwAAQBAJ&dq=Fourier+Optics:+An+Introduction+(Second+Edition)+(Dover+Books+on+Physics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pathway Home","description":"The way out of tragedy can be a long, intense journey, and in the end it may not be successful.

The hero of J.F. Powers s comic masterpiece is Father Urban, a man of the cloth who is also a man of the world. Charming, with an expansive vision of the spiritual life and a high tolerance for moral ambiguity, Urban enjoys a national reputation as a speaker on the religious circuit and has big plans for the future. But then the provincial head of his dowdy religious order banishes him to a retreat house in the Minnesota hinterlands. Father Urban soon bounces back, carrying God s word with undaunted enthusiasm through the golf courses, fishing lodges, and backyard barbecues of his new turf. Yet even as he triumphs his tribulations mount, and in the end his greatest success proves a setback from which he cannot recover. First published in 1962, Morte D Urban has been praised by writers as various as Gore Vidal, William Gass, Mary Gordon, and Philip Roth. This beautifully observed, often hilarious tale of a most unlikely Knight of Faith is among the finest achievements of an author whose singular vision assures him a permanent place in American literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HVxz_P0jso4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Many moons,","description":"Though many try, only the court jester is able to fulfill Princess Lenore's wish for the moon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=K4V290t092EC&dq=Many+moons,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Goriot (Penguin Classics)","description":"Monsieur Goriot is one of a disparate group of lodgers at Mademe Vauquer's dingy Parisian boarding house.

Halfway through their projected one hundred and twenty day voyage, Captain Tom Dudley and his crew of three men were beset by a monstrous storm off the coast of Africa. After four days of battling towering waves and hurricane gales, their yacht was finally crushed by a ferocious forty foot wave. The survivors were cast adrift a thousand miles from the nearest landfall in an open thirteen foot dinghy without provisions, water or shelter from the scorching sun. When, after twenty four days, they were finally rescued by a passing yacht, the Moctezuma, only three men were left and they were in an appalling condition. The ordeal that they endured and the trial which followed their eventual return to England held the whole nation - from the lowliest ship's deckhand to Queen Victoria herself - spellbound during the following winter. This is the true story of the voyage and the subsequent court case which outlawed for ever a practice followed since men first put to the ocean in boats: the custom of the sea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AfdftrrTr7wC&dq=The+Custom+of+the+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Katrina and the Lost City of New Orleans","description":"New Orleans is the Lost City of America.

In Forever Free, Eric Foner overturns numerous assumptions growing out of the traditional understanding of the period, which is based almost exclusively on white sources and shaped by (often unconscious) racism. He presents the period as a time of determination, especially on the part of recently emancipated black Americans, to put into effect the principles of equal rights and citizenship for all. Drawing on a wide range of long-neglected documents, he places a new emphasis on the centrality of the black experience to an understanding of the era. We see African Americans as active agents in overthrowing slavery, in helping win the Civil War, andeven more activelyin shaping Reconstruction and creating a legacy long obscured and misunderstood. Foner makes clear how, by war s end, freed slaves in the South built on networks of church and family in order to exercise their right of suffrage as well as gain access to education, land, and employment. He shows us that the birth of the Ku Klux Klan and renewed acts of racial violence were retaliation for the progress made by blacks soon after the war. He refutes lingering misconceptions about Reconstruction, including the attribution of its ills to corrupt African American politicians and  carpetbaggers,  and connects it to the movements for civil rights and racial justice. Joshua Brown s illustrated commentary on the era s graphic art and photographs complements the narrative. He offers a unique portrait of how Americans envisioned their world and time. Forever Free is an essential contribution to our understanding of the events that fundamentally reshaped American life after the Civil Wara persuasive reading of history that transforms our sense of the era from a time of failure and despair to a threshold of hope and achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfC7FbdXgxIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Price Guide to Watches","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h0D2IdjAfi8C&dq=Complete+Price+Guide+to+Watches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letting Go of Stress","description":"What would it be like to be stress-free?

Anna Karenina is the story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The story opens when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others. A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry her if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin, a senior government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, and Karenin's indecision. Although Vronsky and Anna go to Italy, where they can be together, they have trouble making friends. Back in Russia, she is shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social life... Widely considered a pinnacle in realist fiction, Tolstoy considered Anna Karenina his first real novel and Dostoevsky declared it to be \\"flawless as a work of art\\".His opinion was shared by Vladimir Nabokov, who especially admired \\"the flawless magic of Tolstoy's style\\", and by William Faulkner, who described the novel as \\"the best ever written\\". About the Maude translation: the translation by Aylmer Maude and Louise Shanks Maude is highly considered by scholars. This unabridged translation from the original Russian was originally published in 1918.The Maudes were classical translators of Leo Tolstoy who worked directly with the author and gained his personal endorsement. About the Garnett translation: Constance Garnett's translation of Anna Karenina is still among the best. Some scholars feel that her language is closer to the 19th-century sense of the original. Garnett translated seventy volumes of Russian prose for publication, including all of Dostoyevsky's novels.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NH7yCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polar Attack: From Canada to the North Pole, and Back","description":"On June 15, 1995, Weber and Malakhov became the first people to complete the 1,000-mile round trip to the North Pole on foot with no outside support.

In The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, eminent Middle East historian Bernard Lewis elucidates the critical role of identity in the domestic, regional, and international tensions and conflicts of the Middle East today. Examining religion, race and language, country, nation, and state, Lewis traces the rapid evolution of the identities of the Middle Eastern peoples, from the collapse of the centuries-old Ottoman Empire in 1918 to today's clash of old and new allegiances. He shows how, during the twentieth century, imported Western ideas such as liberalism, fascism, socialism, patriotism, and nationalism have transformed Middle Easterners' ancient notions of community, their self-perceptions, and their aspirations. To this fascinating historical portrait, Lewis brings an understanding of the region and its peoples, as well as a profound sympathy for the plight that the modern world has imposed on them. The result is an invaluable tool in our understanding of an area that is of increasing global importance and concern today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tmttAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Multiple+Identities+of+the+Middle+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aquel ano en Madrid (Autores Latinoamericanos) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fgive6p08pIC&dq=Aquel+ano+en+Madrid+(Autores+Latinoamericanos)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hope for a Better World!: The Cooperative Community Way","description":"Beyond childcare theories and early childhood gurus, here is how children have actually been raised in America over the last four centuries.

The Nag Hammadi Library consists of writings found by two peasants who unearthed clay jars in 1945 in upper Egypt. These did not appear in English for 32 years, because the right to publish was contended by scholars, politicians, and antique dealers. The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in clay jars in Palestine by a goat herder in 1947, weathered similar storms. The first team of analysts were mostly Christian clergy, who weren't anxious to share material that frightened church leaders. As Dr. Hoeller shows, they rightly feared the documents would reveal information that might detract from unique claims of Christianity. Indeed, the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi Library both contradict and complement accepted tenets of the Old and New Testaments. As to the connection with Jung, Dr. Hoeller states, Jung knew that the one and only tradition associated with Christianity that regarded the human psyche as the container of the divine-human encounter was that of the Gnostics of the the first three centuries of our era. For this reason he called for a renewed appreciation of this ancient tradition, and particularly for a return to the Gnostic sense of God as an inner directing and transforming presence. Dr. Hoeller goes on in his preface, His sympathetic insight into the myths, symbols, and metaphors of the Gnostics, whom by his own admission he regarded as long-lost friends, continues as the brightest beacon of our day... Chapters include such topics as Saintly Rebels: The People of the Scrolls, The Dancing Savior: The Myth of the Gnostic Christ and The Secret Sayings of Jesus: The Gospel of Thomas.

It has been used and promoted by great saints and Popes as a most powerful sacramental. Less well known is the story of the French Sister to whom the Blessed Virgin manifested the Medal in 1830. This Vision Book for 9 - 16 year olds tells the story of Catherine LabourE, a Burgundy farm girl who, after a prophetic dream of St. Vincent de Paul, became a Sister of Charity in Paris and later in Enghien, where she cooked and mended and cared for the inmates of a home for elderly men. To this obscure Sister the Blessed Virgin appeared, made prophecies, and commissioned the making of the Medal which soon came to be known as \\"miraculous\\" because of the favors wrought. St. Catherine LabourE lived a life of prayer and service to the poor, and was canonized in 1947.

Paul Jung takes the pre-med or second-career aspirant from pre-application experiences through the application process with a very practical approach. The book is filled with the pitfalls and misconceptions applicants frequently make, rendering the subtitle particularly apt and (for those terrified of the unknowns) eminently appealing. The volume also includes self-diagnostic sections and common pitfalls to avoid when applying to medical school. Contrary to popular belief, applying to medical school doesn't have to be stressful and time-consuming. Getting In shows students caught in the web of medical school admissions boards how to apply to medical school the right way setting themselves apart from the rest of the crowd. Jung takes pre-med and second-career aspirants through the entire ordeal and lets them know how important it is to apply as early as possible. From preparation and finding ways to obtain an application noticed by the admissions committee to information on the MCAT and getting through common interview traps, the book gives inside tips and helps applicants through what can be a stressful and uncertain time.

Archaeology has shown that fish have always been important to the Egyptians; prehistoric man depended upon them, the Egyptians of Dynastic times used them as both food and currency and they have been a delicacy ever since. This study explores their economic and religious significance and examines Ancient Egyptian fishing methods, the techniques of which were beautifully depicted in paintings and reliefs by the Egyptians. Fishing tackle, harpoons, fish-hooks, fish-traps and nets are described and illustrated with examples from the ancient art. The core of this fascinating work is the detailed description of some twenty different species which are shown in detail by the Egyptians. Some are well known to all archaeologists, like the 'bolti' or Tilapia. Others are much more curious like the amphibious Clarias or the electric catfish Malapterurus electricus with his 200 volt sting. Each species is identified, fully described and illustrated. Finally there is an appendix on osteology that will enable archaeologists to identify the bones they excavate. This book will be invaluable to both archaeologists and ichthyologists and important for the study of the art and religion of Ancient Egypt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tYacQgAACAAJ&dq=Fish+and+Fishing+in+Ancient+Egypt+(The+Natural+History+of+Egypt)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hamilton family of Charles county, Maryland","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SnhzAAAACAAJ&dq=Hamilton+family+of+Charles+county,+Maryland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures","description":"Java Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures is intended for a two-semester CS1/CS2 sequence in Java, beginning with core computer science concepts and moving into data structures later in the text.

As a theory and a movement bringing together feminism, environmentalism, socialism, and peace activism, ecofeminism began taking shape in the U.S. by 1980. Four years later, many ecofeminists participated in founding and developing the U.S. Green movement. Where are these movements today? A member of both movements, Greta Gaard bases her analysis on personal experience as well as extensive secondary sources and interviews with key theorists, activists, and speakers across the United States. She describes the paths -- environmental causes, the feminist peace movement, the feminist spirituality movement, the animal liberation movement, and the anti-toxics movement, as well as experiences of interconnectedness -- that have led women (and a few men) to articulate an ecofeminist perspective. The book illustrates the development of the Greens from a national movement into a political party and defines the factions -- the Left Greens, the Youth Greens, and the Green Politics Network -- that underlay the debates during Ralph Nader's 1996 presidential campaign. She sees the history of these three groups as stages in the transition from a leftist and sometimes anarchist focus to an emphasis on electoral political action that places the Green movement squarely within the pattern of other social movements around the world. Gaard's analysis illuminates the nature and direction of each of these important movements and the pressures and conflictsexperienced by all social movements at the end of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qlBzEAAAQBAJ&dq=Ecological+Politics:+Ecofeminists+and+the+Greens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Northland castaways","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KIFTAAAAYAAJ&dq=Northland+castaways&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One's Company: A Practical Guide to Enjoying Your Independence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BFewzgEACAAJ&dq=One%27s+Company:+A+Practical+Guide+to+Enjoying+Your+Independence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leviathan: or, The matter, form, and power of a commonwealth, ecclesiastical and civil (His: English works)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-rldAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Moments of Happiness (Notecards)","description":"Amazon, Apple, Facebook, en Google zijn vier van de invloedrijkste bedrijven ter wereld.

In Networked Press Freedom, Mike Ananny offers a new way to think about freedom of the press in a time when media systems are in fundamental flux. Ananny challenges the idea that press freedom comes only from heroic, lone journalists who speak truth to power. Instead, drawing on journalism studies, institutional sociology, political theory, science and technology studies, and an analysis of ten years of journalism discourse about news and technology, he argues that press freedom emerges from social, technological, institutional, and normative forces that vie for power and fight for visions of democratic life. He shows how dominant, historical ideals of professionalized press freedom often mistook journalistic freedom from constraints for the public's freedom to encounter the rich mix of people and ideas that self-governance requires. Ananny's notion of press freedom ensures not only an individual right to speak, but also a public right to hear. Seeing press freedom as essential for democratic self-governance, Ananny explores what publics need, what kind of free press they should demand, and how today's press freedom emerges from intertwined collections of humans and machines. If someone says,  The public needs a free press,  Ananny urges us to ask in response,  What kind of public, what kind of freedom, and what kind of press?  Answering these questions shows what robust, self-governing publics need to demand of technologists and journalists alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TRdZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Destiny of Freedom","description":"The popular psychoanalyst examines the continuing tension in our lives between the possibilities that freedom offers and the various limitations imposed upon us by our particular fate or destiny. \\"May is an existential analyst who deservedly enjoys a reputation among both general and critical readers as an accessible and insightful social and psychological theorist. . . .

While at Harvard College, Dana had an attack of the measles which affected his vision. Thinking it might help his sight, Dana, rather than going on a Grand Tour as most of his fellow classmates traditionally did (and unable to afford it anyway) and being something of a non-conformist, left Harvard to enlist as a common sailor on a voyage around Cape Horn on the brig Pilgrim. He returned to Massachusetts two years later aboard the Alert (which left California sooner than the Pilgrim). He kept a diary throughout the voyage, and, after returning, he wrote a recognized American classic, Two Years Before the Mast, published in 1840, the same year of his admission to the bar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rzf0QQAACAAJ&dq=Life+Before+the+Mast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daylight : A Daybook of Spiritual Guidance","description":"The spiritual influence of Jelaluddin Rumi (1207-1273) is increasing among people of diverse beliefs throughout the western world.

The most recent phase started in 1947 with the discovery of the electromagnetic level shifts and the realization that the exist ing theory, when properly interpreted, was perfectly adequate to explain these effects to an apparently unlimited degree of accuracy. This phase has now reached a certain conclusion: for the first time in the checkered history of this field of research it has become possible to give a unified and consistent presen tation of radiation theory in full conformity with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics. To this task the present book is devoted. The plan for a book of this type was conceived during the year 1951 while the first-named author (J. M. J. ) held a Fulbright research scholarship at Cambridge University. During this year of freedom from teaching and other duties he had the opportunity of conferring with physicists in many different countries on the recent developments in radiation theory. The comments seemed to be almost unanimous that a book on quantum electrodynamics at the present time would be of inestimable value to physicists in many parts of the world. However, it was not until the spring of 1952 that work on the book began in earnest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Epn6CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting In: How Not To Apply to Medical School (Medical Student Survival Series)","description":"Getting In: How Not To Apply to Medical School is a tough, practical guide for people storming the ramparts of medical school admission boards. Paul Jung takes the pre-med or second-career aspirant from pre-application experiences through the application process with a very practical approach. The book is filled with the pitfalls and misconceptions applicants frequently make, rendering the subtitle particularly apt and (for those terrified of the unknowns) eminently appealing. The volume also includes self-diagnostic sections and common pitfalls to avoid when applying to medical school. Contrary to popular belief, applying to medical school doesn't have to be stressful and time-consuming. Getting In shows students caught in the web of medical school admissions boards how to apply to medical school the right way setting themselves apart from the rest of the crowd. Jung takes pre-med and second-career aspirants through the entire ordeal and lets them know how important it is to apply as early as possible. From preparation and finding ways to obtain an application noticed by the admissions committee to information on the MCAT and getting through common interview traps, the book gives inside tips and helps applicants through what can be a stressful and uncertain time. The author allows readers a glimpse into common errors that others have made in their quests for acceptance, such as taking all required science courses in one semester or leaving large chunks of a medical application blank. Taking a down-to-earth, realistic approach, Jung acknowledges the pitfalls and misconceptions frequently made by applicants and even provides alternative solutions for discouraged students. The result is a well-written book that describes hardships and blunders but also gives good, practical information on how to succeed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4RVM911Gx8oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the promises of the Bible;: A unique compilation and exposition of Divine promises in Scripture,","description":"Offers commentary upon those biblical passages which express God's promises to man","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nCtKPwAACAAJ&dq=All+the+promises+of+the+Bible%3B:+A+unique+compilation+and+exposition+of+Divine+promises+in+Scripture,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mountain panoramas from the Pamirs and Kwen Lun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XSI8AAAAMAAJ&dq=Mountain+panoramas+from+the+Pamirs+and+Kwen+Lun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blimey Another Book About London","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ygoYKQAACAAJ&dq=Blimey+Another+Book+About+London&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bmw R50/5 Through R100Gs Pd: 1970-1996 (Clymer Motorcycle Repair)","description":"R50/5 (1970-1973), R60/5 (1970-1973), R60/6 (1973-1976), R60/7 (1976-1978), R65 (1978-1985), R65/85 (1985-1987), R65LS (1982-1985), R75/5 (1970-1973), R75/6 (1973-1976), R75/7 (1976-1977), R80/7 (1978-1980), R80G/S (1980-1986), R80ST (1982-1984), R80RT (1","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LVbXwAEACAAJ&dq=Bmw+R50/5+Through+R100Gs+Pd:+1970-1996+(Clymer+Motorcycle+Repair)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Immigration : Family Relations Visa Package (Do-it-Yourself Immigration Kits)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lDnrAAAACAAJ&dq=American+Immigration+:+Family+Relations+Visa+Package+(Do-it-Yourself+Immigration+Kits)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patenting Art & Entertainment: New Strategies for Protecting Creative Ideas (Patenting Art and Entertainment)","description":"Protect your creations by protecting your unique ways of making them!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Bq-KAqJYgCUC&dq=Patenting+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate (Aubrey-Maturin series, Book 7)(Library Edition)","description":"Als een Engelse luitenant-ter-zee in 1800 het bevel krijgt over het schip de \\"Sophie\\", vraagt hij een bevriende arts scheepsdokter te worden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uNPAAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Surgeon%27s+Mate+(Aubrey-Maturin+series,+Book+7)(Library+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Different Drum","description":"\`The overall purpose of human communication is - or should be - reconciliation.

He celebrates both the problems and potentials of the active life, revealing how much they have to teach us about ourselves, the world, and God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=djFaAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Active+Life:+A+Spirituality+of+Work,+Creativity,+and+Caring&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Olympic Mountains trail guide: National Park & National Forest","description":"You'll find new information on 177 hikes and extensive material on history, geology, native plants, and wildlife.

Best-selling doctors, Hemfelt, Minirth, and Meier, walk you through their ten proven stages to recovery from codependency that results from external circumstances. Humans are susceptible to codependency because of our sinful tendency to use defense mechanisms to fool ourselves. In codependent relationships, deceitful games are played, and important Christian principles are often taken out of context and abused. God wants us to have healthy relationships with a balance between being dependent and independent. The doctors describe how the most effective means of overcoming codependent relationships is to establish or deepen a relationship with Christ Himself. They describe the causes of codependency, pointing out the factors that perpetuate it, and lead readers through their ten stages of recovery.

The significance of where people worshipped their gods has been far less acknowledged. In 1884 Francois de Polignac argued that the placing of cult centres played a major part in establishing the concept of the city-state in archaic Greece. The essays in this collection, headed by that of de Polignac himself in which he re-assesses his position, critically examine the social and political importance of sanctuary placement, not only by re-examining the case of the archaic Greece discussed by de Polignac, but by extending analysis both back to Mycenaean times and onwards to Greece under Roman occupation. These essays reveal something of the complexity of relations between religion and politics in ancient Greece, demonstrating how vital factors such as tradition, gender relations, and cult identity were in creating and maintaining the religious mapping of the Greek countryside","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FnjXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Placing+the+Gods:+Sanctuaries+and+Sacred+Space+in+Ancient+Greece&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winged Man","description":"To this day, throughout the ancient city of Bath, there exist statues and images of the man who was the legendary founder of the city, and the father of King Lear. A leper and a swineherd... a necromancer and a wise king... his memory lives on. Restless at the royal court, the young Prince Bladud sets off to consult an oracle in the west country - a wild wooded place near a mysterious hot spring that gushes from a cave. There the priestess tells him that he will be a great king, and that one day he will fly like an eagle. When he returns to his father's hill-fort at Trinovantum, ancient London, Bladud's head is full of magnificent dreams... until trickery entraps him in a loveless marriage. His unquenchable thirst for knowledge, sharpened by a mysterious experience at the burial mound of his forefathers, takes him away from his home and wife on a dangerous journey to faraway Greece. There he meets and falls in love with a woman who has appeared to him many times already in dreams and visions. On returning to his own country, he finds his father dying and his wife conspiring with his brother to disinherit him. Then, found to be suffering from a disease believed to be leprosy, he is driven from the court and shunned by his people. In this dark time he becomes a swineherd. One day, he notices his pigs are free of sores after wallowing in hot mud. He tries the healing waters of Sul himself, is cured, and returns to claim his throne... His was a golden age of wisdom and magic, where Otherworld beings mingle freely with the people of this world, and where swans and ravens and owls take on their own special mysterious significance. Full of brilliant imagination, this colourful fantasy draws its strength and inspiration from the strange and beautiful realms of Celtic and Greek myth and legend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3vtcRwnlBtQC&dq=The+Winged+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"True stories of spiritual power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jVxGHAAACAAJ&dq=True+stories+of+spiritual+power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atonement and Violence: A Theological Conversation","description":"The authors of this book claim that to abandon the Christian doctrine of the Atonement is to abandon the central witness of the gospel, for atonement speaks of nothing less than God 's reconciliation of the world in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

What she needs, Alice decides, is a gorgeous woman who does everything right, as a roadmap, so to speak. If only she finds herself, when school begins, in the classroom of the beautiful sixth-grade teacher, Miss Cole, her troubles will be over.

Marva Dawn writes compassionately for those who suffer, for this book was born out of her own struggles with physical limitations and chronic illness, and it is intended to help the whole Church learn how to find Joy in every circumstance of life, especially in trials and sufferings. After outlining some important foundational principles in three introductory chapters, Dawn guides readers through the whole book of Revelation, pointing out the errors of those who try to calendarize the end of the world and instead delineating how The Revelation reveals Christ's Lordship, exposes the workings of the powers, and sustains those who suffer until evil is ultimately defeated. Now thoroughly revised for a wider readership, Joy in Our Weakness highlights The Revelation's original purpose -- to comfort afflicted, suffering believers -- and spells out a biblically grounded \\"theology of weakness,\\" offering a rare gift to the Church today. A wealth of insight and encouragement truly awaits the readers of these pages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9EZ9jUostx8C&dq=Joy+in+Our+Weakness:+A+Gift+of+Hope+from+the+Book+of+Revelation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Self-Revealed Knowledge That Liberates the Spirit: A Handbook of Essential Information for Experiencing a Conscious Relationship With the Infinite and Restoring Soul Awareness to Wholeness","description":"In this important book, Roy Eugene Davis explains why authentic spiritual awakening that provides a new perception of reality and makes possible a clear view of exceptional possibilities is of primary importance for our total well-being and for the nurturing and support of the collective consciousness of Planet Earth.

Food that's easy, delicious, and casual. Charlie Palmer shows how to make comfort foods that are comfortable, but with a new level of taste and sophistication. Sunday supper suddenly becomes sensational. And those quick mid-week meals are still quick to prepare; they just don't taste that way. Corn chowder is heartier, more intense. Traditional tuna melts become untraditional with fresh tuna, tapenade, and Fontina. That childhood favorite, Waldorf salad becomes a modern classic with apple cider, walnut oil, and a pinch of curry powder. Baked Lemon Chicken with a pile of garlic bread, a bowl of cheesy orzo or rice and a big salad of romaine will become a Saturday night favorite, just as it is in Charlie's house. Turn Sunday's leftover Perfect Roast Chicken into Monday's Chicken Noodle Soup or Aioli Chicken Salad. When company comes calling and you're looking for something a bit more sophisticated, try Charlie's Whole Roasted Salmon with New Potatoes and Leeks and Baked Wild Mushroom Salad or Lamb Shanks with Tomatoes, Lentils and Olives. Or, if you want to treat company just like family, feed them Charlie's Mom's Barbecued Chicken, Perfect Pot Roast or a heaping platter of Linguini with Eggplant Ragu. And what about desserts? Charlie has something to bring out the kid in everyone. Try his Brownie-Ice Cream Sandwiches or Apple Pizza with Cider Sorbet. His Pumpkin Custard is so easy and versatile, it can be baked family-style in one large dish or in individual souffle cups when company is expected. Serve the custard with a plate of Ginger Cookies.

Enriched with fifty-five illustrations, including spectacular photos of New Orleans's famed Mardi Gras Indians, Joseph Roach's work employs an entirely unique approach to the study of culture. Rather than focusing on one region, Cities of the Dead describes broad cultural connections over place and time, showing through myriad examples how performance can revise the unwritten past. Through illuminating discussions of social events ranging from burials to sacrifices, from auctions to parades, encompassing regional traditions as diverse as Haitian Voudon and British funerals, the book looks at the synchretic performance traditions of Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Exploring processes of substitution, or surrogation, as enacted in performance, Roach demonstrates the ways in which we fill the voids left by death and departure. Cities of the Dead proposes a new way to think about the relationship between history and memory as well as between document and performance.

In this volume, he describes the orthogonal groups, either with real or complex parameters including reflections, and also the related groups with indefinite metrics. He develops the theory of spinors (he discovered the general mathematical form of spinors in 1913) systematically by giving a purely geometrical definition of these mathematical entities; this geometrical origin makes it very easy to introduce spinors into Riemannian geometry, and particularly to apply the idea of parallel transport to these geometrical entities. The book is divided into two parts. The first is devoted to generalities on the group of rotations in n-dimensional space and on the linear representations of groups, and to the theory of spinors in three-dimensional space. Finally, the linear representations of the group of rotations in that space (of particular importance to quantum mechanics) are also examined. The second part is devoted to the theory of spinors in spaces of any number of dimensions, and particularly in the space of special relativity (Minkowski space). While the basic orientation of the book as a whole is mathematical, physicists will be especially interested in the final chapters treating the applications of spinors in the rotation and Lorentz groups. In this connection, Cartan shows how to derive the \\"Dirac\\" equation for any group, and extends the equation to general relativity. One of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, Cartan made notable contributions in mathematical physics, differential geometry, and group theory. Although a profound theorist, he was able to explain difficult concepts with clarity and simplicity. In this detailed, explicit treatise, mathematicians specializing in quantum mechanics will find his lucid approach a great value.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AEZ1h7Cg3cwC&dq=Theoretical+Solid+State+Physics,+Volume+1:+Perfect+Lattices+in+Equilibrium+(Dover+Books+on+Physics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yesh!

Steve Jobs en Apple hadden een iconische status verworven en nu hij er niet meer was voorspelden critici een desastreuse toekomst. Maar zij hadden het mis. We zijn acht jaar verder en onder Cooks leiderschap heeft Apple alle verwachtingen overtroffen en is de verwachte ondergang overgegaan in een zelfs nog grotere groei.

Working in a community of learners, Phyllis Whitin encouraged her students to respond to their readings through sketched interpretations. Like pieces of writing, the sketches became a vital part of the curriculum as vehicles for discussion and reflective tools for understanding.

The genre really took off following the explosion of furry fandom in the 21st century, with talking animals featuring in everything from science fiction to fantasy to LGBTQ coming-out stories. In his lifetime, Fred Patten (1940-2018)--one of the founders of furry fandom and a scholar of anthropomorphic animal literature--authored hundreds of book reviews that comprise a comprehensive critical survey of the genre.

Authors Linda Lyman and Christine Villani take a unique approach by inviting readers into two high-poverty elementary schools where they will experience, through in-depth case studies, how two extraordinary principals model and practice their beliefs in the ability and worth of all children. Lyman and Villani demonstrate that a successful learning community for children of low-income families is based on the beliefs and attitudes of the school leader and the entire school community. Preparation programs for school principals typically do not provide for study of the complexity of poverty or the leadership practices that contribute to successful learning and achievement for children in high-poverty schools. The concluding questions that the authors pose provide a guide to developing best leadership practices that make a difference to the learning, achievement, and lives of children who live in poverty.This book offers: an insightful overview of research about leadership strategies and beliefs in high-poverty schools, causes and remedies for the achievement gap, evidence of continuing racial and ethnic prejudice, the widespread deficit thinking that limits learning. The authors challenge leaders, teachers, staff members, and others to examine their own attitudes and beliefs and then to commit to creating successful learning communities for all children from low-income families. This book is written as a resource for aspiring and practicing principals, or anyone interested in improving educational opportunities for children from families living in poverty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AZfZvQmdap0C&dq=Best+Leadership+Practices+for+High-Poverty+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turnbulls","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3eqfyLaOf0wC&dq=The+Turnbulls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cane River","description":"Set among the plantations in deepest Louisiana, CANE RIVER follows the lives of five generations of women from the time of slavery in the early 1800s into the early years of the 20th century.

Therefore, it might be reasonably argued that there is little room for another volume. Nonetheless, this vast outpouring of literature has usually dealt with major leaders, specific battles or campaigns, and with certain branches of the service. Moreover, at least in English, the literature tends to concentrate primarily on the French or British armies. There appears to be a lack of works combining a description of the major changes and trends in the art of war, especially at the cutting edge of events, with a discussion of the French military establishment and the armies of the major opponents, British as well as continental. And while this book is only a brief survey, I do believe that it may serve as a contribution towards filling this gap in our historical knowledge of military institutions and fighting men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jxqdnKQrAmEC&dq=Warfare+in+the+Age+of+Bonaparte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiawatha","description":"Antropoloog en filosoof Ton Lemaire is bekend van zijn boeken 'Filosofie van het landschap', 'De val van Prometheus' en 'Verre velden'.

Het in 1885 gepubliceerde lange epische gedicht geldt als een van de bekendste teksten van de negentiende eeuw. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow gaf in dit lied po?tische vorm aan de mythische verhalen van de Ojibwa-indianen rond de Grote Meren en maakte zo hun held Hiawatha en de wereld van de indianen literair respectabel. Ton Lemaire beschrijft hoe het lied van Hiawatha uitgroeide tot een nationaal epos waarmee de Verenigde Staten haar culturele identiteit kon bevestigen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=91n_AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Access 2000 Core (Mous Exan Preparation Guide)","description":"Based on the MOUS exam itself (and certified by Microsoft), the streamlined PH MOUS Test Preparation Guide for Access 2000 book/software package coaches users through successful completion of the MOUS certification exam--from Core to Expert skill levels.

With inner envy and a hammer blow from the subconscious, backlash of tears and torment, crying how can this have happened? Where did we go wrong? Like a parent, whose child has gone astray, we weep over the wreckage of what once was, and only dream, of what could have been. As we ponder through the ages embedded in the decaying Imperial Archives, my wife and I discover the cache of data crystals. Once lost, or forgotten, buried within the ruins of the Capital Areas infrastructure, we now bring to light the sagas of a lost world. Such wondrous times are embodied within, we sing of a freshness never felt! Of a remarkable Young Man, Alack Troyus and his mission to fight crime and injustice from the Special Services. His adventures span the entire length and depth of an age long ago, forgotten. Fighting the evils of a brave new Empire, a true hero we of these dreary days only dream about in a childs apprehension. The passage of time is relentless, unyielding, a constant beating of the elements against our fragile memories. But here, in the dimness of these ruins, the glory is revealed and the truth once again shines forth! Amazia, her Society, her government and servants, the vitality is reborn in the tales. Such stories of youthful energy, where all of stellar creation is a playing field for Alack Troyus, going recklessly forward, never stumbling, but always landing on his feet. His voice, once only a silent whisper, now a shout bridging the ages, circling the fallen pediments, they rise up in grandeur, restored, as the tales live again!

This inwardness or interiority unique to me as an essential feature of who I am has been an aspect of culture and even a defining characteristic of human being; an authentic, private sphere to which we can retreat that is beyond the conflicts of the outer world. This inner world becomes more real than the outer, which is seen as but a pale reflection. Remarkably, the image of the truth within is found across cultures, and this book presents an account of this idea in the pre-modern history of Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Furthermore, in theistic religions, Christianity, and some forms of Hinduism, the truth within is conflated with the idea of God within, and in all cases this inner truth is thought to be not only the heart of the person, but also the heart of the universe itself. Gavin Flood examines the metaphor of inwardness and the idea of truth within, along with the methods developed in religions to attain it such as prayer and meditation. These views of inwardness that link the self to cosmology can be contrasted with a modern understanding of the person. In examining the truth within in Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism, Flood offers a hermeneutical phenomenology of inwardness and a defence of comparative religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HursrQEACAAJ&dq=The+Truth+Within&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diaries of Giacomo Meyerbeer: 1791-1839","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K3V2vCxvYNkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Airman's Odyssey (A Trilogy comprising Wind, Sand & Stars, Night Flight, Flight to Arras)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a1uBswEACAAJ&dq=Airman%27s+Odyssey+(A+Trilogy+comprising+Wind,+Sand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guerrilla Financing (Guerrilla Marketing)","description":"Details sources for funding small and medium-sized businesses, offering a four-step plan for finding and obtaining financing and listing funding sources","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O42-ZMIq35wC&dq=Guerrilla+Financing+(Guerrilla+Marketing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aleman: Para El Viajero (Phrasebooks) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Spanish language edition of Lonely Planet's German phrasebook.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SsPbsgEACAAJ&dq=Aleman:+Para+El+Viajero+(Phrasebooks)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irish Fire","description":"The next book in the Irish Heart Series.

We are not so much diminished as enlarged by grief, by our refusal to vanish, or to let others vanish, without leaving a record. And poets are people who are determined to leave a trace in words, to transform oceanic depths of feeling into art that speaks to others. In 100 Poems to Break Your Heart, poet and advocate Edward Hirsch selects 100 poems, from the nineteenth century to the present, and illuminates them, unpacking context and references to help the reader fully experience the range of emotion and wisdom within these poems. For anyone trying to process grief, loneliness, or fear, this collection of poetry will be your guide in trying times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mHb3DwAAQBAJ&dq=It+Can+Break+Your+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Fought Like Demons - Women Soldiers in the American Civil War","description":"Popular images of women during the American Civil War include self-sacrificing nurses, romantic spies, and brave ladies maintaining hearth and home in the absence of their men. However, as DeAnne Blanton and Lauren M. Cook show in their remarkable new study, that conventional picture does not tell the entire story. Hundreds of women assumed male aliases, disguised themselves in men s uniforms, and charged into battle as Union and Confederate soldiers facing down not only the guns of the adversary but also the gender prejudices of society. They Fought Like Demons is the first book to fully explore and explain these women, their experiences as combatants, and the controversial issues surrounding their military service. Relying on more than a decade of research in primary sources, Blanton and Cook document over 240 women in uniform and find that their reasons for fighting mirrored those of men -patriotism, honor, heritage, and a desire for excitement. Some enlisted to remain with husbands or brothers, while others had dressed as men before the war. Some so enjoyed being freed from traditional women s roles that they continued their masquerade well after 1865. The authors describe how Yankee and Rebel women soldiers eluded detection, some for many years, and even merited promotion.

Reelfoot Lake has been a hunting and fishing paradise from the time of its creation in 1812, when the New Madrid earthquake caused the Mississippi River to flow backward into low-lying lands. Situated in the northwestern corner of the state of Tennessee, it attracted westward-moving pioneers, enticing some to settle permanently on its shores. Threatened in 1908 with the loss of their homes and livelihoods to aggressive, outsider capitalists, rural folk whose families had lived for generations on the bountiful lake donned hoods and gowns and engaged in  night riding,  spreading mayhem and death throughout the region as they sought vigilante justice. They had come to regard the lake as their own, by  squatters' rights,  but now a group of entrepreneurs from St. Louis had bought the titles to the land beneath the shallow lake and were laying legal claim to Reelfoot in its entirety. People were hanged, beaten, and threatened and property destroyed before the state militia finally quelled the uprising. A compromise that made the lake public property did not entirely heal the wounds which continue to this day. Paul Vanderwood reconstructs these harrowing events from newspapers and other accounts of the time. He also obtained personal interviews with participants and family members who earlier had remained mum, still fearing prosecution. The Journal of American History declares his book  the complete and authentic treatment  of the horrific dispute and its troubled aftermath.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nSB6CgAAQBAJ&dq=Night+Riders+of+Reelfoot+Lake+(Alabama+Fire+Ant)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rembrandt's Hat","description":"This collection of short stories by Bernard Malamud includes: The Silver Crown Man in the Drawer The Letter In Retirement Rembrandt's Hat Notes from a Lady at a Dinner Party My Son the Murderer Talking Horse","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UelD2ndA6ScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Value and capital;: An inquiry into some fundamental principles of economic theory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xfx3ngEACAAJ&dq=Value+and+capital%3B:+An+inquiry+into+some+fundamental+principles+of+economic+theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Celluliod to Cyberspace: The Media Arts and the Changing Arts World","description":"Current knowledge of the operation of the arts world and its underlying dynamics is limited, especially with regard to the media arts--art that is produced using or combining film, video, and computers.

Hasty decodes the styles and uncovers the strategies that characterize Ghana's major printed news media, focusing on the differences between news generated by the state and news that comes from private sources. Not only are the angles radically different, but so are ways of gathering the news, assigning beats, using sources, and writing articles. For all its differences in presentation, however, Hasty shows that the news in Ghana projects a unified voice that is the result of a contentious and multifarious process that joins Ghanaians in global, national, and local debates. An important engagement with the production of news and news media, this book also explores questions about the relationship of popular culture to state politics, the expression of civic culture, and the role of the media in constituting national and cultural identities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bH1yXOH69n4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Another Day in Paradise: International Humanitarian Workers Tell Their Stories","description":"Sudan, Rwanda, Somalia, Afghanistan, Bosnia, the Gaza Strip...

The attorneys, the jury, the law enforcement officers, the prison guards, the wardens overseeing the execution, the chaplains and advisors, the technicians who prepare the syringe and prick the vein - all of these people are affected, and they all have powerful stories to tell, stories that are woven together in the riveting narrative of Living Next Door to the Death House. Authors Virginia Stem Owens and David Clinton Owens live in Huntsville, Texas, which has earned a reputation as the death penalty capital of the United States. They call Huntsville a company town, where the company in question, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, employs almost a quarter of the residents. With so much of the population directly connected to the prison system, the ultimate punishment - meted out as often as once a week - is always next door.Through candid, compelling interviews with those in Huntsville connected both personally and professionally to the Texas prison system and death row, the authors explore how the steady stream of executions in the town has affected these people and the community at large.As the Owenses show, the ever-present death chamber reaches out like tentacles to touch the lives of everyone who lives here. Some of the people they talk to are in favor of the death penalty, some are against it, many are conflicted. Living Next Door to the Death House shows unforgettably the human face of one of the most controversial and hotly debated issues in the United States today. A marval of clear-eyed journalism, human sympathy, and judicious reflection. - Annie Dillard","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3R1ZAAAACAAJ&dq=Living+Next+Door+to+the+Death+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE GREEK ARMIES","description":"Illustrated with color photos, this guide details the arms, armor, organization, and tactics of Classical Greek armies.

Good work and my congratulations! Ken Varga, President Professional Buyers GuildVictims, Villains and Heroes: Managing Emotions in the Workplace has contributed a valuable piece to my education in relationships, which are the core of my business (and yours!). The old dramas I used to unwittingly play took about 70 percent of my energy--energy that can now be used productively. I've learned how to avoid the hidden traps of the Victim, the Villain and the Negative Hero--the ones at work, and the ones battling it out inside of me. I've stopped trying to save the world and started taking care of me and, ironically, am making MORE of a difference now--and having more fun working and laughing a lot more. I am being my own Hero, and the satisfaction that comes with that is amazing. My effectiveness as a speaker, trainer and consultant has increased with this knowledge. I am becoming a much wiser woman! Loy and Don, much gratitude. Bobbie Jones, Trainer and Consultant for IBM, Advanced Microdevices, Samsung and many U.S. clientsExcellent . . . excellent . . .

The ideas you talked about, I have been repeating on a regular daily basis. The 80/20/40 image of managing energy has been particularly useful personally. And last but definitely not least, the parallels of using your ideas in my home life has been amazing! Without going into all the details, let's just say that my husband and I have actually been really communicating since the Friday seminar! Anne Dor, Co-Founder RM Automation Systems\\"Attending one of Don's seminars made the decision to buy this book an easy one. As a business consultant who deals with how HR impacts a business' bottom line, I found this book a veritable treasure trove of gems and nuggets of practical wisdom. His metaphor of \\"the stage\\" is pure genius and has yielded the unexpected bonus of benefiting my personal life as much as my professional.

In Continental Divide, Maurice Isserman tells the history of American mountaineering through four centuries of landmark climbs and first ascents. Mountains were originally seen as obstacles to civilization; over time they came to be viewed as places of redemption and renewal. The White Mountains stirred the transcendentalists; the Rockies and Sierras pulled explorers westward toward Manifest Destiny; Yosemite inspired the early environmental conservationists. Climbing began in North America as a pursuit for lone eccentrics but grew to become a mass-participation sport. Beginning with Darby Field in 1642, the first person to climb a mountain in North America, Isserman describes the exploration and first ascents of the major American mountain ranges, from the Appalachians to Alaska. He also profiles the most important American mountaineers, including such figures as John C. Fr mont, John Muir, Annie Peck, Bradford Washburn, Charlie Houston, and Bob Bates, relating their exploits both at home and abroad. Isserman traces the evolving social, cultural, and political roles mountains played in shaping the country. He describes how American mountaineers forged a \\"brotherhood of the rope,\\" modeled on America s unique democratic self-image that characterized climbing in the years leading up to and immediately following World War II. And he underscores the impact of the postwar \\"rucksack revolution,\\" including the advances in technique and style made by pioneering \\"dirtbag\\" rock climbers. A magnificent, deeply researched history, Continental Divide tells a story of adventure and aspiration in the high peaks that makes a vivid case for the importance of mountains to American national identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nfh1CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Feuds in History: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever","description":"The dramatic stories of ten historic feuds: How they altered the course of discovery-and shaped the modern world Hall Hellman tells the lively stories of ten of the most outrageous and intriguing disputes from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries.

Kerenyi wrote on two of the most ubiquitous myths, the Divine Child and The Maiden, supporting the core 'stories' with both an introduction and a conclusion. Jung then provided a psychological analysis of both myths. He defined myth as a story about heroes interacting with the gods. Having long studied dreams and the subconscious, Jung identified certain dream patterns common to everyone. These 'archetypes' have developed through the centuries, and enable modern people to react to situations in much the same way as our ancestors. From nuclear annihilation to AIDS and Ebola, we continue to engage the gods in battle. Science of Mythology provides an account of the meaning and the purpose of mythic themes that is linked to modern life: the heroic battles between good and evil of yore are still played out, reflected in contemporary fears.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5DLNW0T1eOoC&dq=Essays+on+a+Science+of+Mythology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Wind in Jamaica","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kLEMrgEACAAJ&dq=High+Wind+in+Jamaica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poodle: The Other White Meat: The Second Sherman's Lagoon Collection","description":"\\"It's easy to understand why Sherman's Lagoon has captured a considerable national following--and this number includes children as well as adults.\\" --Mount Airy News As the title of this Sherman's Lagoon collection would indicate, creator Jim Toomey is not overly concerned about his strip being politically correct. \\"Nothing is above ridicule,\\" says Toomey. Poodle: The Other White Meat is filled with the no-holds-barred humor that has made Sherman's Lagoon an international success. The popular cartoon takes a lighthearted yet satirical look at pop culture through the eyes of its namesake character, Sherman, the dim-witted but fun-loving shark. While the strip centers around the adventures of Sherman, his fellow underwater brethren are good for great laughs as well. Therea?s: *Fillmore, the leading shark's trusty turtle sidekick; *Megan, Sherman's significant-shark-other; *Hawthorne, the cranky hermit crab who lives in a beer can; *Ernest, a computer-hacking pop philosopher; *And a host of other silly sea creatures that inhabit the lagoon just off the make-believe South Pacific island of Kapupu. Sherman is, shall we say, not the sharpest fishing hook in the tackle box. One minute he exasperates Fillmore with nonsensical ideas like videotaping every moment of his day in case something happens. Then, when something really does occur--the arrival of space aliens--Fillmore later discovers that all that was documented was the back of the camera's lens cap! And so it goes with the irreverent cast of characters featured in Poodle: The Other White Meat.

So-called primitive peoples show a surprisingly sophisticated understanding of how their bodies interact with plant chemicals, which may allow us to rediscover the origins of diet by retracing the paths of biology and culture. The domestication of the potato serves as the focus of Timothy Johns's interdisciplinary study, which forges a bold synthesis of ethnobotany and chemical ecology. The Aymara of highland Bolivia have long used varieties of potato containing potentially toxic levels of glycoalkaloids, and Johns proposes that such plants can be eaten without harm owing to human genetic modification and cultural manipulation. Drawing on additional fieldwork in Africa, he considers the evolution of the human use of plants, the ways in which humans obtain foods from among the myriad poisonous and unpalatable plants in the environment, and the consequences of this history for understanding the basis of the human diet. A natural corollary to his investigation is the origin of medicine, since the properties of plants that make them unpalatable and toxic are the same properties that make them useful pharmacologically. As our species has adapted to the use of plants, plants have become an essential part of our internal ecology. Recovering the ancient wisdom regarding our interaction with the environment preserves a fundamental part of our human heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DKXkvQcZlIsC&dq=Human+Medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valkyrie Profile: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","description":"Set in the world of Norse mythology, \\"Valkyrie Profile\\" features the goddess Valkyrie, who must collect the souls of fallen warriors and train them for battle in a war between the gods.

An entire generation of sports fans has grown up seeing Venus and Serena Williams as the gold standard in American professional tennis.

Based on evidence in the literature and real-life casestudies, this book examines the validity of those claims. The authorsdiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of using e-mail and the Web toconduct research surveys, and also offer practical suggestions for designing and implementing Internet surveys most effectively.Among other findings, the authors determined that Internet surveys may bepreferable to mail or telephone surveys when a list of e-mail addresses forthe target population is available, thus eliminating the need for mail orphone invitations to potential respondents. Internet surveys also arewell-suited for larger survey efforts and for some target populations thatare difficult to reach by traditional survey methods. Web surveys areconducted more quickly than mail or phone surveys when respondents arecontacted initially by e-mail, as is often the case when a representativepanel of respondents has been assembled in advance. And, although surveysincur virtually no coding or data-entry costs because the data are capturedelectronically, the labor costs for design and programming can be high.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dyJMxgV7JScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Be or Not to Be Intimidated?: That is the Question","description":"In candid terms the book explains what intimidation is, why you become intimidated, and how you can avoid the mental lapses that can cause even the most successful people to sometimes fall victim to intimidation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UtB0S6LOl-oC&dq=To+Be+or+Not+to+Be+Intimidated%3F:+That+is+the+Question&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GibbsCAM Tutorial Versions 2000 & 2002","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1PYJAAAACAAJ&dq=GibbsCAM+Tutorial+Versions+2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Polish Cuisine","description":"The food of Poland has long been overlooked, but the time is right for a reinvention.

Traditional EMC design practices have been simply rule-based, that is, a list of rules-of-thumb are presented to the board designers to implement. When a particular rule-of-thumb is difficult to implement, it is often ignored. After the product is built, it will often fail emission requirements and various time consuming and costly add-ons are then required. Proper EMC design does not require advanced degrees from universities, nor does it require strenuous mathematics. It does require a basic understanding of the underlying principles of the potential causes of EMC emissions. With this basic understanding, circuit board designers can make trade-off decisions during the design phase to ensure optimum EMC design. Consideration of these potential sources will allow the design to pass the emissions requirements the first time in the test laboratory. A number of other books have been published on EMC. Most are general books on EMC and do not focus on printed circuit board is intended to help EMC engineers and design design. This book engineers understand the potential sources of emissions and how to reduce, control, or eliminate these sources. This book is intended to be a 'hands-on' book, that is, designers should be able to apply the concepts in this book directly to their designs in the real-world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eIbdBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Allure","description":"Toxic leaders, both political, like Slobodan Milosevic, and corporate, like Enron's Ken Lay, have always been with us, and many books have been written to explain what makes them tick. Here leadership scholar Jean Lipman-Blumen explains what makes the followers tick, exploring why people will tolerate--and remain loyal to--leaders who are destructive to their organizations, their employees, or their nations. Why do we knowingly follow, seldom unseat, frequently prefer, and sometimes even create toxic leaders? Lipman-Blumen argues that these leaders appeal to our deepest needs, playing on our anxieties and fears, on our yearnings for security, high self-esteem, and significance, and on our desire for noble enterprises and immortality. She also explores how followers inadvertently keep themselves in line by a set of insidious control myths that they internalize. For example, the belief that the leader must necessarily be in a position to \\"know more\\" than the followers often stills their objections. In addition, outside forces--such as economic depressions, political upheavals, or a crisis in a company--can increase our anxiety and our longing for charismatic leaders. Lipman-Blumen shows how followers can learn critical lessons for the future and survive in the meantime. She discusses how to confront, reform, undermine, blow the whistle on, or oust a toxic leader. And she suggests how we can diminish our need for strong leaders, identify \\"reluctant leaders\\" among competent followers, and even nurture the leader within ourselves. Toxic leaders charm, manipulate, mistreat, weaken, and ultimately devastate their followers. The Allure of Toxic Leaders tells us how to recognize these leaders before it's too late.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ttklIpRQxsQC&dq=Allure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics (Italian Texts and Studies on Religion and Society)","description":"\\"The book is made even more valuable by the inclusion of an extensive anthology of translated Mandaean texts, complete with notes.

En net als de vele andere frameworks is het bedoeld om te helpen bij het beschrijven van vraagstukken en het testen van mogelijke oplossingen. DID is anders dan de andere frameworks en managementmodellen; het is onafhankelijk van ieder ander framework of model en het pretendeert niet om het totale ontwerp van business informatie services te omvatten. DID legt relaties met andere nuttige en wijdverbreide best practices die specifiek zijn ontwikkeld om toe te passen in specifieke fasen van de ontwikkeling van business informatie services. Zoals tijdens de idee-vorming, conceptontwikkeling, specificatie, ontwerp, test, oplevering, servicemanagement en operatie, of bij het ontwikkelen en beheren van architectuurvraagstukken of bij de implementatie van hardware en software. DID is in eerste instantie bedoeld om te sturen op de kwaliteit van informatie, en om te zorgen dat deze informatie effectief wordt ingezet. Het DID framework is ontwikkeld om te helpen tijdens het ontwerp van business informatie services om te bepalen wat je nodig hebt, en wanneer je het nodig hebt. DID kan ook worden gebruikt als een handleiding bij het bepalen welke delen van andere bestaande frameworks nuttig kunnen zijn. DID is volledig onafhankelijk van andere frameworks (zoals BiSL and BiSL Next, waarvan DID is afgeleid). Je bepaalt zelf wat je wel of niet toepast. DID helpt om die keuze te onderbouwen en om vast te stellen wat de sterke en zwakke punten zijn van je aanpak. Het DID framework is gebaseerd op de meest gangbare concepten om kernelementen van een ontwerpaanpak te beschrijven (behoefte en waarde, missie en vermogen), de belangrijkste perspectieven op business informatie (business, informatie/data, services en technologie) en de dominante domeinen (governance, strategie, verbetering en operatie). Effectief sturen op deze aspecten draagt bij aan goed functionerende organisaties. DID helpt om precies dat te onderscheiden wat je nodig hebt om te realiseren dat jouw ontwerp van business informatie beantwoordt aan de wensen in jouw organisatie. DID kan volledig onafhankelijk van andere frameworks worden toegepast en het kan in alle lagen van de organisatie worden ingezet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZWEtEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You live after death,","description":"After centuries of being taboo, the subject of our survival of death has once again become popular.

This celebrated Picaresque novel is a 1931 Harlem Renaissance era satire on American race relations. Schuyler targets both the KKK and NAACP in condemning the ways in which race functions as both an obsession and a commodity in early twentieth-century America. The central premise of the novel is that an African American scientist invents a process that can transform blacks into whites. Those who have internalized white racism, those who are tired of inferior opportunities socially and economically, and those who simply want to expand their sexual horizons, line up to be transformed. As the country \\"whitens,\\" the economic importance of racial segregation in the South as a means of maintaining elite white economic and social status becomes increasingly apparent. The novel is known not only for its satiric bite and inventive plot machinations, but also for the caricatures of prominent figures of the American 1920s including W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, James Weldon Johnson, C. J. Walker and others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OGoWrgEACAAJ&dq=Black+No+More:+Being+an+Account+of+the+Strange+and+Wonderful+Workings+of+Science+in+the+Land+of+the+Free,+A.+D.+1933-1940,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Create Your Family History Book with Family Tree Maker Version 8 : The Official Guide (Miscellaneous) (v. 8)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FKZUAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Pocket Dictionary","description":"Aimed at all learners of French from beginner to intermediate level as well as holidaymakers and business travellers, the 'Chambers French Pocket Dictionary' is an essential compact, portable reference tool.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xyjzQwAACAAJ&dq=French+Pocket+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gender in Popular Culture: Images of Men and Women in Literature, Visual Media and Material Culture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bgKaAAAAIAAJ&dq=Gender+in+Popular+Culture:+Images+of+Men+and+Women+in+Literature,+Visual+Media+and+Material+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sermons for the times, (The works of Charles Kingsley)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tQ_fngEACAAJ&dq=Sermons+for+the+times,+(The+works+of+Charles+Kingsley)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Babylon Sisters","description":"Catherine Sanderson seems to have it all: a fulfilling career helping immigrant women find jobs, a lovely home, and a beautiful, intelligent daughter on her way to Smith College.

Intended for statisticians and non-statisticians alike, the theoretical treatment is elementary, with heuristics often replacing detailed mathematical proof. Most aspects of extreme modeling techniques are covered, including historical techniques (still widely used) and contemporary techniques based on point process models. A wide range of worked examples, using genuine datasets, illustrate the various modeling procedures and a concluding chapter provides a brief introduction to a number of more advanced topics, including Bayesian inference and spatial extremes. All the computations are carried out using S-PLUS, and the corresponding datasets and functions are available via the Internet for readers to recreate examples for themselves. An essential reference for students and researchers in statistics and disciplines such as engineering, finance and environmental science, this book will also appeal to practitioners looking for practical help in solving real problems. Stuart Coles is Reader in Statistics at the University of Bristol, UK, having previously lectured at the universities of Nottingham and Lancaster. In 1992 he was the first recipient of the Royal Statistical Society's research prize.

In this penetrating historical study, Jeffrey Brooks draws on years of research into the most influential and widely circulated Russian newspapers--including Pravda, Isvestiia, and the army paper Red Star--to explain the origins, the nature, and the effects of this unrelenting idealization of the state, the Communist Party, and the leader. Brooks shows how, beginning with Lenin, the Communists established a state monopoly of the media that absorbed literature, art, and science into a stylized and ritualistic public culture--a form of political performance that became its own reality and excluded other forms of public reflection. He presents and explains scores of self-congratulatory newspaper articles, including tales of Stalin's supposed achievements and virtue, accounts of the country's allegedly dynamic economy, and warnings about the decadence and cruelty of the capitalist West. Brooks pays particular attention to the role of the press in the reconstruction of the Soviet cultural system to meet the Nazi threat during World War II and in the transformation of national identity from its early revolutionary internationalism to the ideology of the Cold War. He concludes that the country's one-sided public discourse and the pervasive idea that citizens owed the leader gratitude for the \\"gifts\\" of goods and services led ultimately to the inability of late Soviet Communism to diagnose its own ills, prepare alternative policies, and adjust to new realities. The first historical work to explore the close relationship between language and the implementation of the Stalinist-Leninist program, Thank You, Comrade Stalin! is a compelling account of Soviet public culture as reflected through the country's press.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YugSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Comedy of Redemption: Christian Faith & Comic Vision in Four American Novelists","description":"Balancing theology with literary criticism, this work explores the comic vision in the works of four American novelists, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, John Updike and Peter De Vries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=natZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Comedy+of+Redemption:+Christian+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ACS Style Guide: Effective Communication of Scientific Information (An American Chemical Society Publication)","description":"A little more than seventy-five years ago, Kate L. Turabian drafted a set of guidelines to help students understand how to write, cite, and formally submit research writing. Seven editions and more than nine million copies later, the name Turabian has become synonymous with best practices in research writing and style. Her Manual for Writers continues to be the gold standard for generations of college and graduate students in virtually all academic disciplines. Now in its eighth edition, A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations has been fully revised to meet the needs of today s writers and researchers. The Manual retains its familiar three-part structure, beginning with an overview of the steps in the research and writing process, including formulating questions, reading critically, building arguments, and revising drafts. Part II provides an overview of citation practices with detailed information on the two main scholarly citation styles (notes-bibliography and author-date), an array of source types with contemporary examples, and detailed guidance on citing online resources. The final section treats all matters of editorial style, with advice on punctuation, capitalization, spelling, abbreviations, table formatting, and the use of quotations. Style and citation recommendations have been revised throughout to reflect the sixteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style. With an appendix on paper format and submission that has been vetted by dissertation officials from across the country and a bibliography with the most up-to-date listing of critical resources available, A Manual for Writers remains the essential resource for students and their teachers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fqkgAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+ACS+Style+Guide:+Effective+Communication+of+Scientific+Information+(An+American+Chemical+Society+Publication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parks Portrayed in Pen and Paint: Book/DVD Set","description":"De lange weg naar de vrijheid is de beroemde autobiografie van een van de grootste mannen van de twintigste eeuw.

Her voice is the voice you hear when your ear is pressed to the closed door of another's life.  [A] searing memoir . . . Wefali spares no one in this indelible account . . . and her singular voice haunted, angry, passionate recalls Shirley Jackson's.  The New Yorker Amine Wefali moved to the attic of her Westchester home while her husband of thirty years slept downstairs. This estrangement is the subject of Wefali's singular memoir that parts the curtain on the intimate stage of contemporary marriage. In a work marked for its restraint as much as for its insight, Wefali enters John Cheever territory through a series of razor-sharp vignettes. With the instinct of a born writer she transforms ordinary events into brilliant set pieces about the relations between men and women, husband and wife. A family secret is revealed on the way to her children's riding lesson, a conversation with a neighbor becomes a parable on the loss of love. A witty, irreverent woman of Russian descent, Wefali was a bemused outsider in the rarefied environment in which she lived. Anchored by her four children she remained, even as she was complicit in the erosion of her marriage. Restless and torn, she channeled her energy into her home, her garden, her writing. Another man enters her life. Her marriage, finally, fails. Praise for Westchester Burning  How haunting this spare story is written with such clear lines that no one will be able to avoid its power. Here is a truly gifted writer who bores in where others might look away.  Anne Roiphe, author of 1185 Park Avenue  Like any spectacular disaster, [Westchester Burning is] nearly impossible to look away from. . . .

Rutherford Calhoun, a puckish rogue and newly freed slave, spends his days loitering around the docks of New Orleans, dodging debt collectors, gangsters, and Isadora Bailey, a prim and frugal woman who seeks to marry him and curb his mischievous instincts. When the heat from these respective pursuers becomes too much to bear, he cons his way on to the next ship leaving the dock: the Republic. Upon boarding, to his horror he discovers that he is on an illegal slave ship embarking on the Middle Passage, the portion of the triangular trade route that saw slaves transported from Africa to the US. Staffed by a crew of criminals and degenerates, the Republic is on a mission to enslave members of the legendary Allmuseri tribe, while the sadistic yet philosophical Captain Falcon has a secondary objective: securing a mysterious cargo that possesses a terrifying and otherworldly power. What follows is a story of Rutherford s battle for survival, as he finds himself juggling loyalties between the ship s crew and the enslaved passengers, and is forced to use every ounce of the charm and cunning that he possesses to endure the desperate conditions and battle the myriad deadly forces on the high seas. A masterful blend of allegory, black comedy, naval adventure and supernatural horror, Charles Johnson's wildly inventive Middle Passage is a true modern classic. Part of the Picador Collection, a series showcasing the best of modern literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8yBGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Put Me in a Nursing Home","description":"Enjoying their golden years should be an option for every elder.

Early attempts to move beyond the restriction of God-language to 'Father' language and to open up the possibilities of a more inclusive way of praying have led to a richness and variety of experiences of God and the world of the sacred. God experienced in the struggle for justice is one such area. While similarities and connections are shown between, for example, Jewish, womanist, and Latin American women, their distinctiveness and diversity is respected. Women's experience of God does not flinch from ambiguity and tragedy; so long as the figure of Sophia, Wisdom, integrates new dimensions of experience the infinite depths of the Divine Mystery are still to be plumbed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OQYRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Introducing+Feminist+Images+of+God+(Introductions+in+Feminist+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Securing E-Business Systems: A Guide for Managers and Executives","description":"The essential guide to e-business security for managers and ITprofessionals Securing E-Business Systems provides business managers andexecutives with an overview of the components of an effectivee-business infrastructure, the areas of greatest risk, and bestpractices safeguards.

Anyone who has browsed through the 'Computing' section of a bookshop (assuming it has one) will not need much convincing that there are a lot of C++ books out there. So why add yet another to the shelf! This book attempts to introduce you to the C++ language via computer graphics because the object-oriented programming features of C++ naturally lend themselves to graphics. Thus, this book is based around a central theme: computer graphics and the development of 'real' object-oriented tools for graphical modelling. This approach is adopted (as opposed to learning by small, unrelated, often hypothetical, examples) because I didn't want to introduce C++ as a collection oflanguage features. While introducing the syntax and features of C++, it is just as important to demonstrate simultaneously the reason for such features and when to apply them - in otherwords,language and design are given equal priority.

This diverse collection of poems and companion essays by forty nationally and internationally known poets allows readers to experience the creative process through the eyes and voice of each poet. No matter how often we are told that revision is an essential component of poetic composition, it can be difficult to resist the temptation to think of the poem as having sprung spontaneously, Athena-like, from the writer?s head. By exposing readers to the finished product as well as the poet?s own account of the poem?s creation, Making Poems offers a behind-the-scenes perspective on the poetic process that will fascinate both beginning and established writers. The book also affords poetry instructors an opportunity to demonstrate to their students the ways in which poems can originate from seemingly mundane and unlikely sources. ?A valuable addition to one?s personal library for all writers and readers of poetry, this anthology finds its rightful position among the tradition of entertaining and enlightening books in which authors discuss poetic craft or the creative process with a cogent blend of practical wisdom and refreshing clarity.? ? Edward Byrne ?This collection is a gift to creative writing classrooms everywhere. Rather than literal explanations of the text, these are fascinating explorations of the creative process, achieving the intimacy of a live reading.? ?

And why did Deepti tell both her husband and Anderson she was carrying their baby?

(College ESL)","description":"In recent years, the number of nonnative speakers of English in colleges and universities in North America has increased dramatically. As a result, more and more writing teachers have found themselves working with these English as a Second Language (ESL) students in writing classes that are designed primarily with monolingual, native-English-speaking students in mind. Since the majority of institutions require these students to enroll in writing courses at all levels, it is becoming increasingly important for all writing teachers to be aware of the presence and special linguistic and cultural needs of ESL writers. This increase in the ESL population has, over the last 40 years, been paralleled by a similar growth in research on ESL writing and writing instruction--research that writing teachers need to be familiar with in order to work effectively with ESL writers in writing classrooms of all levels and types. Until recently, however, this body of knowledge has not been very accessible to writing teachers and researchers who do not specialize in second language research and instruction. This volume is an attempt to remedy this problem by providing a sense of how ESL writing scholarship has evolved over the last four decades. It brings together 15 articles that address various issues in second language writing in general and ESL writing in particular. In selecting articles for inclusion, the editors tried to take a principled approach. The articles included in this volume have been chosen from a large database of publications in second language writing. The editors looked for works that mirrored the state of the art when they were published and made a conscious effort to represent a wide variety of perspectives, contributions, and issues in the field. To provide a sense of the evolution of the field, this collection is arranged in chronological order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pZHhAQAAQBAJ&dq=Write+Soon!+(College+ESL)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Israelis: Founders and Sons","description":"A REISSUE OF THIS PERSONAL AND POETIC ACCOUNT OF THE MANY HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL FORCES THAT LED TO THE FOUNDING OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, AND AN EXPLORATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF IDENTITY THAT THE SONS OF MODERN ISRAEL FACE-- RACIAL, RELIGIOUS, AND POLITICAL.

Born in Chicago in 1888 but raised in Victorian England, Chandler was publishing poetry in London literary magazines when he set out at twenty-four for California and a business career. Two decades later he held the directorship of a lucrative oil conglomerate, until heavy drinking ended all that. Forced to return to professional writing for his livelihood, with artistic aspirations Chandler began writing detective stories in the hard-boiled style of Dashiell Hammett for popular pulp magazines. Then, in 1939, he published The Big Sleep, and the world met the slick, wisecracking sleuth Philip Marlowe in a decadent, glamorous Los Angeles rife with gangsters, crooked politicians, and dissolute movie queens. Amply illustrated with personal photographs and with reproductions of manuscript pages, letters, print ads, movie promotions, dust jackets, and paperback covers, this volume follows Chandler s career from his early pulp fiction to his classic detective novels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i2ZfHAAACAAJ&dq=Raymond+Chandler:+A+Literary+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Buying Foreclosures","description":"One person's loss is another person's gain.

In Occupied America, Donald F. Johnson chronicles the everyday experience of ordinary people living under military occupation during the American Revolution. Focusing on day-to-day life in port cities held by the British Army, Johnson recounts how men and women from a variety of backgrounds navigated harsh conditions, mitigated threats to their families and livelihoods, took advantage of new opportunities, and balanced precariously between revolutionary and royal attempts to secure their allegiance. Between 1775 and 1783, every large port city along the Eastern seaboard fell under British rule at one time or another. As centers of population and commerce, these cities Boston, New York, Newport, Philadelphia, Savannah, Charleston should have been bastions from which the empire could restore order and inspire loyalty. Military rule's exceptional social atmosphere initially did provide opportunities for many people especially women and the enslaved, but also free men both rich and poor to reinvent their lives, and while these opportunities came with risks, the hope of social betterment inspired thousands to embrace military rule. Nevertheless, as Johnson demonstrates, occupation failed to bring about a restoration of imperial authority, as harsh material circumstances forced even the most loyal subjects to turn to illicit means to feed and shelter themselves, while many maintained ties to rebel camps for the same reasons. As occupations dragged on, most residents no longer viewed restored royal rule as a viable option. As Johnson argues, the experiences of these citizens reveal that the process of political change during the Revolution occurred not in a single instant but gradually, over the course of years of hardship under military rule that forced Americans to grapple with their allegiance in intensely personal and highly contingent ways. Thus, according to Johnson, the quotidian experience of military occupation directly affected the outcome of the American Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-xH2DwAAQBAJ&dq=Life+in+Occupied+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remember This!: Dakota Decolonization and the Eli Taylor Narratives (Contemporary Indigenous Issues)","description":"Situating Dakota language and oral tradition within the framework of decolonization, Remember This!

Taylor lived on the Sioux Valley Reserve in Manitoba, Canada, and was adopted into Wilson?s family in 1988. He agreed to tell her his story and to share his accounts of the origins, history, and life ways of the Dakotas. In these pages he tells of Dakota history, the United States?Dakota Conflict of 1862, Dakota values, and the mysterious powers of the world. Wilson gracefully contextualizes and complements Taylor's stories with a careful analysis and distillation of the narratives. Additionally, she provides an overview of Dakota history and a substantial critique of the use of oral accounts by mainstream historians. ? By placing Dakota oral tradition within the academic discipline of history, this powerful book illuminates the essential connections among Dakota language, history, and contemporary identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pWffjI55MyQC&dq=Remember+This!:+Dakota+Decolonization+and+the+Eli+Taylor+Narratives+(Contemporary+Indigenous+Issues)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Way But God's Way","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1XjOBC1HeQ4C&dq=No+Way+But+God%27s+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spring Music (Sound)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DnkJAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Nap: A Chet Gecko Mystery","description":"Grammar school it's all about eating and sleeping.

When striving for success, I observed how some people became successful while others made no progress. Over the last few years, I have experienced many changes in my lifestyle, most of which I would have preferred to avoid. Yet these very experiences have enabled me to wrestle with life and observe many things from outside the normal light, a glimpse of life from a new window, enabling me to observe other peoples lives and giving me a greater understanding of why, although most people dream, they dont achieve a life of fulfillment. I always have been fascinated by previous civilizations, nations, and races, with their different cultures, traditions, and beliefs. How they lived at a personal level. During my life, as I travelled through different countries and met the inhabitants, I noticed that many people drift through life on a day-to-day basis, living a way of life with no purpose other than to stay alive for as long as possible. This lack of ambition makes me feel that lives are being wasted, hence the incentive to do something about it; if this book achieves a change for the better for only one life, I feel I will have contributed something positive to society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Au5lCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Una guia maestra para la meditacion y el crescimento espiritual","description":"El presente libro est  compuesto por cuatro cap tulos: \\"\\"Escuchando la voz interior\\"\\", \\"\\"El  xtasis m stico\\"\\", \\"\\"La esperanza del misterio\\"\\" y \\"\\"Versos espirituales\\"\\".

In this chatty, free-ranging cultural survey, Sears (Growing Up Gay in the South) presents a vivid kaleidoscope of the mores and political activities of many gay Southerners following the 1969 Stonewall riots and leading up to the 1979 march on Washington. Sears unspools this history through portraits of activists and community organizers including Merril Mushroom, Jack Nichols, Lige Clark, Vicki Gabriner, Minnie Bruce Pratt and Sgt. Leonard Matlovitch who helped shape the social and political climate below the Mason Dixon line and often in the rest of the country. While giving a nod to historic events like Anita Bryant's Save Our Children campaign, Sears focuses more closely on obscure but important local political events, like the founding of the lesbian journal Sinister Wisdom, the emergence of the Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance and community response to a deadly firebombing that killed 31 patrons in a New Orleans bar in the mid-1970s. Sears's multifaceted approach pays off when he sketches such relatively unknown players as comedian Ray Bourbon and radical fairy Faygele ben Miriam, and he conveys well the complexity and intensity of the political activity of the decade. While not as historically conclusive or theoretically astute as John Howard's masterful Men Like That (2000), Sears provides a panoply of emotionally riveting snapshots that aptly portray Southern gay experience in the 1970s.

Tenzij gehoor wordt gegeven aan de boodschap die in de piramides van Mexico en Egypte en de lijnen van Nazca in Peru verborgen ligt. De enige die hiervan op de hoogte is, is Mick Gabriel, de getraumatiseerde zoon van Julius. Mick zit al jaren gedwongen opgesloten in een psychiatrische inrichting en probeert tevergeefs duidelijk te maken welke ramp de mensheid te wachten staat. Dominique Vazquez, die stage loopt in de inrichting, raakt er langzaam maar zeker van overtuigd dat Mick de waarheid spreekt. Ze negeert daarbij de waarschuwing dat ze met een gevaarlijke gek te maken heeft. Ze helpt hem zelfs uit de inrichting te ontsnappen en gaat er samen met hem vandoor. Dan is het niet langer de vraag of, maar h   moet worden voorkomen dat de profetie van de Mayakalender in vervulling zal gaan...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EMovAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Middle-Aged Man and the Sea","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nz0SQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Middle-Aged+Man+and+the+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete CardioKickboxing","description":"Demonstrates high-energy techniques for a cardio-workout, including punching, kicking, blocking, and footwork","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nXPSNwAACAAJ&dq=Complete+CardioKickboxing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Metal Casting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oPhTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fundamentals+of+Metal+Casting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Look What Came From China (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Describes many things, both familiar and unfamiliar, that originally came from China, including inventions, food, tools, animals, toys, games, musical instruments, fashion, medicine, holidays, and sports.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pmXWPQAACAAJ&dq=Look+What+Came+From+China+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electrostatic Experiments: An Encyclopedia of Early Electrostatic Experiments, Demonstrations, Devices, and Apparatus","description":"Originally published in the middle of the nineteenth century under the title Electrical Experiments, this book describes practically all basic electrostatic experiments, demonstrations, devices, and apparatus performed and invented since the time when the first electrostatic effects were noticed in antiquity up to about 1850. The book is unique in its comprehensiveness and provides the essential details for replicating over 400 electrostatic experiments and for reconstructing numerous electrostatic devices.Unfortunately, as is frequently the case with older books, the original editions of Franciss Electrical Experiments belong to the category of rare books hardly accessible now even to research scientists, to say nothing of students, teachers, engineers, amateur scientists, inventors, patent lawyers, and anyone else who may be interested in electrical science and in electrostatics in particular. And yet, the utility of Franciss book to a wide circle of readers is even greater now than when the book was first written because electrostatics has now become a very practical science with many useful applications, and therefore for many persons a familiarity with its basic principles and techniques is now truly important.The purpose of the present edition of Franciss remarkable work is to make it readily available, easily noticeable, and appealing to as wide a circle of present-day readers interested in electrostatics as possible.To achieve the second of these three goals, the title of the book has been changed from Electrical Experiments to Electrostatic Experiments. The word electrical in the original title, perfectly appropriate in the middle of the nineteenth century when the book was first published, is misleading to present-day readers: the book deals exclusively with electrostatics, whereas electrical is now mostly understood as something relating to the electric current. Furthermore, the word encyclopedia has been incorporated in the subtitle of the book. The scope of the book is truly encyclopedic, and to call it encyclopedia is perfectly justified.To achieve the last of the above-mentioned goals, the book is printed in an entirely new format. Originally the book was printed in a very small typeface, was difficult to read, and its typographic quality was very poor. The illustrations (wood engravings) were very small. The present format is designed for easy readability and pleasing visual appearance. The book is now printed in 11 points Century Schoolbook typeface one of the most readable typefaces in existence. All 148 wood engravings originally contained in the book are enlarged. Both the paperback edition and the hardcover edition are printed on high quality paper. For better durability and ease of use the signatures are sawn together. The hardcover edition is bound in Skyvertex? -- a synthetic leather-like material.Some words and terms used in the book have now either disappeared from the English language or have acquired a different meaning. Therefore the book has been now supplemented by a glossary explaining the most obscure or ambiguous words appearing in the book. Furthermore, taking into account that the most convenient presently-known generator of static electricity for performing electrostatic experiments is the Wimshursts influence machine, invented some thirty years after the publication of Franciss book, the book has been supplemented by a description of this machine. Finally, the book has been supplemented by some literature references.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yoPoAAAACAAJ&dq=Electrostatic+Experiments:+An+Encyclopedia+of+Early+Electrostatic+Experiments,+Demonstrations,+Devices,+and+Apparatus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handling Mr. Hyde","description":"Millions of people in the United States suffer from the devastating, stigmatizing mental illness called manic depression. Much of the care they receive from their doctors is ineffective. Much of the information they receive about their medications is misleading. Furthermore, their loved ones are not allowed information even though they are critical in assisting the patient cope with the disease. Handling Mr. Hyde is intended to help patients and their loved ones understand these issues and a myriad of other ones that are associated with this disease that extend well beyond medicine to virtually every aspect of life. It is most helpful if read initially upon diagnosis, or even suspicion of the illness, by the patient, the family, or friends. Half of the chapters are written in a question and answer format that allows readers to directly find guidance regarding their most significant concerns as if the authors were discussing it with them. The other chapters are essays on topics that are treated in greater depth than the question and answer format permits. The book is unique in that it is written from three perspectives: the patient, who also has the point of view and expertise of a physician, and a member of his family. SAK is a physician who has had residency training in internal medicine, neurology and psychiatry. In addition, both authors have doctorate degrees (SAK in physiology and IMK in mechanical engineering) providing advanced scientific training. The philosophy of the answers are based on the common sense and stoicism gained by experience, backed by the scientific, economic, and social insight gained by learning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zY_5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Closers: Great American Writers on the Art of Selling","description":"Selling may be the defining activity of our society.

Along with her contemporary Defoe, she did more than any other writer to create a market for fiction prior to the emergence of Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett. Also one of Augustan England's most popular authors, Haywood came to fame in 1719 with the publication of her first novel, Love in Excess. In addition to writing fiction, she was a playwright, translator, bookseller, actress, theater critic, and editor of The Female Spectator, the first English periodical written by women for women. Though tremendously popular, her novels and plays from the 1720s and 30s scandalized the reading public with explicit portrayals of female sexuality and led others to call her \\"the Great Arbitress of Passion.\\" Essays in this collection explore themes such as the connections between Haywood's early and late work, her experiments with the form of the novel, her involvement in party politics, her use of myth and plot devices, and her intense interest in the imbalance of power between men and women. Distinguished scholars such as Paula Backschieder, Felicity Nussbaum, and John Richetti approach Haywood from a number of theoretical and topical positions, leading the way in a crucial reexamination of her work. The Passionate Fictions of Eliza Haywood examines the formal and ideological complexities of her prose and demonstrates how Haywood's texts deft traditional schematization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=80sgEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lightwave 3d Applied: Version 5.6","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nzqzzQEACAAJ&dq=Lightwave+3d+Applied:+Version+5.6&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Coastal Wilderness to Fruited Plain: A History of Environmental Change in Temperate North America from 1500 to the Present","description":"Fascinating account of the landscape changes following European settlement of North America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fqxv-wB0ZwIC&dq=From+Coastal+Wilderness+to+Fruited+Plain:+A+History+of+Environmental+Change+in+Temperate+North+America+from+1500+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadow castle,","description":"In the middle of a deep forest is an enchanted valley and a castle where only shadows live, shadows of kings and queens who have waited for hundreds of years for the spell cast upon them to be broken.

He sailed aboard SS Dryad from New York harbour on 15 May 1879 and reached Sydney on September 3.... The 'Americanisation' of Sydney, according to some observers, dated from Loughry's arrival with the Baldwin trains.\\"  from American Steam on Australian Rails Railways, according to the history books, were a British invention, and as a result, English companies were quick to capture a huge part of the world market. So how did American steam locomotives come to play a major role in rail transportation in 19th-century Australia, then a British colony? In American Steam on Australian Rails, David Burke tells the fascinating story of Yankee ingenuity and the companies that challenged an English monopoly. While purchasers of equipment for Australian lines argued about the virtues and failings of the American machine, most had to admit that the engines made for the Wild West worked equally well riding the curves, grades, and light rails of outback Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales. Burke provides copious descriptions of the locomotives themselves, from early models with ornate domes, long cowcatchers, and wooden cabs, right through to the trim 59 class 2-8-2 imported from Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton by New South Wales in the twilight of steam. Lavishly illustrated with color and black-and-white photos and illustrations, American Steam on Australian Rails documents the progress of hundreds of Yankee engines across the vastness of a new continent as they became part of a grand Australian railroad adventure.

Exhaustively researched and critically acclaimed, Scott Ellsworth s Death in a Promised Land is the definitive account of the Tulsa race riot and its aftermath, in which much of the history of the destruction and violence was covered up. It is the compelling story of racial ideologies, southwestern politics, and incendiary journalism, and of an embattled black community s struggle to hold onto its land and freedom. More than just the chronicle of one of the nation s most devastating racial pogroms, this critically acclaimed study of American race relations is, above all, a gripping story of terror and lawlessness, and of courage, heroism, and human perseverance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u9SlbjZHeHgC&dq=Death+in+a+Promised+Land:+The+Tulsa+Race+Riot+of+1921&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roughing It Easy 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UsR6zQEACAAJ&dq=Roughing+It+Easy+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver 4 from A to Z: A Quick Reference of More Than 300 Dreamweaver Tasks, Terms and Tricks","description":"Written for any level of Web designer and Web master, this book provides a reference for everyone from students to mobile workers.

Adam meets a mysterious young teaching pro named Wendy who, in seven crisp, short yet profound lessons, teaches him things that seem baffling at first: - You and the ball are one - Find the now, and you will find the shot - Let the game play you From the moment they begin to put these lessons into practice, what was previously a humiliation turns into a transforming experience, not just for Adam's score but for his whole life. Long a famous writer on spiritual subjects, hailed as the poet-philosopher of mind-body medicine, Deepak Chopra found himself fascinated by the game of golf. He could not escape its parallels to life: 'Golf is like lightning caught in a bottle. It can turn triumph into disaster in a split second.' Faced with the wild ups and downs of his own game, Chopra crystallised a teaching based on mindfulness, the ability to remain calm and focused, relaxed and powerful at the same time. Mindfulness can improve any golf game, from the beginner's to the tour professional's.

You are dive-bombing the Japanese battleship Yamato. You are flying in the clouds on instruments -- and they seem to be lying to you. You are in combat and watch your best friend get shot down... These are just a few of the stories in this book, written by the Corsair pilots who lived to tell the tales. All of these stories are true to the writers best recollections and reference material, such as pilot logbooks, squadron history, and accident reports. If youve ever flown a bent wing Corsair, youll find stories here that will bring back memories, and you probably have your own true tales of trial and terror! Or perhaps youre one of the many wannabees that were born too late to fly the World War II warbirds, and youd like to experience some vicarious thrills by reading about those who did. The stories in this book -- all written by me or former Corsair pilots I personally know -- are bits and pieces of recollections from World War II and the Korean War period, when the Chance-Vought F4U and Goodyear FG Corsairs were considered the premier propeller-driven fighters and attack aircraft. Some Corsair history can be found in APPENDIX B. Each of these stories is relatively stand-alone, not depending on previous stories, so some facts may be repeated. No particular chronological sequence is used, so you can pick up the book, flip it open and read any tale without wondering if youve missed an important earlier fact. And if you like to read accident reports, there are four of my own (following Chapters 1 and 13), and 19 others in APPENDIX A, all from my Navy fighter squadron (VF-14 Tophatters) in the two years I was with them -- which gives you an idea of how treacherous the Corsair could be! Then, if you are into electronics or computers and want a break from Trial and Terror! you might find some humor in APPENDIX C -- which has nothing whatever to do with Corsairs or flying!

Fusion bonding offers a number of advantages over traditional joining techniques and it is anticipated that its use will increase dramatically in the future because of the rise in the use of thermoplastic matrix composites and the growing necessity for recyclability of engineering assemblies. Fusion Bonding of Polymer Composites provides an in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the fusion bonding process, covering such topics as: - heat transfer in fusion bonding; - modelling thermal degradation; - consolidation mechanisms; - crystallisation kinetics; - processing-microstructure-property relationship; - full-scale fusion bonding; - fusion bonding of thermosetting composite/thermoplastic composite and metal/thermoplastic joints. The book focuses on one practical case study using the resistance welding process. This example exposes the reader to the development of processing windows for a novel manufacturing process including the use of experimental test programmes and modelling strategies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V8zTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Riches of Rangoberra/Las riquezas de Rangoberra (Bilingual)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QkDhAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Riches+of+Rangoberra/Las+riquezas+de+Rangoberra+(Bilingual)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film & History: 26 Years of Scholarly Excellence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SjGqoAEACAAJ&dq=Film&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seems Like Murder Here: Southern Violence and the Blues Tradition","description":"Winner of the 2004 C.

For much of this century, respected social theorists predicted the death of religion as inevitable consequence of science, education, and modern economics. But they were wrong. Stark and Bainbridge set out to explain the survival of religion. Using information derived from numerous surveys, censuses, historical case studies, and ethnographic field expeditions, they chart the full sweep of contemporary religion from the traditional denominations to the most fervent cults. This wealth of information is located within a coherent theoretical framework that examines religion as a social response to human needs, both the general needs shared by all and the desires specific to those who are denied the economic rewards or prestige enjoyed by the privileged. By explaining the forms taken by religions today, Stark and Bainbridge allow us to understand its persistence in a secular age and its prospects for the future,","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lTzPyvT2yusC&dq=The+Future+of+Religion:+Secularization,+Revival+and+Cult+Formation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ministry to Persons With Chronic Illnesses: A Guide to Empowerment Through Negotiation (Guides to Pastoral Care)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HoKSgPAVpQoC&dq=Ministry+to+Persons+With+Chronic+Illnesses:+A+Guide+to+Empowerment+Through+Negotiation+(Guides+to+Pastoral+Care)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mists of Dragon Lore (Toltec Teachings)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hbg9AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mists+of+Dragon+Lore+(Toltec+Teachings)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through a Glass, Darkly: A Commissario Guido Brunetti Mystery","description":"On a luminous spring day in Venice, Commissario Guido Brunetti and Inspector Vianello play hooky to help get Vianello s friend Marco Ribetti--an environmental activist arrested during a protest against toxic waste being dumped into the city s waters--released from prison.

It is intended for students embarking on courses in these subjects and assumes no special knowledge of any science. It is written in a direct and simple style, and technical language is introduced very sparingly. As various perspectives are sketched out in this book, the reader moves towards a consistent conception of contemporary science as a rapidly changing social institution that has already grown out of its traditional forms and plays a central role in society at large. It will appeal to students in a wide range of scientific disciplines and complement well Professor Ziman's earlier books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=loP0v9wRf4gC&dq=Introducing+Science+Studies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Bogosian: Talk Radio, Drinking in America, FunHouse and Men Inside","description":"\\"What Lenny Bruce was to the 1950s, Bob Dylan to the 1960s, Woody Allen to the 1970s--that's what Eric Bogosian is to this frightening moment of drift in our history.\\"--Frank Rich, The New York Times","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NvfoCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wood Beyond the World","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xic7AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],I={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",I,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const x=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-1e8aee77"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/13.md","filePath":"glossary/13.md"}'),J={name:"glossary/13.md"},D=Object.assign(J,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(x)]))}});export{H as __pageData,D as default};
