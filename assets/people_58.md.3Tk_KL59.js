What a whale of a book! what a mess! what great fun!Typee and Omoo were , well, non-fictional accounts of young Melville's travels in the South Pacific. He wrote in the Mardi foreword, that nobody believed him, so he made up some fiction and was sure to be believed this time. Not likely.The book was a flop in the commercial sense, like all future Melville books would be. What an idiot the market can be.The 'story': the hero of the 2 previous adventure tales takes off from an island on a small whaling ship, to go home, and true to his personal tradition, runs away from it, with a fellow sailor in a whaling boat. (The fact that he actually steals the boat in the process, not to mention breaks his contract, seems irrelevant to the young man.)They meet a small and nearly deserted ship, take it over, find an odd couple on it, Samoa and Annatoo, have adventures with them sailing the ship, lose the ship and Annatoo, then the 3 men are again on the boat, they meet some natives in a prao, save a beautiful virgin from human sacrifice. She turns out to be a kind of goddess, so the hero has to promote himself to play in the same league, then they land on the island group called Mardi, and the story gets very long and tedious, but never quite stops being fun. Mardi is supposed to mean the 'world', by the way. See the allegoric meaning?The structure of the short chapters (nearly 200 of them) helps to maintain momentum. The chapters are half way to Moby Dick: some are plain story telling, some are ruminations on God and the World, some are observations of nature, some are the mystical phantasies of the South Seas mythology that M. created for the purpose of this book.And it is a collection of aphorisms, that would make the visit worth while on their own.The whale's brain enlightens the world.Death has a mouth as black as a wolf's.He looked infernally heartless.He who hates is a fool. Yet some dislikes are spontaneous.Some revelations show best in twilight.One of my AFs said that nothing prepares the reader of Typee and Omoo for the Melville of later years. I would add, that Mardi already breaks the barriers. Sometimes he comments on his own text in the text: e.g. ...which sentence reads like a pattering of hailstones.If you can, don't read it without access to Google, otherwise the constant allusions to the world of history and literature make you lose a lot of the contents (unless you are an encyclopedia yourself).P.S. and not to forget, greetings to the hermit goats that they spotted on the island of Massafuero. Wherever that is, if it is anywhere."},{"Title":"Mardi and a voyage thither (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Mardi, the forgotten child ,is yet entirely singular and needs to be read by those who have fallen under the spell of Melville. An encyclopaedic romp through an almost fantastical landscape of isles and warriors; Melville attempts to pull off one the most extraordinary acts of metaphysical fiction ever. He doesn't quite rein it all in but the experience of reading Mardi is utterly disorientating in the best way. Coming after Typee and before Moby Dick, it is somewhat of a nutty middle ground. The anthropological concerns of Typee are stretched to the limit. Like the stars in the sky, Mardi is vast; (the word is Polynesian for the world)--and as full of wonder."},{"Title":"Mardi and a voyage thither (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Although on its surface it appears to be a travelogue like his first two books (TYPEE and OMOO), MARDI is actually much more than that: it's a commentary on the age in which it was written, it's a quest story, it's an allegory, it's a love story. It's about many strange things and is not an easy book to follow, mainly because of Melville's use of allusions and digressions. Like Joyce's ULYSSES it almost requires a guide to help interpret what's in the book. As always with Melville its strength is in its language: the descriptions that are almost like poetry and the \\"borrowings\\" from favorite authors such as Shakespeare and Swift.Basically, the story involves a shipwreck in the South Pacific, an attack by native islanders, and the falling in love of the narrator (Taji) with one of the native woman (Yillah). The make their way to the island of Mardi where they live happily for a while, until Yillah disappears. Taji searches for her throughout the islands with some companions; during this search they discuss many topics (here Melville satirizes life in America and England - slavery, politics, Indian policy, the war with Mexico, and also the failures of Christians to follow the love of Christ), until they find Yillah on an island transformed into a handmaiden. Implored to stay there with her, Taji decides to sail on in his endless quest for . . . truth?The novel sold poorly during Melville's day (the London publisher lost money on it), with the public put off by its utter strangeness. Language lovers will appreciate this novel, however, and perhaps those who enjoy interpreting symbols and allusions. Not an easy book, but worth the effort to get a better picture of what Melville was all about as a great novelist."},{"Title":"Mardi and a voyage thither (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Anyone who loves Moby Dick and is looking for another Melvillean challenge, buy a copy of &quot;Mardi and a Voyage Thither&quot;. Alas! many marvels await thee whosoever has the time and fortitude to muse through this early Melville Masterpiece! Reading this novel is like watching Melville's genius grow, while you voyage through his mystical, metaphysical world. The following are some excerpts of what to expect on this joyous journey:&quot;We are off! The courses and topsails are set: the coral-hung anchor swings from the bow; and together, the three royals are given to the breeze, that follows us out to sea like the baying of a hound. Out spreads the canvas -- alow, aloft -- boom-stretched, on both sides, with many a stun' sail; till like a hawk, with pinions poised, we shadow the sea with our sails, and reelingly cleave the brine.&quot;&quot;But how fleeting our joys. Storms follow bright dawnings. -Long memories of short-lived scenes, sad thoughts of joyous hours -how common are ye to all mankind. When happy, do we pause and say - \\"Lo, thy felicity, my soul?\\" No: happiness seldom seems happiness, except when looked back upon from woes. A flowery landscape, you must come out of, to behold.&quot;&quot;For there is more likelihood of being overrated while living, than of being underrated when dead. And to insure your fame, you must die.&quot;&quot;My cheek blanches white while I write; I start at the scratch of my pen; my own mad brood of eagles devours me; fain would I unsay this audacity; but an iron-mailed hand clenches mine in a vice, and prints down every letter in my spite. Fain would I hurl off this Dionysius that rides me; my thoughts crush me down till I groan; in far fields I hear the song of the reaper, while I slave and faint in this cell. The fever runs through me like lava; my hot brain burns like a coal; and like many a monarch, I am less to be envied, than the veriest hind in the land.&quot;&quot;Of the highest order of genius, it may be truly asserted, that to gain the reputation of superior power, it must partially disguise itself; it must come down, and then it will be applauded for soaring...that there are those who falter in the common tongue, because they think in another; and these are accounted stutterers and stammerers.&quot;&quot;The catalogue of true thoughts is but small; they are ubiquitous; no man's property; and unspoken, or bruited, are the same. When we hear them, why seem they so natural, receiving our spontaneous approval? why do we think we have heard them before? Because they but reiterate ourselves; they were in us, before we were born. The truest poets are but mouth-pieces; and some men duplicates of each other;&quot;&quot;Faith is to the thoughtless, doubts to the thinker.&quot;&quot;Some joys have thousand lives; can never die; for when they droop, sweet memories bind them up.&quot;&quot;Now, I am my own soul's emperor; and my first act is abdication! Hail! realm of shades!&quot; -- and turning my prow into the racing tide, which seized me like a hand omnipotent, I darted through. Churned in foam, the outer ocean lashed the clouds; and straight in my white wake, headlong dashed a shallop, three fixed specters leaning o'er its prow: three arrows poising. And thus, pursuers and pursued flew on, over an endless sea.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mardi and a voyage thither (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Mardi is Melville's 3rd book. His first two (Typee and Omoo) were briskly-selling, somewhat fictionalized travelogues of his actual adventures in the South Pacific. Mardi was meant to be another such adventure story, but partway in it takes a sudden turn into fantasy, by venturing into a fictional (and apparently enormous) archipelago of myriad pseudo-Polynesian cultures. Like the Odyssey (or like planets in Star Trek), each island is a place to explore some philosophical/political point from our real world. In fact, during the final 3rd of the sprawling book, these islands become mirrors of our own world's nations, and Melville's criticism of America, especially slavery on the eve of the Civil War, is fascinating.However, Mardi is one of Melville's weakest books. It suffers greatly from a lack of unification, and from serious pacing problems. It can be viewed as a first, muddy attempt at Moby-Dick.But the mud contains so many nuggets of pure gold that I still give it 4 stars. The character Babbalanja (and his demon, Azzageddi) is one of the best in all of Melville's work, and many of the philosophical conversations are worth reading, not least because of the humor that Melville incorporates into them.Unfortunately, this first attempt to write something unique resulted in the derailing of Melville's career, which never really got back on track. He followed it up with two rather conventional (and to him, boring) novels which again drew upon his past as a sailor, before he created his masterwork, Moby-Dick. Unfortunately, none of these nor later books sold well, and after those first two books, Melville was never able to make a living as a writer. But that just shows that even the greats can write bombs, and that numbers of copies sold does not equal quality."},{"Title":"Mardi and a voyage thither (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"After the successful one-two punch of his first books ('Typee' and 'Omoo'), Melville took a little more time to produce his next novel. In the interim, he got married and contributed to journals (he wrote 'Hawthorne and His Mosses' at this time). Unfortunately, when released, 'Mardi' was such a complete critical and financial failure that it single-handedly destroyed his newly-won success as a writer. Melville never recovered his audience after 'Mardi' and, after reading this fiasco, it's not hard to see why.'Mardi' actually starts off very well as a third episode in Melville's South Sea adventures, picking up where 'Omoo' left off. However, the plot is much tighter than in 'Omoo' and far more interesting. In fact, for the first fifth of the book, Melville's definitely bringing his A-game. There is some grandiose phrasing unlike his typically crisp style, but it doesn't detract much. At first.About a fifth of the way into 'Mardi' though, after the characters melodramatically rescue a girl named Yillah from some island priests, the plot collapses. Several chapters ensue that are, quite frankly, pale retreads of the 'island life among the savages' stuff that Melville did much better in his two previous novels. Then Yillah, who has become the main character's squeeze for no apparent reason, disappears. However, since Melville never made her anything more than a two-dimensional presence, I really didn't care about her or the narrator's feelings for her. This left me uninterested as a reader, and effectively diffused Melville's plot. For those interested, Melville's descriptions of Yillah are absolute proof he was gay, especially when you compare these tepid platitudes with the homoerotic, head-over-heels rhapsodies he pens for Jarl ('his Viking'). It's pretty clear who he thought was yummy. But I digress.Not only did the plot collapse, but it was also at this point that Melville's writing turns into amateur, pretentious crap. His prose is slathered with endless mythological allusions and stilted language that strangles his narrative flow and renders anything he is trying to say laughable. He describes Yillah's beauty: 'Of her beauty I say nothing. It was that of a crystal lake in a fathomless wood.' How vague, trite, and random is that? Then there's: 'For oh, Yillah; were you not the earthly semblance of that sweet vision, that haunted my earliest thoughts?' There's page after page of this hoity-toity phrasing, and no viable plot to help you look past it. Much of Mardi, in fact, is directionless, unrelated ramblings sewn together like Frankenstein's monster.A great example of how overgrown Melville's prose had become while he was writing Mardi is in the chapter 'Mardi by Night and Yillah by Day'. The core of this chapter is Melville's beautiful panoramic word painting of the Mardi islands at night, and the poignant emotions such a scene stirs in him. However, the brief description and his emotions are buried within a two page 'chapter' of stilted writing, overwrought metaphor and simile, and adolescent histrionics.You want stilted writing? How about: 'obeying a restless impulse, I stole without into the magical starlight' or 'but how your mild effulgence stings the boding heart.' You want histrionics? How about: 'Am I a murderer, stars?' Or try out this little gem (and try not to laugh): 'Oh stars! oh eyes, that see me, wheresoe'er I roam...tell me Sybils, what I am.' Melville groupies - judging from the other reviews here - are able to excuse anything from the man who wrote Moby Dick. Perhaps Melville had high aspirations for this book but, wake up people! This is pompous sentimental writing that would have made the stereotypical 'lady novelist' pull out her editing pen! Coming from Melville, it's just embarrassing and I felt bad for him.Unfortunately there's more. Throughout Mardi, Melville layers on bombastic (and oftentimes trite) metaphors and similes like a baker using super sugary icing to cover up that his cake isn't all that good. In the brief two page chapter noted above, Melville references Saturn, Indian wigwams, waterfalls, Greek mythology (two or three times), gnomes, and elves sailing on nautilus shells - all in ONE paragraph! This is awful writing however you spin it and, after a dozen chapters like this with no plot or coherent thematic thread, I'd had it!In short, Mardi is unreadable. I am not surprised it was a flop in Melville's time, nor that it single-handedly finished him with the reading public and the critics. Melville realized his error, as well, for his next book - Redburn - was a return to the approach he had use with Typee. Published less than a year after Mardi, it was obviously an attempt to sweep the failure of Mardi under the rug and recapture Melville's public. Unfortunately, the damage was too great and Melville was ignored for the rest of his life. This meant there was no one paying much (if any) attention when he produced a masterpiece in Moby Dick.Although Melville groupies will worship anything the author of Moby Dick wrote, the objective truth is that Mardi is every bit the debacle it is usually painted as, and only Melville's name on the cover keeps it in print. Consider yourself warned!"},{"Title":"Mardi and a voyage thither (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Most people contemplate reading Mardi, I think, as I did, because they are expecting to find a lost gem of American literature -- a work of genius that was unfairly panned by critics, and that hold sublime insights into the human condition... Unfortunately, Mardi is just a really really awful book and should not even have been published in the first place. Every aspect of the book is a failure:No plot -- the main story, a hunt for the heroine, is forgotten and left hanging about 20 pages after it starts, then brought up again about 20 pages before the end of the book to tack on an ending.Bad writing -- Melville has a pretty dense writing style, generally speaking, but in Mardi his writing is overblown. There are hundred (thousands?) of allusions to literature and history (extremely obscure references), which might be interesting if they were being used to make a point about... something/anything. But the only reason I could find for all of this was either showing off by Melville, or an attempt to hide the fact that there really is no reason for the book as a whole. So the book is all fluff, but it is dense overblown undecodeable fluff.No characters -- The bulk of the book is a retelling of several conversations that take place on a boat as they search for the main character's love interest. Melville seems to think he is setting the stage for high philosophical debate, so he didn't see the need to give the speakers personalities, and just had them debate endlessly and pointlessly, and irrelevantly...Mardi was extremely frustrating to read, and instead of feeling like Melville was unfairly criticized for taking chances, I came out of the experience on the side of the 19th century critics and readers that rejected the works that followed. And this was after enjoyable reads of both Typee and Omoo... Mardi really detracts from the enjoyment of even Moby Dick -- after Mardi it is difficult to take anything the guy wrote seriously.There is nothing here: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"In Megatrends Asia, Naisbitt does an excellent job in presenting the next eight major shifts taking place in Asia. His use of precise examples and interviews clarifies the points he is trying to express. For example, he sites specific countries and their new infrastructure projects. He presents specific statistics, like with Asian credit and the number of credit cards being issued. Acer Group is mentioned as an example of the rise in Asian brand names.However, I do not believe Naisbitt give adequate defense to the negative issues surrounding these shifts and their impact on the region. He briefly mentions pollution, environment, human rights, but he does not put much emphasis on them. Overall, I think Naisbitt presented a positive and fairly accurate prediction of the future. But he (we) should not ignore the inevitable negatives surrounding these shift in Asia.END"},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"Naisbitt has done it again, this time turning his attention to Asia. His earlier book, Megatrends, attempts to set the agenda for international business in the next century. Now he aspires to do the same thing for Asia-watchers, or claim to be so. Not a critical enough piece of work though, and Naisbitt, despite his many interesting observations of the 'megatrends' influencing Asia in the so-called pacific Century, still fails to convince why Asia will lead the world economy and why it's so important to understand this continent."},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"This is a book that endeavours to predict the future and like all works of the genre it must stand or fall by the quality of its predictions. Naisbitt is recognized as one of the world's top political and economic forecasters, with a number of best selling 'futurology' books to his name. The problem with this particular book is not that the predictions are inaccurate, but rather that most of them are either common sense or are already taking place.The book is divided into eight chapters, each describing one of the, &quot;Asian megatrends that are reshaping the world.&quot; The last of these megatrends is simply &quot;From West to East.&quot; Naisbitt says that, &quot;Asia was once the centre of the world, and now the centre is returning to Asia.&quot; He even goes as far as to predict that, &quot;we are moving towards the Asianization of the world.&quot;Naisbitt makes use of an array of facts and figures to support each of the eight trends. Mostly this is done successfully, but occasionally the facts seem open to other, more intuitive interpretations, and the conclusions he draws sometimes appear strained. For example, he says, &quot;demands in the Indian art market are so great that artists sell their works as fast as they are finished.&quot; The impression he is trying to create of a booming art market is clear, but do all Indian artists really sell all their work as soon as it is finished? Are their no unsold pieces to be found anywhere in the country? What are the prices of these highly desirable and much sought after works of art? Sometimes the way the arguments are presented raises more questions than it answers. Despite this the reader is left in little doubt that the overall evidence supporting each 'megatrend' is compelling, and the evidence has continued to mount since the publication of the book.In his The Cynic's Word Book, Ambrose Bierce defines the future as, &quot;that period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true, and our happiness is assured.&quot; If Naisbitt's vision of the future is correct then Asia's affairs will prosperous, its friends will be true, and its happiness will indeed be assured."},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"This book is frighteningly like the accolades written in the thirties in support of Fascism. Newspeak prevails. The \\"eight pillars\\" are no more than a series of propaganda slogans endorsed by the People's Ministry of Truth.As one example, the Naisbitts hold up something called \\"vertical democracy\\" as a new, improved, Asian alternative to the \\"Western\\" model. Vertical democracy, however, is never defined. instead it appears to be a management slogan that would be more familiar to an MBA than a corporate lawyer.Even propaganda might be worth reading if the chapters each broke new ground. After the first few pages, however, the Naisbitts' theme becomes predictable. A western principle, e.g. free speech is raised as an arrogant shibboleth only to be toppled in the face of glorious examples of State Corporatism. For example, in the \\"pillar\\" devoted toward liberating the artists and intellectuals, a few anecdotes are given about how individuals have become wealthy selling their work in a global market while explaining that conformity to the State line is good for business. Suppression of a free press is written off as necessary to good order.Chinese excesses such as cultural hegemony within its own borders, support for abusive governments in Korea, Burma, Africa or the mideast, are celebrated as examples of how stupid the west is not to understand the beneficient intent of the Chinese system. Classism, a rising issue in China, is not mentioned.The claim to predict the future would be all too familiar t corporate flacks working for Microsoft, Sony, Phillips, Putin, or il Duce."},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"I read this book as my interest in Asia was beginning. Naisbitt's methodology of tracking trends is perhaps not entirely scientific, but it is more precise than much of what passes as future watching. Certainly we left the American century and are now entering the Asian one.Naisbitt falls down in his timing. He is entirely bullish about regional opportunities. But what happened in 1997? The regional financial contagion brought down much of the good times in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand and elsewhere. The Malaysian Multimedia SuperCorridor slowed. Other development regionally took a backseat as many western companies pulled out.Fast forward to 2004 (perhaps a more appropriate timeframe for Mega trends) and the wisdom is becoming evident again. Shanghai and Bangalore are the world's boomtowns, and many other regional economies are taking off. Perhaps he wasn't so wrong after all..."},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"One of the consistent themes in recent Western literature is a habit of comparing East Asian culture and society with those in the West, and specifically, to pick out those features of East Asian society that were unique and intrinsice to East Asia. Known as Orientalism, this genre had a condenscending undercurrent and brought forth images of coolies pulling rickshaws, corrupt officials smoking in opium dens, and Western sailors catching \\"yellow fever\\" in places like Bangkok and Singapore.From the 1970s' onward, Orientalism has been replaced by growing praise of the economies of the East Asian countries, especially those with large Chinese populations such as Taiwan, Malaysia and China itself. Boasting the virtues of good education, disciplined populations, and strong family ties, Westerners have authored thousands of books on the growing power of the Orient. This book, Megatrends Asia, is just one in a long line of such works. The author uses empirical and statistical data to draw out 8 trends that are transforming the region into a world economic powerhouse. These trends are presented as primarily a shift from a rural, state-directed economy to a networked, consumer-driven, city-based economy. All this is true, but the author fails to fully explore several trends that though are not as positive and beneficial, are still as important in dictating the future of this region. Specifically, these trends are1. The growing dependence on imported energy. Notice China's overtures to various West Asian countries due to oil and natural gas needs.2. The spread of AIDS, heart disease, obesity, and other \\"lifestyle\\" illnesses.3. The growth of military spending AND foreign military involvement in the various East Asian countries.4. The growth in the black market of this region. Forget about the Hondas made in Japan or the seafood farmed in Thailand. What is really making dollars is all the illegal activity such as intellectual property infringement, the sex trade, the production and marketing of dirt cheap consumer goods sporting brand names from Europe's fashion centers...5. The mass, and often forced, migration of whole communities to make way for factories, highways, and other features of an industrial economy.6. The rise of militant Islam. Especially noticeable in Indonesia and Malaysia, but also present in Singapore, Phillipines and Thailand, this foreboding trend is making the orient the next battle ground in Bush's War on Terror.Overall, this book is good, but not great. It correctly recognizes and explores major, region-wide changes, but ignores or minimizes several other major changes."},{"Title":"MEGATRENDS ASIA","review":"Naisbitt explores eight trends that made Asia an economic dynamo during the 80s & 90s. Written prior to the major crash in 1997, the book covers the positives of the go-Goh years. While it's easy to criticise in hindsight, the book fails to recognise some of the major failures of economies which are built so quickly. Like the buildings of many of the Asian cities the book discusses, they were built too quickly and are now crumbling.Naisbitt does however highlight some interesting points. If one were to look at periods of economic growth (cf. China now) they are characterised by similar factors: integrated globalisation rather than nationalism; broadened options / greater choice; consumer-driven growth rather than low cost labour bases; market driven vs centrally planned; rural agro-economies to urbanisation; labour intensive to hi-tech; greater participation of women in the workplace. The 8th, however - \\"from west to east\\" - is far from an objective, intelligent look at Asian success. Sycophancy goes a long way in Asia - but objectivity is the basis of sound business books. There are many things in Asian culture which actively mitigate against Asia's ascendancy to its economic potential - it would have been more beneficial (not to mention professional) for the author to compare the Asian vs western approaches vis-&agrave;-vis long-term economic growth and prosperity.The book is easy-to-read and has good Notes and Index sections.

He is a public voice for the struggle of Palestinian determination which has seemed unviable for so many years. If you know nothing of the Israeli/Palestinian struggle, read this book. Prof. Said was one of the many Palestinians expelled from the area in 1947. He was educated in the U.S. and speaks from an ex-patriate point of view. His involvement in the politics for Palestinian rights is incredible, unmatched, and deserves admiration. His book reveals a side never told in the American media. He has a clear sense of what problems do exist, and provides numerouse examples, parallel scholarly sources (i.e.Chomsky), and facts. Prof. Said has also written several other books about this and other subjects pertaining to Orientalism, Musicology, and Literary Criticism some of which include: &quot;Culture of Imerialism&quot;,&quot;Orientalism&quot;,&quot;Covering Islam&quot;, and &quot;After the Last Sky&quot;."},{"Title":"The Politics of Dispossession: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994","review":"It is remarkable how relevant these essays seem still, even as they lead up to the era of the Oslo process, in the frozen present since 1967, or 1948. Sorting out the myths of the Arab-Israeli conflict can be a full-time job, and that's the problem. Said's witnessing of the issues since 1967 has always been one component of the unfolding tragedy. The Arab-Israeli conflict sometimes seems in a time warp, and the relevance of these essays endures, whatever one's perspective. Said's acerbic commentary seems to hover over the decades, and his personal account, to start the book, is a permanent record of those who endured the juggernaut."},{"Title":"The Politics of Dispossession: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994","review":"Edward Said's writings pertaining to Palestinian and Near Eastern affairs are always well-written, deeply insightful, and immensely compelling. This collection of writings, primarily dealing with the emergence of a Palestinian self-consciousness, was authored of the course of nearly thirty years. Not only does it provide a uniquely valuable historical catalogue of Said's thoughts upon Palestinian issues, it traces well the Palestinian self-view. Edward Said is, to my mind, one of the most truly complete thinkers alive today...his thoughts, be they upon literary criticism, culturalism, politics, or ethnography, scintillate...this collection is no different. For those wanting a, albeit ocassionally caustic, tracing of the Palestinian self-view and world-view of them, this stands as a superior resource."},{"Title":"The Politics of Dispossession: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994","review":"If there is any cause in this whole wide world where the obvious, glaring injustice of it all has been summarily ignored and dismissed by most of the world's leading intellectuals, it is the cause of the Palestinian freedom movement.Said's (pronounced Sayid)--a Palestinian Arab of Christian descent--was that rare voice which informed the world of the Zionist duplicity, in a way that laid bare the untold sufferings of over 4 million of its inhabitants in the most lucid manner possible. For over three decades, Said's was a lone cry in the New Yorkian wilderness, which drew attention to the State of Israel's Ocean liner of lies ever since (and even before) it came into existence.Said's pain and melancholy comes through, etched in every page of this book and makes for frightful reading. Given the supposed openness of the media in democratic nation-states, it's shocking how through over 5 decades, the combined might of Zionism's religious fanaticism, the traditional incompetence of ruling monarchies in the Arab world, the West's moral ambivalence to call the Israeli spade a bloody shovel and the Zionist lobby in Washington have been able to keep an entire nation of millions in a sort of permanent exile.This book neatly divided in 3 parts critiques everything that is wrong and tragic about the Palestinian movement with merciless felicity and attention to detail that a proper understanding of this cause deserves. Of course, he is severe (and justifiably so) on Israel, but it is his attacks on the rest of the Arab world and the dishonest intellectuals of the western world that makes for fascinating reading. Truly, an intellectual like Said, rarely ever loses his relevance or goes out of fashion. This book is a priceless gem, to be read and re-read by anyone who wants to move beyond standard middle-east explanations, terrorism clich&eacute;s and the rhetoric of \\"with us or against us\\"."},{"Title":"The Politics of Dispossession: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994","review":"If all could read this book, it might help meople to understand what is happening to the people of Palestine."},{"Title":"The Politics of Dispossession: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994","review":"Thank God for Said.

The Israel Lobby continues to wag the American dog. America's blind support of Israel and the billions of US taxpayer dollars continue to prop up the Israeli apartheid regime and make peace impossible.It was hard for me to read these essays without getting angry: at the self-serving lies of Israeli apologists, at the cynicism of every US administration, at the sheer stupidity and venality of Palestinian leadership (so-called!).Israel will never make peace with the Palestinians through negotiations as long as the US continues to subsidize Israel. Where is the incentive?I fault Said for timidity in not elaborating on HOW Palestinians should prosecute their struggle. It is long past time that Palestinians accept that depending on their \\"Arab brothers\\" is going to get them nothing and nowhere. None of the essays helped me to understand how Said proposes to get Israel to allow Palestinian self-determination and statehood.I also fault Said for his failure to mobilize any organized opposition the Israel Lobby in the US. Said may be much-celebrated in a certain small left-leaning ghetto of the intelligentsia, but he is a marginal figure in national politics and the debate (very little allowed) on Israel. The Lobby is powerful, yes. But the Israel Lobby does nothing illegal: it peddles influence and money and thereby influences politics in its favor, and nothing prevents a Palestinian Lobby from adopting similar tactics and emulating the Israel Lobby. The surest, perhaps the only, way to Palestinian self-determination is to change US policy towards Israel."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Surely this is &quot;The Biography&quot; in the same sense that to the Scholastic thinkers, Aristotle was &quot;The Philosopher.&quot;More to the point, it is an endlessly fascinating book, one of those rare works that can be opened at random with consistently rewarding results. Johnson, of course, is one of those rare characters who demonstrates that life is not necessarily less rich than fiction, and Boswell is an entertaining (and amusingly exasperating) chronicler. The &quot;Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; is also well worth reading and randomly revisiting.However, I'm somewhat alarmed by the comments below about the accuracy of this version. I bought this because it was a decent-looking hardback version--I had actually read a library copy (some long out-of-print edition). Could some reviewer please explain the deviations? My skimming and minor re-reading hasn't revealed anything glaring yet, but it's been a while since my original reading, and I haven't sat down for a long Boswell read in a few years."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I have read alot of biographys until a recently a Cambridge graduate friend recommended the first great biography-Life of Johnson. My British friends have a much better view of literature at large than I do so I listening and purchased this piece. I only appreciated Samuel Johnson for his work with the first English Dictionary which a first edition now retails for over $35000. James Boswell his biographer deplicts his life with such vivid respect and admiration so as to make me better understand what a true friend can be. They obviously had a great relationship for more than 40 years. Samuel Johnson is captured with all his great and abundant humor and deep insight. I love this quote\\" One man may lead a horse to water but twenty may not make him drink\\". All in all it is 1400 pages worth reading because its insight into 18th century life in London is so heart felt. Additionally alot of the their conversations took place at a Pub called the Mitre. It is located on Mitcham high street in Tooting, UK. I lived near by and spent a few nights their with friends. Little did I realize I was in the very pub where so many infamous conversations took place some two hundred years ago. A great read."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"For those interested in a reliable text, I suggest the &quot;World's Classics&quot; paperback edition. The hardcover edition, while attractive, is somewhat suspect."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson is often called the greatest biography of all-time and may well be. Perhaps such a work can get no higher praise, but it is also highly notable as the first true modern biography - the first really resembling what we think of as biography today. Boswell set new standards for thoroughness, accuracy, and research, greatly expanding the very concept of what a biography could be. He was also very far ahead of his time in anticipating what was later called gonzo journalism - writers inserting themselves into real-life stories; it is of course not done in the same way as later writers, but the concept is similar. Most remarkable of all, though, is that the book is immensely readable, entertaining, and edifying over two hundred years later, which can be said of very few biographies. It is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in Johnson, Boswell, or the late eighteenth century European intellectual circle.Johnson was perhaps England's best known writer during his last several decades and one of the most famous in the world besides being widely known and renowned for lexicographical and other accomplishments. However, this book's greatness and fame are such that he has long been known primarily via it. Many read it who have read very little or none of him, showing that, unlike nearly all biographies, it has earned a life of its own. There are many reasons for this, not least the fine writing. Even more fundamental is that the book vividly brings an exciting, integral, and profoundly influential era to life. It covers the late Enlightenment when many of the most important people to ever live were prominent. In addition to Johnson, we get first-hand glimpses of such illustrious personages as Adam Smith, Oliver Goldsmith, Pasquale Paoli, David Garrick, and many, many others. Numerous other heavyweights - Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, King George III, etc. - are only slightly in the background. We also get contemporaneous accounts of major events like the American Revolution and the lead up to the French Revolution. In short, though ostensibly the biography of one person, the book is as vibrant, lifelike, and memorable an account of a supremely important era as any history book.Yet Johnson is always the focus, shown literally from birth to death. Anyone interested in him will find a wealth of information about all aspects of his life as well as his thoughts, feelings, influences, intellectual background, and far more. There is also a great deal of information about his work. Unlike nearly all biographers, Boswell actually knew Johnson well; he was his friend for many years and spent several months annually in his company, essentially interviewing him and making voluminous notes of his conversation. This last is indeed the book's heart and by far its most famous element. Johnson was perhaps his era's most famous conversationalist, revered for wit and argument; Boswell heard many hours of his conversation and reports faithfully. His style here was again innovative. Rather than sprinkling isolated quotes anecdotally, he went to great pains to reproduce full conversations, not only describing the setting and others present but even using drama-like name headings for full verisimilitude. We thus not only see what Johnson said but where, how, and usually why he said it. Many world famous Johnson sayings that would otherwise be lost - i.e., \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\\" - are immortalized here, as well as some quotes by others. This alone would make the book of great value.Much has been made of how Boswell's presence affected this; knowing he would write the biography, or at least thinking it possible, he undoubtedly orchestrated much, drawing Johnson out when he might have otherwise been silent. Much of this would have been done in any case as he clearly admired Johnson and loved his talk, but there is no denying the question's importance. Some have condemned Boswell as a shameless celebrity whore or otherwise questioned his motives and veracity, but nearly everyone will consider this nitpicking, fascinating as the question is. For nearly everyone, it makes the book better - far more personal and engaging than biographies are usually even capable of being. Also, for what it is worth, such things mean the book in many ways tells us nearly as much about Boswell as Johnson, making it a sort of hybrid biography/autobiography.Boswell understandably focuses on the years he knew Johnson, meaning the book is greatly lopsided in favor of the later years after Johnson became famous and nearly all his major work was done. This will annoy those who want a more balanced overview, especially as Boswell makes short shrift of some important early events. Those wanting a more conventional balance should get one of several later biographies, especially as Boswell makes a few errors and, at least according to later sources, leaves out some highly interesting - if not necessarily essential - facts. He openly admits doing so at the start in order to protect Johnson's reputation, though much of what he says elsewhere is unflattering, but some of it may have been unknown to him. For most, though, this is the only Johnson biography that will ever be needed - and its greatness, influence, and importance are such that it is required for all readers with even the slightest interest in English and European literature and history and the art of biography even if they care little or nothing for Johnson or Boswell.As for this edition, it has a wealth of supplemental material, making it ideal for serious readers. An excellent, lengthy introduction gives substantial background on Johnson, Boswell, and the book plus some critical insight. There is also a worthwhile bibliography, a chronology, and a supremely useful index. As with other Everyman hardbacks, the book itself is also very high quality - clothbound with very strong binding and even a built-in bookmark. This is one of the best versions available."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I enjoyed reading this biography very much, finding Boswell an amazingly adroit reporter and his subject fascinating and wise. Johnson was full of shrewdness and good sense, along with amusing biases and unusual mannerisms, just the sort of person to ask to liven up a dinner. The book is both humorous and moving, written in a lively style, and good for repeated readings through the years."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I had heard since many years about Johnson, i had visited the museum in London, but only now I found the courage the read 'The Life of.....'. It was worth it.Boswell, to my knowledge, seems to be the first biographer in the modern sense of the word. He tries to give a rounded picture of his subject and also a structured account, structured by time but also structured by focusing on the body, the mind and the sould, usually in that order. What a time to have lived in London, to meet Johnson, Adam Smith, Burke, Gibbon. Johnson emerges as the central sun around which all other planets circle. This also makes for one of the weaknesses of this autobiography, that Johnson crowds out all around him. Yes, a biography should put the subject in the center, but not exclusively so. Boswell also neglects to explain the historical context. Like so many writers on contemporary history he assumes his subjects to be of such universal importance as to make them also common knowldge 300 years after publication. Clearly it is not so, and Boswell could have been helpful by putting more of what he is writing into context rather than leaving it to the footnotes of future editors.Delightful rather than annoying are his fights especially with Ms. Thrale about who might be the superior biographer. In 18th century style he does not shy away in calling the competing biographer names and casting doubt on her motives and moral rectitude.All in all a fascinating document, though for modern readers often tedious and only recommended for 'hardcore' readers."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"James Boswell met Johnson when he (Boswell) was 23 and Johnson was 63. As a result, the emphasis of Boswell's biography is on Johnson's later years, but oh, what a record Boswell has left us. Boswell provoked Johnson to comment on a wide variety of topics, and recorded Johnson's doings with his circle of friends and colleagues. Boswell was a pleasant companion for Johnson, who usually accepted Boswell's constant probes (and even accompanied Boswell on a tour of the Highlands in 1773). Through it all, Boswell took notes, and jotted down everything Johnson said, recording many of Johnson's most famous comments. As a result, Boswell's biography of this great man of letters was a landmark biography, different from all biographies which came before, and still a point of comparison for biographies today. If you can get past Boswell's rather (in my opinion) obsequious tone, you will enjoy the ride very much. This Oxford World's Classics edition, edited by JD Fleeman, has a wonderful set of notes not found in other editions. It is a very affordable and thorough edition."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

People who choose to read the Life will not be disappointed.On yet another hand, I can easily understand why the library copy I borrowed, though purchased in 1949, had not yet been read (the uncut pages showing me so): except to specialists, I would not recommend this book in lieu of, say, 1000 or so others.I guess this actually is a useless review: if you have already decided to read this, you shan't have gone wrong; if you're looking for a good read, you're probably not looking here."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Haven't read it yet. But the processing job on the book itself was faulty...several pages were bent over and thus not trimmed properly."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Boswell was not the obvious choice to write the best biography about Samuel Johnson, much less one of the greatest biographies in world literature. He had much less contact with Johnson than Mrs. Thrale, for many years a close friend of Johnson who spent much more time with him than did Boswell. In fact, Boswell spent perhaps 400 days with Johnson over a period of many years. He also was not Johnson's literary executor. Finally, Boswell was regarded by many of his day, and afterwards, as something of an 18th Century celebrity hound. He made a point of meeting every famous person he could (Voltaire, Rousseau), and went to great efforts to make himself famous. Nevertheless, in his Life of Johnson, Boswell succeeded in portraying Johnson and his circle so vividly that more than 200 years later they come across as real human beings. He did this by breaking the convention of concentrating only on the most favorable aspects of his subject's life, and instead describing Johnson's eccentricities of dress, behavior, etc. Moreover, Boswell did not neglect to include incidents that make himself appear ridiculous. The book is both extremely funny and moving. If you read this, you will want to immediatley get a copy of Boswell's book on the trip that Johnson and he took to the Hebrides."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Ah, Ol' Sam, the Great Cham as somebody called him (it's an 18th century misreading of &quot;Khan&quot;, fact fans). My opinion of Johnson the writer fluctuates over the years; sometimes he seems a long-winded authoritarian, at other times his juggernaut sentences seem possessed of a superhuman vitality. Whatever. This isn't Johnson the writer we're concerned with, so much as Johnson the talker - the gruff, ridiculously prejudiced, gloomy, scrofulous clubman, holding forth from the biggest chair in the room, wisecracking, bullying, brooding and sulking.Johnson was as lucky to have Boswell, as Boswell was to have Johnson. The conversations of great men tend not to be much fun; Eckermann's &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; is fascinating, all right, but Goethe's mixture of gossipy cattiness and Olympian pomposity gets to you after a while (Donald Barthelme wrote an evil parody of it). With Boswell's Johnson it's different. He seems at once painfully real and a caricature of himself. Boswell captures both the readiness to pontificate about anything under the sun and the panicky vulnerability. Eckermann's Goethe leaves the room when he's upset (nothing must ruffle the patrician facade) but Boswell's Johnson stays in his chair - we can see his reaction.Of course there are drawbacks, in that half of the book covers the last ten or so years of Johnson's life, but there really isn't that much hard evidence about Johnson's early life beyond what Boswell himself collected. I reserve my doubts about Johnson's cultural politics, but the rolling, rumbling figure that Boswell sets down is one of my favourite characters in literature. Swift has a darker and more perplexing fascination for me, but you wouldn't have got the 44-year-old Swift out of bed at 3AM for a ramble. He'd have hurled his bedpan at you.Why is it a great airport book? Because there's a lot of it, it's unfailingly entertaining and informative, and it's guaranteed not to include a description of an air crash."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

It is a great book (also great is W. Jackson Bate's SAMUEL JOHNSON [1st published 1975]which is a MUST for anyone interested in Johnson). But although I love the Everyman's Library, I do not recommend this edition of Boswell. Unlike the usual quality of the Everyman's Library, its Boswell is rife with typographical errors (there's even missing text!). Though it's the only edition of Boswell I've read, I regret that a correct edition is not on my bookshelf.

The book had a nice heft to it, and the print was large enough for a comfortable read. My only major beef with this edition is that Boswell's text is replete with quotations from a variety of languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian and others, and very few of them are translated into English. Whether the editor assumed that the average modern reader is a polyglot, or was unable to provide the translations for some other reason, I feel deprived at not having had access to this portion of the book's material, particularly as the quotes are most often used to gild the lily of one of Johnson's witticisms. Nevertheless, the book rewards the diligent reader with a wealth of intellectual stimulation, and offers a fascinating look into the England of the period including: polite London society, Oxford University, and jaunts around the British and Scottish countryside. Johnson's somewhat eccentric life and personal habits are lovingly and affectionately relayed by his close friend Boswell, who somehow managed to preserve a vast amount of Johnson's conversation without the aid of a tape recorder. With everyday life as a backdrop, we see how Johnson, a self-described lazy man, managed to produce such an abundant literary legacy, not the least of which was his groundbreaking dictionary. I recommend this book highly to people with an interest in 18th century England, the literary society of the period, or who simply love a great biography."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

D","review":"I'm no expert on 18th-century English literature, or on the famous work I'm being so daring as to review. I did, however, read every line of it, and I can say, I liked it.I started reading this work---oft cited as the greatest biography in the English language, and surely the one where the subject was most un-objectively represented by his fawning chronicler---when I was a sixteen-year-old sophomore in an honors seminar. I finished it literally today, some eleven years and perhaps twenty-two starts and stops later.What remains most strongly in memory, above the man about whom this was penned, is the era itself, which was captured in full dimension here by a scribe whose entire being seemed concentrated upon gulping down those scraps of notice sent his way by the movers and shakers, the \\"A-listers,\\" of his century.As a straightforward biography, this work is oddly paced, anything but impartial, and since it concentrates most of its scope on a relatively brief period in Johnson's life and career, curiously uneven. This is not unusual in biographies, of course, which tend to select moments that most closely define the subject's celebrity, but the pacing in the coverage does stick out at me. It also surprised me to find out that Boswell was around the great Johnson about a year's time, and the rest of his work, in all its ever-excusing hero-worshipping, anecdote-dribbling glory, is the result of his being privy to gossip, to making use of the facts known about Johnson, and by his, frankly, inventing whole sections in a kind of \\"non-fiction-fiction.\\"What forgives all that (if forgiveness is needed) is the thing I mentioned above; namely, no other writer from any era does quite so complete a job of making a person centuries in the future feel THERE for the scenes he's describing. To have wrung as much as he did from Johnson, the greatest \\"talker\\" of his time, shows that Boswell had the reporter's gift for conversation as a means of LISTENING. And all that is why this is the 18th century's finest life story, and also why I came to like this book so much in the years between when it was assigned to me, and when I finally finished it as a pleasure read in the year 2006."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Boswell took as his subject, the person called ' the greatest talker the English language has ever known'. He went around with him, goaded him here and there, and allowed him to talk.In return Johnson said countless wise, provocative, interesting, and offensive but above all humorous things. Boswell wrote down these , and also wrote down , or reconstructed conversations of Johnson with his friends. All of this helped make his subject ' alive' to his readers in a way no detailed recording of his every action from minute one of his life to minute zero at the end of his life could. He had the sense and intuition to help bring out what is most interesting in his subject. And so he presents the subject not only in a realistic way but in a sense in a most appealing way. This made Boswell the pioneer in a form of biography , or in one of the techniques of biography which is central to it. Boswell himself with all his much self- regretted dissolution was also an interesting apprentice, a writer too after all who learned from the Master. Johnson is a great and central figure , for many the greatest critic the English language has ever known but he is too an acquaintance and friend of Garrick, Hume others of distinction .Boswell listens to them also .Johnson was something of a curmudgeon a lovable kind of character who in his anger and outbursts amuses us. He was also a moral teacher although apparently he did not give much attention to the stricture regarding the wrongness of needlessly defaming others.Together these two are one of literature's great teams, not equal to the Knight of LeMancha and Sancho but up there on the top.Like all works of genius this work has its fanatical followers and its petty demeanors. It is better in these cases to trust the first .For a work like this enriches our common humanity as all the truly great books do."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"'No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money,' Samuel Johnson.Sorry, it is a hobby.Samuel Johnson the writer of the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, which was a very big deal in his day as the elite felt the English language was in decline due to it being influenced by so many foreign influences and the marvel of Samuel Johnson's efforts and method of writing made him, according to Lord ChesterfieldLord Chesterfield's Letters (Oxford World's Classics), as someone to be deferred to as the \\"Caesar\\" of the English language. Samuel Johnson, along with his friend and former pupil David Garrick, helped place Shakespeare as the permanent king of the English language; further, Johnson was a great and singular essayist and has an eternal place as a minor poet of the English language. His dictionary shot Johnson into the inner circle of elite in English society.Boswell's \\"Life of Samuel Johnson\\" is a fascinating read as Boswell traces Johnson's life story. Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke, a friend of his, and together the center of English political and cultural life with the 'Literary Club' that they had both started were big players in forming the English reaction to the major liberal events going on in their day and could be said to be the fathers of modern conservatism. They were alive to face the genesis of modern liberalism, in the form of Jean Jacque Rousseau along with the American Revolution, theirs was the conservative response. 'What hypocrites are the drivers of negroes to be demanding liberty,' Johnson in reference to the Americans. (It is funny that Samuel Johnson was against slavery while the more liberal Boswell was for it). Although, I know Edmund Burke felt England to be in the reconcilable wrong with the American RevolutionEdmund Burke's Speech on conciliation with the American colonies,: Delivered in the House of commons, March 22, 1775; ed., with notes and a study plan ... I. Crane (Twentieth century text-books)the Doctor, Samuel Johnson, did not and felt the Revolutionaries hypocritical ingrates. What is good about conservatism lays with these two fellows, Burke and Johnson. It is also amusing that Johnson's conservativism included the observation that countries should be judged by the condition in which their poor lived, disapprobation given to the worse.Samuel Johnson came from very humble roots and his early life was spent in modest means, fortunately he was surrounded by books. His first years in London were quite a struggle, near pennyless, sometimes sleeping on the streets. The money he ended up getting for writing the dictionary wasn't much in the end, it was the fame that got him some wealth.A marvelous read. Giving advice about the legal profession, education: his advice - just do it; habits form early and habits are hard to break... lots of interesting views from how to conduct oneself socially (Boswell seemed in constant search of this) to political commentary (one of my favorite was his advice on being weary of those that wrap themselves in the flag)... too much to write about. Boswell, when he first meets Johnson is so filled with awe and reverance but it mellows out some, he even starts playing games with the Doctor; however, he always greatly respects him but the idolitry disipates.Although Samuel Johnson's conservativeness and strong opinions might turn people off I find it refreshing compared to the stealth tactics of politics today. Politicians don't say what they mean and that is also probably why the Doctor was discouraged from entering politics in his day by some close friends with ties in that area, somethings change only by degree. James Boswell, the author, didn't agree with the Doctor all the time but appreciated the hard, realistic way of looking at things and amusingly delivered (mostly by quirky analogies) that Samuel Johnson did.Then Boswell is a story in himself. Boswell's Rousseau-ist fever for the notions of the 'Noble Savage, Natural Man'The Noble Savage: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1754-1762was interesting also; his generation caught it and he had strong sentiments towards it despite Johnson's arguments against its reasoning. This fever also, at the least, lent cover to the American Revolution.Johnson could only afford one year of college. Received an honarary Doctorate for his dictionary.One of the books one should read before they turn 20.The best synopsis of Rousseau and in his own words is probably 'Creed of a Priest of Savoy'The Essential Rousseau (Essentials)"},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I own the Penguins Classics edition but no matter. The story is wonderfully rich. Boswell really is a master story teller because at no point did the story become dry. I literally read and savored every single word.All I knew of Johnson is that he wrote the first English Dictionary. But I had no idea this man was full of wit. He had a temper no doubt and definitely went through periods of what sound like moderate to severe depression followed by periods of bursting with energy, joy and wit and incredibly prolific and productive in those bursts, enough so that he surprised most people with his abilities in those bursts of creative genius. I am biased as I am a psychiatric physician but it sound like bipolar disorder to me.Whatever the case may be, I drank this book up. I'm still reading it, have about 40 pages left and haven't put it down since I picked it up.A must read just because of the sheer wonderful story contained within!"},{"Title":"I Rode With Stonewall","review":"This book, first published in 1940 - long after Douglas' death - is based on Douglas' war-time journal and personal papers. Douglas began to assemble them into book form several times, but never had them published; his relatives did......What emerges are wonderful portraits of Douglas, Jackson (for whom Douglas was a staff officer) and many other well-known (and not so well-known) soldiers and civilians caught in the Civil War. Douglas is decidedly pro-Jackson, but Douglas also shows us the real Jackson: a man who could be cruel to the extreme and then gentle and kind a few moments later. The book is fill with humorous anecdotes, which make it a &quot;fun read&quot; - I could not put it down. Yet there is an underlying sadness in the book, as one watches Douglas' many friends being killed off, sees the homes of his family and civilian friends burned or otherwise destroyed. Douglas never explicitly states it, but the reader can feel the anguish that Douglas - and many others - experienced....... One thing Douglas did not do was go into great detail about each battle. He reasoned that later historians, with a better overall view of things, would do a much better job. What he does do is &quot;put you there&quot; - whether in battle, in camp, or on some small adventure. This is one fantastic book! Along with the memoirs of Gen. E.P. Alexander, these memoirs are about the best I have ever read. Simply a great book!"},{"Title":"I Rode With Stonewall","review":"\\"I Rode with Stonewall\\" is one of the finest personal narratives of the Civil War, America's most decisive and costly conflict. The author, Henry Kyd Douglas, began writing this memoir soon after the conclusion of the war, but put it aside for more than thirty years while he practiced law and raised a family. At his death, his book about the war had not been edited and it wasn't until a descendent discovered the transcript and found a publisher that it was finally released in 1940, on the even of another great martial struggle. I purchased my first copy on a visit to the Fredericksburg battlefield more than twenty years ago and after reading most of it on a flight back from Washington D.C. to California, left it on the plane and in the days before the Internet, it was hard to secure another. Fortunately, on another tour of Civil War battlefields and museums, I managed to bring a copy back for my library - it's that memorable a book. Henry Kyd Douglas was a native of Maryland and a dashing young officer who served on Stonewall Jackson's staff in the early stages of the Civil War. And, like many other Confederate officers and enlisted men, he was devoted to the stern, brilliant artilleryman. Douglas later had a field command and despite being wounded no less than six times, he survived four years of brutal war. Unfortunately, other young heroes of the Confederacy, friends of Douglas like John Pegram, Sandy Pendleton and John Pelham did not. Douglas was handsome, dashing, brave and outgoing and because of these qualities, he was popular with officers on both sides in the war and a favorite of the Southern belles. His account is peppered with fond encounters, but always chivalrous, he abbreviates the names of the women he flirted with. Although the book is full of death, of lives lost in the ill-fated cause of the Confederacy and the abominable institution of slavery, it also shows that there was an idealistic and romantic side to the war. Even in the service of a bad cause, the terrible conflict between North and South brought out the deeper qualities of the men that served.

It is basically the diary of a very young man who was thrust into close proximity of many historical events and figures. He had the good fortune to survive the carnage of the war, unlike the majority of his friends and fellow soldiers, and I thank him for orginizing and writing down his thoughts. The anecdotes are priceless, Douglas' viewpoints are insightful and the picture painted of Stonewall Jackson rings true with everything else I've read about him.

Consider that in a 7 season period they won as many games as the 1950's Brooklyn Dodgers. Pearlman documents the hard drinking, women chasing and drug abusing mets. He shows the Mets as the classic anti hero. With the exception of Gary Carter,Mookie Wilson and Ray Knight there isn't a role model amongst the rest.Parents might be horrified in the celebration of this team but that misses the point . These men are clearly do not claim to be role moodels but really they were a throwback to an earlier time before political correctness and sensitivity in men were common. The Mets had better attendance than the Yankees and really ruled New Yoirk baseball and were a reflection of blue collar grimy 1980's New York.This is a story about how people with flaws can still rise to greatness . I believed the Mets were the last great team built in the traditional manner . Consider that Strawberry, Gooden, Backman. Wilson. Darling were developed by the farm system. Carter, Fernandez, hernandez,H. Johnson,Teufel and Knight were received in trades. There were the last team to win over 100 games and not one free agent.Contrast this to the current Red Sox, Braves and the Yankees that are built primarly on free trades. What's wrong with that ? Nothing if you don't mind baseball being a three team sport. Outside of the Northeast and Chicago baseball is dying .Pearlman makes the point that the Mets were one of the greatest team of all time . He doesn't use statistics ,he uses the emotional argument that the Mets were symbolic of an era that we are not likely to see again. The 1927 Yankees and 1961 Yankees and the other great teams of the any era would be more comfortable in a Met clubhouse than in the current stale environment. Met fans will like this book and Yankees fans predictable will dismiss any homage to a team that won a World Series on the typical Red Sox swoon. But no matter this is a look at a Met team that may be the last championship any Met team will win for a long time."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

I was 16 in 1986; the best age you can be when your team has a season like that. It was truly a season of baseball like it oughta be.Jeff Pearlman spins a fairly entertaining account of the events and characters that made up that magical Mets season, but unfortunately I found myself fighting through it 10 or 15 pages at a time. As I battled through, it occurred to me that perhaps Mr. Pearlman was just missing 3 crucial members from his project team.1) Proofreader2) Editor3) Fact CheckerThis could have been a good book if it had ben edited properly. Sadly it was not, and the result is a barely readable book with real live factual errors.If you are a Mets fan and can't get enough of memories of '86, pick it up for an entertaining read.

A Season of Brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball with Straw, Doc, Mookie, Nails, The Kid, and the Rest of the 1986 Mets, the Rowdiest Team Ever to Put on a New York Uniform--and Maybe the Best","review":"\\"The Bad Guys Won...\\" is what it is -- a collection of stories and player profiles set against a single championship season, one of the most impressive and unique seasons a baseball team has ever produced. Unlike other books chronicling one single baseball campaign, like David Halberstam's \\"Summer of '49\\" or \\"October 1964\\", or others like \\"The Last Good Season,\\" there isn't much else the book has to offer. But that's not to say it wasn't entertaining and enjoyable.Jeff Pearlman takes you through the 1986 Mets championship season, focusing almost entirely on the players and their antics, seemingly going through the entire roster and passing along stories that the reader cannot help but laugh at. All the major characters are covered heavily -- Dykstra, Strawberry, Gooden -- but there really shouldnt be anyone from the team upset over a lack of print. Fans of the '86 Mets probably won't learn all that much, since, I'm pretty sure, many of the antics described in the book have become common knowledge by now. But they'll probably love it anyway. As for non-Mets fans like myself, I still got a kick out of it, and I'm sure most others will as well, unless you're in the hunt for a book with solid baseball analysis.The book shines in a couple of areas outside the realm of the players themselves. There's the background of how the team was constructed after the filthy teams of the early-80's, the classic 18-inning Mets-Astros NLCS game, and some in-season tales like \\"Get Metsmerized\\" and such. Also, it's funny to think about what would happen if this team was present in today's uptight sports world. The 86 Mets couldnt exist today, not even 20 years later, because every little detail is so heavily scrutinized today that the media storm these guys would kick up would be off the charts. Just look at the frenzy stirred up two weeks ago by the Randy Moss \\"fake mooning\\" in Green Bay -- can you imagine what would happen if today's New York and national (especially the national) media got a hold of some of the things Pearlman describes in this book?Speaking of Pearlman, one of the drawbacks to the book is the writing. Luckily the stories themselves carry the book, because the storyteller leaves much to be desired. He comes off too much as a fan and less like an author, and you could sense that he's so giddy writing about these guys that he rooted for as a kid, it's almost like he wants to think he was in that 1986 clubhuse with them palling around and being stupid. He tries too hard to inject his own humor when it's not necessary, and a lot of his stuff falls flat. I'm not saying he's a bad writer, but there is probably a reason why a lot of the more renowned books of this type are written by older, more experienced authors. Perhaps Pearlman will reach that level eventually, but his writing in this book is what knocks it down a peg to me. Although at one point, Pearlman does put his fanship to good use in his description of an encounter with former Met Dave Kingman.Overall though it's highly entertaining for all baseball fans, and sports fans for that matter. The 1986 Mets were very unique, and with the way the sports world has become, a team like that probably won't be seen again."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

This book, especially for younger baseball fans, sets the stage when the Mets pretty much were THE team NY baseball fans cared about as the Yankees had not yet developed the championship forumula they'd forge into a powerhouse dynasty by the '90. The 1980s Mets were a fun, reckless, overly competitive, group of brawling misfits who knew HOW to play baseball, and played it their way! A team so far removed from today's more restrained, conservative great Yankee's that it's hard to realize there was ever a team that existed like this unrestrained bunch. But they DID exist...and for one magical season they played a style of &quot;renegade&quot; baseball unlike anyone had seen before in NY. In an era when there was no &quot;wildcard&quot; to extend the post season, these hated '86 Mets should have and could have won many more championships (they did win their division in 1988 and narrowly lost their division to the St. Louis Cardinals by perhaps a game in 1985). But what they did win in 1986, and how they won it, is the stuff of sports legend. And this is one legend that is as wild a tale today as it was almost 20 years ago."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Of course, if the author had followed this simple rule, there would have been no book. And no advance. And please spare me any mumbo-jumbo about the journalistic mandate to expose the truth. The last thing this book feels like, oddly enough, is journalism.I was an adult Mets fan when they rolled through the 80s, so I had a pretty good idea of the personal failings of the major characters. The reason I bought the book was that, after a pretty disheartening Mets season, it might be fun to relive 1986. But when I was done with this book, my first instinct was to take a shower. I'm not suggesting the author took liberties; I'm just asking what was the point of one nasty--borderline vicious--anecdote after another? What was the point, other than making some money, of dragging this already well-documented group of idiots, miscreants and drug addicts through the mud? In looking at Pearlman's other titles, this appears to be his MO.The 86 Mets, to my mind, were a joyous event. Their legendary disfunctions made their triumph all the more joyous. But there is no joy in this book. My advice is only buy this if you're a Phillies fan.And one last thing, now that I'm warming up: It annoys me that the author doesn't understand the difference between the word 'fury' and the word 'furor.' Not once, but twice.Two positives: I learned a lot about Bill Buckner that I didn't know. And Frank Cashen's ruminations about what the team could have been if Strawberry and Gooden hadn't gone off the deep end were both interesting and a little bit heart-wrenching.But in the end, it's hard to imagine a book so full of nastiness being, in the end, so empty."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Here was a team that we remembered that was so diverse that you would be hard pressed not to identify with at least one of the members. The story is about redemption for some and fulfilling destiny for others. It is a great account of the full season and what led up to it when all most people remember is the Bill Buckner play of Game 6 in the World Series. This provides insight as to much more of what that Mets team was. Although they were favorites to go the distance from the onset, it is an underdog story when you see the players that make up the team and the story of the Mets franchise itself. You will find yourself taken back to a not-so-distant time when Times Square wasn't a real nice area and the baseball players loved those 2 classic male vices...booze and women. However, the book is more than a sensational version of events retold. You do get a real sense of what made the team tick and how each member in his own way played a vital part to their collective success.

While hardly comprehensive, the book offers interesting behind the scenes perspectives, albeit with a strong emphasis on the most negative aspects. Even more general baseball fans, with no emotional ties to the year or team, should find much of interest here.

That wild ride with that baseball team was the most profoundly satisfying baseball season I've ever experienced, and I'm sure I'm not alone.Frankly, after years of suffering with the Mets of Grant's Tomb, the Mets and their long-suffering fans were ready to cut loose, to dance and sing and win, win, win. Where others saw obnoxiousness and arrogance, we saw exuberance and cameraderie. We saw teamwork, butt-busting effort, and hard-earned celebrations. The Sox fans often maintain that the 86 Series was lost on an error as if the Mets should NOT have capitalized on their jittery Schiraldi and Stanley, and the tough-but-fragile Bill Buckner (BTW, off Buckner, everybody-- he was a hell of a ball player and a very classy guy, and you guys sure are doing a lot better in the post-season than we are recently!)It was pure, unadulterated joy, the kind of joy only amazing baseball can afford, and for that, I can never think of those guys as bad. The Mets are a good, contending team now, but when I see the DVDs of the '86 Series, I remember really transcendent baseball played by really vivid personalities. I just loved them."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

The insanity and recklessness of these players, most of them who were so young, so talented and had a chemistry that would bring out the best of themselves on the field, but the worst of themselves off the field. Explosive on and off.Sometimes, I forget that in reality, greatly talented athletes, in their 20s, are usually immature young men who have had a lot of privilege and a lot of covering up of their off field activities. Remember when young, the feeling like you could live forever and not caring in the slightest about having to pay a price for ones abuses ?It is a celebration of baseball played to its highest level, but it is also a story of how their abuses, which were past over when young, would catch up to them later.GREAT, GREAT book.Jon"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

As Pearlman describes it, the Mets could be a more interesting ballclub outside the lines, especially when they were snorting them.As bad as they might have been, the Mets have never been the same since. \\"You couldn't find a Yankee fan,\\" pitcher Bobby Ojeda tells Pearlman. \\"As unpleasant as we were and as obnoxious as we were, people took to us.\\"Pearlman focuses much of his attention on the team's four biggest stars. Doc Gooden was the pitcher whose fastball left sluggers agog, yet his short time in the sun was clouding fast. Keith Hernandez was the heady first baseman with a drug bust in his past. Darryl Strawberry \\"was six feet four inches with the grace of a swan and the power of a tornado.\\" Catcher Gary Carter was nicknamed \\"Camera\\" because he never saw one he didn't like, annoying his teammates with his showboating.The book works its way through the stars and the bench players, even the locker-room attendants, with a smooth style and amusing quotes. As a sports history it is shallow, ignoring the regular season for the most part in favor of what the players did after the games were over. But as a collection of loosely-connected anecdotes about a crazy season with a big finish, it is highly entertaining and a very fast read.Pearlman plays up the seaminess - to a point. Despite the title, there are no really bad guys in the book. Carter is widely disliked for such sins as signing autographs with a smile and staying true to his wife. Strawberry is obnoxious, but only when drinking. Lenny Dykstra tells one autograph seeker to go away because she's too fat, but he's so out of control in general he's kind of endearing. Even George Foster, the one free agent on the team who was an overpaid bust, proves to be just a misunderstood gentleman with a weird sense of humor.As a Mets fan, I used to cringe at the antics of this team, the curtain calls and the after-midnight bar busts. Now, 25 missed World Series Championships later, I find the cocky quirkiness of this team endearing. There was nothing timid or calculated in this bunch. They won it all, and they did it their way, without suits, steroids or manners. And Yankees fans still hate them, which tells you they did something great.Pearlman doesn't quite bring that all in focus, but he does enough with his humor and his subjective approach to make you want to go back and watch those old highlight reels."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

In my opinion, which interestingly enough is what a review is, the book is simply average.It basically reads like a long magazine article, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering that the author was on the Sports Illustrated staff. I only mention it because I payed full price for the hardback and would have liked something more than something I could have read in SI for free.My main criticism of the book is that it is completely anecdotal. A string of stories over the course of a season which never captures the whole. Everything is breezed over; a few stories here, a few stories there. Lack of depth is the main evil of this book. He gives you enough information to interest you, then leaves you high and dry when you want more.I don't want to draw this out too long because I have only one real problem with the book, and you probably already know what it is. It is just too short, and not in the good way where it is just so good that you wish there were more. There should have been more. Too many things were quickly glossed over.That said, the book was entertaining and thoroughly interesting. If you are interested in baseball, I would reccommend this read, but please wait for the paperback or borrow it from a library. Paying cover price on this thing is robbery.To sum up, it's a by the numbers account of a championship season. You won't get much depth, but you will read some funny stories about Tim Teufel."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won! A Season of Brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball with Straw, Doc, Mookie, Nails, The Kid, and the Rest of the 1986 Mets, the Rowdiest Team Ever to Put on a New York Uniform--and Maybe the Best","review":"Pearlman tells the tale of the '86 Mets, how they were put together by brilliant GM Frank Cashen, the turmoil and triumphs of the '86 season, and how this team with so much potential for dynasty status managed to win only one championship.Pearlman begins with a bang--the near destruction of the interior of an airplane by the newly crowned NL champion Mets, returning from Houston after the classic 16 inning battle which won them the NL crown.Much of the focus in the early part of the book is on how GM Frank Cashen built the Mets piece by piece, taking them from the no-hopers of the early 80s to the great championship team of '86.The discussion of the regular season (since the Mets won by some 20 games, not that exciting) is livened up as we meet the individual members of the team.We see the behind the scene tumult as well. Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden display early signs of the flaws that would mar their careers. Manager Davey Johnson seems blissfully unaware of the turmoil which will eventually shatter the Mets, making the Mets of the late 80s one of the greatest teams to win only one championship.Time slows as we reach September, with the Mets' mini-collapse that prevents them from clinching the division against the distant second-place Phillies, leading to a Tuesday night riot at Shea as Mets fans storm--and nearly destroy--the field after the Mets beat the Cubs for the division title.Time slows further for the postseason, where the Mets meet their most severe tests, and two opponents--the Astros and Red Sox--each convinced that they can beat the Mets--and each nearly does. We get blow by blow coverage of the great Game 6 in the Astrodome, and the forever famous Game 6 against the Red Sox at Shea which ends with the famous Bill Buckner play. Pearlman questions Bosox Manager McNamara's decision to leave Buckner in the game. (shades of, though probably this book went to press before, the decision to leave Pedro Martinez in the game in Game 7 against the Yankees in 2003).We see the anticlimactic Game 7 (in which, though Pearlman doesn't catch this, the Mets get a lead at home for the first time in the postseason) and the celebrations--for which Doc Gooden does not appear. The seeds of destruction of the team can be seen even as the city celebrates.Well written with passion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

While many books have been written about the 1986 Mets, most of those were from participants and first-hand observers. Jerry Izenberg and Dan Shaughnessy wrote quickly-forgotten journalistic accounts the following year, as did ghost-writers for Gary Carter and Lenny Dykstra. Of course, to say that Dykstra's book was quickly forgotten would be unjust... his book is well-remembered, but not for any of the right reasons.Pearlman's achievement is to insert himself into the story nearly 20 years later and write an extended \\"Sports Illustrated\\"-style look at the seamy underbelly of \\"baseball like it oughtta be\\". He does this through 187 interviews, but no bibliography. Therefore, if you're keeping track of that kind of thing, it's not easy to determine which player quotes derive from fresh interviews, and which are recycled from old sources. However, his recreations of the infamous Cooter's nightclub arrests, and the trashing of the charter plane flying home from Houston after Game 6 of the NLCS, benefit from an I-was-there sardonic third-person reporting style.John Rocker now plays baseball on Long Island, for an independent team -- for Bud Harrelson, in point of fact. The intersection is amusing for readers of \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\", as Harrelson features in the book, and as Pearlman is the guy who in some respects helped Rocker travel the terrifying downward spiral from World Series to Central Islip. As you might expect from the author who allowed Rocker to marinate in his own oratory, \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\" also features more finger-pointing than other books. Shaughnessy's \\"One Strike Away\\" tells us that Wally Backman went bowling when Game 7 of the World Series was rained out; Pearlman is more interested in following Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, and in reopening the Kevin Mitchell vs. the kitten tale, and in pointing out that some oblivious Met did some lines of coke on the way back from Houston.Pearlman is at his best talking about the role players, whom he clearly admires: the two unnecessary Eds, Hearn and Lynch, do well here. On the other hand, George Foster, who was bounced out of baseball before the playoffs began, doesn't merit the author's sympathy; I would have expected Pearlman to defend him, simply because no-one else ever did. The playoff game accounts are authentic. Pearlman has clearly spent a lot of time with the game tapes and ESPN Classic rebroadcasts, as he takes time to describe the flight path of the toilet paper roll spiraling behind Mookie Wilson just before Bob Stanley wild pitched the tying run home.\\"Bad Guys\\" is a short, meaty read, providing a new look at often-told tales about a bunch of players who won it all and then promptly raced into early obscurity. A few days after I finished the book, new allegations about Lenny Dykstra popped up in the media. Clearly Pearlman may have been on to something."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

At that time the Mets were available in Massachusetts on cable and I watched a lot of their games both because the National League is a better brand of ball and Tim McCarver a top notch analyst. The local Red Sox are something that I try and ignore. Thus the final match-up was a no way can the Mets lose thought. Of course without the interesting umpire calls Houston would have beaten the Mets. Mayber that is a subject for a book as there have been numerous out and out bad calls in all sports.The sadness of exceptional squandered talent, i.e. Gooden and Strawberry along with the inside perspective on the players with their warts keeps the book both informative and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

The team was a reflection of the times they lived in - the loud, wild, crazy &quot;its all about me&quot; time period. There's no denying, however, that they were one of the best teams ever. Pearlman places you along side of them and does a fantastic job (you may recall Pearlman was the Sports Illustrated Writer who did the article on John Rocker). The book focuses on the one year (1986)yet gives in-depth background where needed (e.g., Keith Hernandez' history with the Cardinals and his drug charges).Worth every cent.

In Jeff Pearlman's book about the Mets 1986 season the emphasis is on the \\"nasty\\". This account of the Mets second championship season recounts the carousing that highlighted this hated team. That the Mets were, for a brief time, more hated than the Yankees seems like an abberation.Pearlman follows the Jimmy Breslin rule of reporting. He talks to the guys on the scene getting paid the least. Never have I seen more a baseball book related by the equipment and clubhouse personnel. These provide insights that have not been related elsewhere.This journalistic approach serves as both the books strength and it's undoing. Jeff Pearlman is searching for a baseball Rosebud. He wasn't there, but he is trying to cover these events as if he were. The unreliability of this technique is exposed by two things. First, the opening chapter describes the Mets Roman orgy airplane flight after defeating the Astros in the National League playoffs (disclaimer:I hate the term \\"league championship series or \\"LCS\\"-as far as I'm concerned, post season games leading up to the World Series are Playoffs.). Trying and purporting to give an accurate account when none of the individuals could ever be expected to remember many specifics gets the book off on a titillating, but false, note.This would not be so bad if Pearlman could earn our trust by at least getting his facts straight, but every so often he throws in a factoid that makes a close Met follower like myself react with the \\"huh\\" word. Ed Lynch did not pitch the most games for the Mets between 1982-1985 (he did have the most \\"Games Started\\"). Mike Scott is \\"credited with having the National Leagues highest earned run average in 1982, when it was in fact none other than Tom Seaver. Granted, these are small details, but that is the point. If we can't trust Pearlman with what can be verified, has he earned our trust with what can't be verified? This is the second thing that undermines Pearlman's \\"You Are There \\" approach.The book is worthwhile for the coverage of the lesser lights, and the competent recap of the Met's postseason. This book would be better served by someone with Pearlman's ambition who was there."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Pearlman chronicles the team's brash, \\"in your face\\" style of play, defined by curtain calls and brawls, and their off-field tribulations during their historic 1986 Championship season. Pearlman concludes his book with a short overview of their later years in the '80s, of a dynastic team that never was. For baseball fans who rooted for a baseball team during the 1986 season, and, of course, especially for Mets fans from the New York metro area, _The Bad Guys Won!_ won't disappoint. It is a classic summer read, a great companion to pass the time at the beach or poolside.In his prologue, Pearlman claims nostalgically, \\"There will never be another team like the '86 Mets, and it is sad.\\" Pearlman argues that as baseball has become increasingly a business that follows a corporate model, the fun loving, bad old days of baseball--the excesses perhaps of the '80s itself decade--ended with the '86 Mets. I would argue, however, that just the opposite is the case. The '86 Mets epitomize the best and worst qualities of Major League Baseball. This accounts for why they were such an exciting team to watch, why to this day they still prompt Manichean reactions of love or loathing, and why their story remains compelling.On the suggestion that the '86 Mets had the potential for dynastic heights, even as a Met fan, I have to admit to a contrary feeling. Despite an impressive regular season, this was a team that narrowly won the World Series and teetered on the brink of post-season implosion and defeat. In this sense, they seemed to have inherited certain qualities from their \\"Amazin'\\" predescessors during their early Casey Stengel years. In reality, the '86 Mets were a one season team filled with question marks and stars whose best seasons had been already realized. The team was constitutionally unlike, say, the consistent Atlanta Braves with their capacity for reinvention, the protean, deep-pocketed Yankees with their vaunted history, and more recently, the surprising Oakland Athletics who seem to win by the magic of quadratic equations.This is a wonderfully written, fun book about a roller coaster season. It helped me to remember the '86 season and, as so often happens with memories of the nation's pastime, to relive a year in my own life."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Jeff Perlman's \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\" captures all the magic and excitement of that magnificent team and year. I think Jeff may be correct in his thesis that the 1986 Mets represented the end of an era in baseball - that today's players and teams \\"lack the fire and panache of yesteryear.\\"Perlman does a fantastic job retelling the tale of \\"brawling, boozing, bimbo chasing\\" 1986 Mets. Not only does Perlman do a wonderful job detailing the on-field antics of the powerhouse team, but the details of their off the field trials and tribulations are just as exciting to relive. As a kid, I had no idea that Darryl and Gary Carter were such jerks, for different reasons. As an adult, I feel bad for the way Cashen and the rest of the front office used Kevin Mitchell as the scapegoat for off the field problems.How did I come to be a Mets fan? The first ball game I ever attended was a Yankees game in the Bronx when I was probably six or seven. I only remember that the Yankees were losing in the bottom of the ninth, with Reggie at the plate representing the go ahead run. I was hoping and praying for a homerun. Instead, Reggie struck out to end the game and break the heart of a budding Yankees baseball fan.A few years later, 1983, by dad somehow got some free tickets to a Mets game, box seats! We lived \\"upstate\\", so heading the city for a ballgame was always a special treat. I was only nine at the time. Wow, what a game. Not only did the Mets win, but a young rookie named Darryl Strawberry crushed a home run. I was hooked!I began following the team in earnest through the 83-84-85 seasons, as the Mets added names such as Hernandez, Carter, and Gooden to the roster. I remember the August 1986 double header against the Cardinals when the \\"Lets Go Mets Go\\" video was filmed between games. I can remember booing Doug Sisk at another game when Davey brought him during a rout over the then hapless Atlanta Braves. Nails was my personal favorite - I had to sneak a Sony walkman to school during the NLCS when he smacked his game winning homer against Houston. I still have Game 6 of the NLCS and Game 7 of the World Series on a VHS tape tucked away in a foot locker.I was only twelve years old during that wonderful 1986 season. I was still young and innocent enough not to fully understand the all the tragic flaws in Darryl, Doc, and the others. I will not defend the tragic mistakes that Doc, Darryl, and the rest made. At some level, I feel a bit sorry for both Doc and Darryl, who were still fairly young at this age. How many of us readers made similar, though perhaps not as severe, mistakes during our late teens and early twenties? However, most of us learned from those mistakes and put them behind us, whereas Doc and Darryl are still struggling with their demons almost twenty years later.The book is a fast read and a page turner from start to finish. I was able to finish the book on two three-hour plane rides. This is a must read for a Mets fan, and also for any baseball fan. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

After this book I wanna swear at him some more.Dykstra, Hernandez, Knight, I hated them all. Now I'm glad they didn't stick together to kick the Cubs around for another 5 years.Pearlman's personal investment in his subjects seems to detract a little from a complete madhouse story about a bunch of madhouse escapees, but he gets the job done with an obviously sympathetic style.

Baseball players are people - period. They have talent to swing a bat, run, throw a ball, but this does not make them enlighted, beyond temptation or anymore newsworthy than my father, an insurance executive who drank too much, was abusive to his family and as great as he was at work, could have been so much more.This team is a microcosm of the real world and there are companies out there that make the story of the 1986 Mets pale in comparison.Yes, Gooden and Strawberry could have been Hall of Famers, but they were strong at baseball and weak at life. This makes them human, not tragic.We do love to put people at pedestles, simply to knock them off and watch them fall.The 1986 Mets are my favorite team of all time. They had heart and they went into the season with the highest of expectations for them, and won.What more did you really want from them?Spend your money on a book with an ending that you don't already know."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

They barely won the DS and then only won the WS on one of the most famous errors in baseball history. Great teams win on their own and don't need to rely on gifts like Buckners error. I wouldn't see this Mets team beating any of the Rose led teams of the 70's or Yankees teams of the 90's. I'd even put the '95 Braves against them.I read the book for the purported salicious details listed on the cover and inside jacket. That's about all I found. They drank to excess we are told from first person accounts. The drug use which we pretty much know about already is told about in mostly hearsay. I didn't really get the details I thought I was going to get (sick, yes, but, that is what the book was marketed as). I didn't much care for this team then and I came away caring for them even less. I was most suprised by the picture painted of Gary Carter. If he was half as full of himself as the book says, that is one sad person.Reading how these guys behaved themselves and how the Mets management allowed it makes me appreciate even more how John Scheurholtz and Bobby Cox run the Braves. Pearlman should write a counter book to this one on the Braves and how they are the anti-thesis of the '86 Mets.As Dean Wormer said, \\"Drunk, fat, and stupid is no way to go through life.\\" Are you listening Doc & Straw?"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

I suppose 86 still seems fresh and recent to us thanks to the endless video replays we've seen over the years. That's why it was interesting to get this book and see a perspective of looking back on this dominant team with the benefit of nearly 20 years hindsight now upon us.Jeff Pearlman's book almost delivers. The overview of how the team is put together and what they went through is fine. He also hits the nail on what kind of team this 86 club was in terms of attitude.Unfortunately, Pearlman's problem is like so many of those overawed by the 86 Mets, he seemingly keeps looking on this &quot;bad guys&quot; side of the 86 team as some kind of asset to be admired, and in the process overlooks the simple fact that the me-first bad-guy attitude of this team explains why they were nothing more than a one-season wonder, who squandered a chance to become a truly great baseball dynasty. Sure, Frank Cashen made bad trades that made that possible, but just imagine what kind of a better club would have resulted if there'd been a bit of discipline exercised to keep Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry from wrecking their one-way tickets to Cooperstown, and the Mets chance at greatness in the process? Ultimately, that lack of discipline that they could get by with for one year in 86 came back to haunt them in more ways than they could have imagined.That is why this 86 club will never be confused with the real great New York teams of all time like the 27, 61 and yes, the 98 Yankees. Pearlman's contemptuous dismissal of the late 90s Yankee dynasty as a bunch of &quot;boring&quot; players misses one elementary point. The 98 Yankees sustained themselves to win two more championships in a row and the 86 Mets produced zilch (just as the franchise has produced zilch since). The Yankee fans like me, will gladly take that kind of sustained excellence done with less smartass pizazz over being a one-year wonder with too much flash, any time."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

The 4-star rating I've given is probably a greater reflection of my fond memories than my opinion of the skill of the writer. Then again, this book did make for a lightning fast read so no doubt it was written adequately and perhaps even quite well. On the field of play they were amazing to watch and root for. As this book taught me, off the field they were even more entertaining. Apparently they managed to win almost in spite of themselves as their talent overrode team harmony.

Unless you know who Ed Hearn is, you can probably skip this book. But if you thought the 86 Mets were one of the greatest teams of all time, then the book is worth a shot. The story focuses on the off-field antics of the team, to include the drinking, drugs, and women. The inside scoop on what went on in the locker room was the best part of the book. The description of the actual season is average as was the writing, but it did bring back great memories from that amazing year. The last chapter tells where each member of the 86 Mets ended up, which was great for the diehard fans, but meaningless to everyone else. 4 stars if you think that a night a drinking with Mr Met sounds like fun. 3 stars if you are from New York , love baseball and are old enough the remember the 86 Mets. 2 Stars for everyone else."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

However this book simply does not disappoint in pleasing any fan who was around and remembers the amazing 1985-6 team. The Mets have been erratic at best and God-aweful at worst since 1987 or so. It's nice to have such an explicit behind the scenes look at the team that so many of us fondly recall (surely followed by a sigh and a shake of the head no doubt). The team had it's share of self-induced casualties (Gooden, Strawberry) hot-shots (Hernandez, Dykstra) and team losers (my favorite - Heep, Sisk - who sound like they were loads of fun to hang out with).In short if you recall the mid-80's New York Mets with great fondness - than this book is a must-read.

It wasn't just that they were a team full of sluggers and great pitching; when the Mets came to town, it was probable that they would win, beat you up, steal your girlfriend, drink your beer, and trash your home. They were the bullies of baseball.Jeff Perlman's book about the '86 Mets is confirmation of everything everyone thought about them: they were a team loaded with captivating young talent, unrelenting drive, and an arrogant streak; as unstoppable as a runaway train, and almost as self-destructive. From drunken and destructive behavior to the crazy pranks and music videos, the '86 Mets were a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, and Perlman captures all the forces that conspired to make them great. From the General Manager all the way down to the equipment manager, Perlman leaves no stone unturned in his look at the team.By 1986, the young stars of the Mets had begun the behavior that would lead to their downfall; the impending doom of the team's best players while the team was soaring is one of the most interesting facets of this book. Perlman chronicles the rumored drug use of Dwight Gooden, Daryl Strawberry's alcohol abuse, and Lenny Dykstra's entire lifestyle; all of which made the Mets into an invincible caricature of a baseball team, and also conspired to bring about the downfall of a team that should have been a dynasty.I really enjoyed this book; I knew the Mets were a crazy bunch, but I had no idea how odd the group of personalities were, nor how far into the realm of the preposterous their behavior ventured. For anyone who remembers Doc, Straw, Mookie, Nails, the Kid, the Scum Bunch, and the rest of the Mets, this is a very interesting look at the baddest team to ever take the field."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Before anyone ever heard of Osama bin Laden. It was good to be a Mets fan back then. I remember the agonizing extra-innings playoff game against the Houston Astros. New Yorkers of every size, shape and color lined up 10 deep in front of every storefront window in Manhattan, watching that unbelievably suspenseful game, knowing full well the shadow of Met-killer Mike Scott loomed over a dreaded game 7. Even shops that didn't sell TVs put one in the window for the sidewalk crowds that afternoon.The mood was electric, excited, exhilarating. People just would not tear themselves away and go home. Lifelong friendships were struck as the hours went by and the stalemate continued.When the Mets finally pulled it out, after 16 excruciating innings (practically a doubleheader!) you could hear the collective howl of relief erupt across all five boroughs, as emotionally-exhausted strangers hugged each other (Yup, in New York! I saw it with my own eyes.) It would eventually go down as one of the greatest games ever played in the history of baseball. Surely, we thought, after such a historic playoff series, the main event at Fenway would prove anticlimactic. Little did we know...I remember my wonderful Dad, who's gone now, with the Mets at the very brink of elimination and despair - in what would become the legendary game 6 against Boston. And when Bill Buckner did his famous imitation of a croquet wicket, we both spontaneously shot 6 feet into the air. I remember our eyes meeting about a foot below the ceiling, in a moment that's forever frozen in time, with a yell that must have woke the dead. The whole block was on fire, like a dozen New Years Eve celebrations in one. It sure woke up the Mets - because there was no stopping them after that. It all comes rushing back in the pages of this excellent book. I was less interested in what brats the upstart Mets were, which amused New Yorkers and irritated everyone else at the time, and more interested in the fact that, as this book makes clear, it was really the end of an era in baseball.Ya gotta believe.

The '86 Mets were a brawling, obnoxious, sociopathic, and preeminently dynamic group of guys who won big on the basis of sheer ROCKS. They fit their time, the Ivan Boesky Era, hand in glove, a time when excess flowed as readily as vodka and material wealth was as dispensable as the cocaine that was disappearing up Darryl's and Doc's noses. Things were so bad that more than one airline banned the Mets from travel after the team returned to them planes soaked in rum, vomit, urine, feces, and Animal House buffet-style menu offerings. Sexual harassment suits abounded. \\" 'F' 'em!\\" the Mets shouted happily and moved on to their next target.In the midst of the season-long orgy of booze, blow, broads, bar fights that Pearlman recounts with such glee, this team of two-fisted drinkers happened to win just a few (108) ball games. They had 16 innings of trouble in one day with the Houston Astros (whose pitcher was doctoring the ball by everyone's non-admission), and they nearly lost the World Series to the resurgent Boston Red Sox who had them down to their last out when the ball dribbled ever-so-slowly between Bill Buckner's legs . . . dooming the Sox to another eighteen years of egg salad baseball.Sadly, the '86 Mets were broken up right after their Championship. They were deemed \\"unmanageable\\" by the ownership, which deemed the costs of supporting the team's bail, property damage, and tort suit costs just too high, despite the fact that the Mets had reinvigorated New York baseball (and baseball in general) in a way not seen since The Era of The Giants', Yankees' and Brooklyn Dodgers' 1950s annual contests. But, for this fan, it was glorious while it lasted."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won! A Season of Brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball with Straw, Doc, Mookie, Nails, The Kid, and the Rest of the 1986 Mets, the Rowdiest Team Ever to Put on a New York Uniform--and Maybe the Best","review":"According to former Mets first baseman Keith Hernandez, who played on the 1986 New York Mets squad, today's baseball players are \\"robots\\" who dress nicely and lack emotion. Jeff Pearlman, author of \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\", goes even further, claiming athletes in the major leagues these days are mostly dullards who listen to their iPods, play their video games and hole up in their hotel rooms on the road as if the outside world doesn't exist. Though it's probably not as cut and dry as that, it is true that the 1980s and the decades that preceded it were periods when professional athletes were considerably more rough around the edges, less exposed by the media and less influenced by the almighty dollar and the marketing bonanza that follows big-money contracts. To be sure, players like Dwight Gooden and Daryl Strawberry capitalized big-time on the endorsements that came their way, but as Pearlman points out, the \`86 Mets symbolize a more free-for-all time period for athletes that is refreshing to recall and all but extinct nowadays.The \`86 Mets might not have been as crazy as, say, 1980s-era Motley Crue, but they were definitely a wild bunch of in-your-face ruffians. During the season team brawls took place on the field and in bars; planes got trashed; ridiculous team rap songs got recorded; peppy drugs erased yesterday's hangover; womanizing took place on the road; crazy, intricate pranks happened during games; and an all-for-one cocky mentality defined this never-say-die team -- those were the things that made this group of Mets so interesting, memorable and despised by many. Amazingly, manager Davey Johnson, himself no teetotaler and a very bright man with a wide range of interests outside of baseball, let his players do their thing off the field. As long as the Mets were winning, which they did with consistency nearly the entire season, Johnson let the \\"boys will be boys\\" mentality reign supreme. Undoubtedly, Johnson was the right manager at the right time for the right team.Some of the players' shenanigans were serious and had consequences, however. The drug use by Gooden, for example, though slyly hidden from the public and even from team members, was very real and a sobering reminder of how the mighty can slowly descend to addict oblivion hell. Yes, Gooden may have had several more solid years with the Mets after \`86, but his longevity, star power and overall performance faded bad as his substance abuse problems continued. Unfortunately, Gooden's downward spiral seemed to start in earnest during the \`86 season. And Strawberry, Gooden's seemingly on-and-off buddy, was hardly better in the \\"just say no\\" department. In fact, he may have been worse.This was a team of diverse, offbeat characters -- not all of them complete party animals, either -- and Pearlman does a good job of relating what went on during the unforgettable \`86 season. Unfortunately, the author inserts his sarcastic opinions and unfunny comments a bit too much, and his overly enthusiastic descriptions of the mayhem at times sound fawning, envious and a bit adolescent, no different from the grown men he's covering. On the field, though, it's great to read about the Mets' willful trek through the playoffs, where the National League Championship Series with the Houston Astros was almost as fascinating to read about as the classic seven-game World Series against the forever cursed Boston Red Sox (at least at the time). All in all, if you want the dishy scoop on this colorful Mets team, Pearlman's book is a great place to find it."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won! A Season of Brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball with Straw, Doc, Mookie, Nails, The Kid, and the Rest of the 1986 Mets, the Rowdiest Team Ever to Put on a New York Uniform--and Maybe the Best","review":"The 1986 Mets will go down in history as the team that had it all, won it all, and just as quickly lost it all. Jeff Pearlman's book, while containing material that had been previously discussed, hashed and rehashed, really shines when it gets into the dynamics and characters behind the 1986 team. Whether it's talking about the infamous \\"Scum Bunch\\", or Bobby Ojeda's seething hatred toward the Red Sox, or the entire league's hatred of Gary Carter, Pearlman's book opens some doors and shines some light on stories that were not previously discussed (for obvious reasons).The book is basically a chronological history of the Mets' rise to prominence in the early to mid-80's, beginning with Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday's purchase of the club, to the hiring of Frank Cashen as the club's General Manager, to the jettisoning of of malcontents and has-beens and acquisitions of Keith Hernandez and Gary Carter, all the way through the 1986 season and the dismantling of the championship team. And while it could have been another treatise on \\"how NOT to run a ballclub\\", Pearlman for the most part avoids that and delves into the interpersonal relationships between the players and the dominating baseball team that it created.It is THIS aspect of the book that drives the narrative, and turns it from merely a decent book to a good one. Everyone knows who the players on that 1986 team were. But not everyone knows who they WERE. And that is, a collection of ragtag men who gelled at the right time and at the right place. Which is not to say that it was perfect. For every nice guy on the team, like an Ed Hearn or Tim Teufel, you had a guy like Darryl Strawberry, who is described by one teammate as the nicest guy on the ballfield, but when liquored up, perhaps the most miserable SOB on the planet. In one anecdote, Pearlman describes a scene between Strawberry and pitcher Bruce Berenyi that is sure to make some cringe at the ruthlessness and disrespect with which Strawbery treats a teammate and fellow human being. You had guys like Kevin Mitchell, who came from a rough gang-infested neighborhood, and who had no problem bringing that rough attitude on the field and nearly killing a player during one of the team's (many) bench-clearing brawls. You had guys like Bob Ojeda, whose brashness and outspokenness put him on bad terms with ownership and his fellow teammates in Boston in 1985, who gets traded to the Mets in the offseason and literally foams at the mouth at the prospect of facing the Red Sox in the World Series. And who could ever forget Gary Carter? To the casual observer \\"The Kid\\" was the driving force behind the 1986 Mets, but to his teammates he was as phony as a $3 bill, a shameless self-promoter who didn't see a camera he didn't like and a guy who was the main reason behind at least one of the bench-clearing brawls.These character studies are what REALLY get to the heart of the team, and reveal why, however unstoppable they were in 1986, by 1987 they were already a team on the decline and, despite their return to the playoffs in 1988, the Mets were a franchise on the verge of collapse heading into the 1990's. Whether it was the ill-advised trade of Kevin Mitchell (shipped out because management feared that he would be a bad influence on Dwight Gooden and Strawberry, despite the fact that those two were already heavily into drugs and alcohol) or the constant tinkering with Gooden's mechanics and pitch selection in order to make him a \\"better\\" pitcher (despite his coming off a 1985 in which he dominated NL hitters en route to the Cy Young Award), you get a firsthand view of just how the 1986 Mets were destined to be a team for the ages and then fizzle out just as quickly.Some fans may be shocked when they hear some of the stories and realize just how flawed those Mets were (and how some STILL are), but for anyone who lived through the summer and fall of 1986, this book is required reading."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

A Season of Brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball with Straw, Doc, Mookie, Nails, The Kid, and the Rest of the 1986 Mets, the Rowdiest Team Ever to Put on a New York Uniform--and Maybe the Best","review":"I loved the book for granting a reader the real behind-the-scenes look at how the 1986 Mets were assembled, how they managed to execute so well for one season, and how it could never last. Really, the epilogue is almost unnecessary since Met fans and most baseball diehards know how it played out in the subsequent years. The beauty and quality of the book is in the background material: it explains what the beat writers have always know, what real insiders just assume as common knowledge amongst themselves, and confirms some of the best and worst suspicions I've always had about the players and management.See, I loved watching Gooden pitch, I tried to emulate that easy motion as much as I could, but I never had the talent, not even close. I knew something was wrong in 1986 but hey, they won it all... but in 1987, it could no longer be ignored. His waste of talent, the mismanagement of his ability, all there to be seen as early as 1986, 1987. There was enough time to rectify the situations, really, but the sad truth is all too common: many of us lack the kind of courage and will to overcome our problems, much less face them.As sad as Gooden's decline was, Staweberry's was irrevocably tinged with meanness that almost made it a just outcome. Still, talent wasted is common and always tragic.What I liked most about the book, then, was the confirmations of my opinions about most the crew that I'd considered, and the revelations I did not. For example, I always admired Keith Hernandez and the book gave him additional depth of character that made him my favorite Met again (Sorry Edgardo Alfonzo). For another example, that Gary Carter was really all about himself was a bit of a surprise to me, because he played a selfless position on-field. I could see it, I admit its truth, but it's still a bit of a dichotomy.In all, a terrific book and a quick read. I withheld the fifth star because clearly, the author dislikes Strawberry intensely and it showed in the depictions. True or not, I could see the author's contempt and while I agree with it, I tried to view and evaluate the book as a historian might, so I put the ding there.This is the kind of sports writing I would love to see published daily/ weekly. It's too bad you can only read about what really happened in 1986 in 2007, when enough time has passed to expire the statute of limitations on any kind of material consequence.-C"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

It was clear even then that this was a team you did not want to take to Sunday Mass.Remarkably, in between the drugs, womanizing, copious consumption of alcohol, animal mutilation, gambling, and barroom brawls, the '86 Mets were able to play good enough baseball to win a World Series championship. And it was not just that they won, but how they won that made this team so memorable. First, by defeating the Houston Astros in dramatic fashion to win the NLCS, and then the Boston Red Sox in what has to be one of the greatest World Series ever played, especially Game 6. When you read Parlman's account, it is amazing this team did not fold under the pressures so many of its players inflicted upon themselves. Of course, they did not collapse, in spite of themselves, and they won simply because they were that good of a team.You also wonder how great this team could have been had so many of its players not self destructed. It is a question we will never know the answer to, but we know what happened in 1986, and Pearlman's in-depth coverage of the Mets that year gives a baseball fan useful insights into this troubled team's foibles and complexities."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

On april 22nd of that year my Aunt Marge and Uncle Nick invited me to go with them with their two daughters to see my first Mets game at Shea Stadium. Sure, we were in the Upper Deck, four miles away from the action, but as Tom Seaver struck out the last ten Padres he faced and finished with a major leage tying record 19 strikeouts for the game, I was hooked. Even though I was an awful baseball player at the age of 8 and 9 (I never even got on base without either being walked or hit by a pitch until I was ten, and then it was either by an error or a fielder's choice) by eleven years old I finally was able to take advantage of some god-given talent, and by 12 years old was on the little league All-Star team. I was a shortstop by this time, but my passion was pitching. The numbers on uniforms didn't go up to 41 at the time, so I wore #5 (4 + 1) to show my allegience to Seaver. I would try to scrape my right knee on the clay with every pitch, and the moleskin on my right spike would have to be replaced every few games from dragging through the dirt. I was a Seaver wannabe through and through, and even into my high-school playing days, when Seaver was ultimately dealt to the Reds in 1977, my love of Seaver and his perfect delivery and pitching motion made me continue to emulate Seaver, although I remained a Mets Fan.In 1973 my heart was broken by the A's, as they beat the team I so desperately was rooting for. Even though I had a great time watching them dismantle what I felt was a superior Reds team to get to the World Series (the pummeling of Bud Harrelson by Pete Rose not withstanding), I had never felt the joy of winning the ultimate series, and felt the void had to be filled, especially living amongst many Yankee fans in southwest Connecticut.Finally, in 1986, I realized my ultimate goal of experiencing a World Series Championship was going to be accomplished. The fact that my college roomate (a Sox fan from Enfield, CT) called me when Boston was one out away from clinching the series made it that much more special.The book brought back a lot of special memories for me. I'm not sure I had to be reminded about all of the drugs that were ingested during that time by the Mets (and their fans), but all in all it was a good book and took me only a few hours to read.My mother-in-law, perhaps one of the gretaest Mets fans ever (since 1962)and perhapps the best Lenny Dykstra fan to grace the planet (she denies he ever hit the juice)gave the book to me for Christmas after she read it first, and also enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Jeff Pearlman makes the case that this was the last team of old school party boys to win a title before the onset of a more corporate era where the wackiest thing that ever happens is a rookie getting a shaving cream pie in the face.

The Red Sox were this close to beating the curse,someone had even flashed \\"Congratulations Red Sox\\" before being told to get it off. Bob Costas was standing with the commissioner's trophy, preparing his comments for presentation. Some members of the Mets had already cracked open a beer and then....theball rolled between Buckner's legs and the game took on a whole new weird life.The unlikely finish of the 1986 season sometimes overshadows the cast of the 1968 Mets,an extraordinarily gifted group of athletes. Darryl Strawberry, Dwight Gooden, Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, Lenny Dykstra, Bobby Ojeda. Abundant talent and a never ending wild streak. New Yorkers were quick to embrace their Mets and the Mets tried to embrace as many fans as they could. New York was still raunchy and Davey Johnson kept a very loose reign on the team. Drugs,women, booze,women,huge egos,fame,women it was all there for the taking as long as they kept winning.Alone, most of the players were conventional and mild mannered. Combined they became combustible.. food fights on the team charter became riots. This wildly talented and diverse group became a family (the one you might see on Jerry Springer these days) andan unbeatable unit. Later, Bobby Ojeda would remark to Jeff Pearlman\\"you're gonna find we were a vile bunch of f@#*!rs\\". Davey Johnson promised the team would win,and they did. They were fun to watch and to read about. Even a die hard Texas Rangers fan like me had to keep up with the Wild Bunch.

I was delighted to look back at rivalries and the different personalities\\" of each team. Mets' management, worried aboutthe antics of the \\"Wild Bunch\\" began to break the team up.

Back then, they were the exception; today they are the norm.I loved this team as a kid. Still love them today. I am unabashedly biased in my love for their story so to recommend this book based solely on the narrative would not be credible. However, I will say this: when I am feeling down about my team (whichever one is in season at the time), I pick up this book and read it again. Why? Because behind all the booze, broads, and bats that the book details, there's a story about how a championship team was developed. If you read the chapter about the Mets hiring Frank Cashen as their GM and what he did to put Doc, Straw, Keith, and The Kid on the field, you'll realize that your team might actually be about 2 seasons from greatness.So I read the book to give me hope.

Although I lived through every exhilarating and incredible moment of the Mets' 1986 season and post-season, I--like most fans--was unaware of most of what was going on off the field. Pearlman tells the warts-and-all story (and trust me, there are a lot of warts) of the individual players and the team as a whole. His unflinching drive to tell the truth about the 1986 Mets helps him create a compelling and three-dimensional tale of passion, arrogance, stupidity, and triumph. Pearlman obviously likes his subject, but he doesn't let his feelings get in the way of telling the truth--this is the complete story, from George Foster's unfounded accusations of managerial racism to Ray Knight's redemption and ultimate rejection. Reading this book made me want to re-watch the entire 1986 post-season--the insights Pearlman supplies will help you understand why the 1986 NY Mets' World Series victory was the most stirring and amazing victory in sports history--and no, that's not hyperbole."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Dwight Gooden and Daryl Strawberry simply threw their talents away. On the other end of the spectrum was Gary \\"the Kid\\" Carter. His squeaky clean image, big smile, and exuberence in front of the camera rubbed practically everyone the wrong way. Opposing players hated him and his own teammates couldn't stand him, mostly because he wasn't like them. He wasn't a drinker, a carouser, a brawler... mostly, he wasn't cool. He was a big geek and like bullies in a schoolyard, thugs can't stand a geek.The last few pages take us to the present day, and how each of these guys are faring almost twenty years later.

The New York Mets were expected to do great things with their collection of stars and their 108 win regular season. However, the playoffs were far from easy for them, with some miracles (including a Boston meltdown) helping them along the way to their second World Series title in history. Most of this is well known by the casual baseball fan.What is less-known are the exploits of this group of meglomaniacal, immature misfits throughout the course of that crazy 1986 season. Pearlman's look back as a guy who has grown up now but was only a young kid at the time is truly fantastic. You'll read about Doc and Darryl's run-ins with drug accusations, entire team food fights on airplanes, who had the worst gas (Doug Sisk), and the circumstances of how four Mets found themselves arrested by overzealous cops in Texas.If you're a baseball fan, you'll enjoy this easy read. It's nonstop fun and never seems to have slow moments. An added bonus is that you need not be a Mets fan to enjoy this book -- it's a tale of adult immaturity and debauchery that anyone with a sense of humor and a love of baseball can (and will) enjoy."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Because of his background I was expecting a hard hitting, no holds barred, expose about a team that should have been a dynasty but was destroyed by questionable management and drug abuse. This team alone carried Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry at the very crossroads of superstardom and tragedy, not to mention recovering, and at the time disgraced, former MVP Keith Hernandez, and constant trouble makers Lenny Dykstra & Kevin Mitchell and a slew of other colorful characters (especially the always forgettable Tim Teufel). However Pearlman fails to deliver with this book. Instead of giving us a historical perspective, an opportunity to look at the teams blemishes along with its successes, he gives us a cliche filled (even more than this review), self serving, glossing over of an entire season, from the point of view of an ex-jock, alomst as if this book had been ghost-written by Ron Darling, much similar to the 10,000 books cranked out over the past 12 months regarding the Red Sox 2004 championship. So if your a baseball fan from outside of New York City skip this one, because you won't find anything in here that you didnt already know and couldnt find on baseball-reference.com. However if your looking for a quick read that you could sit down and finish in a couple of days or are a Mets fan looking to re-live the glory days I would recommend this title."},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Happily I dug into this book with the hopes of recalling nostalgic images and events from my childhood. To my surprise, by about 10 pages into the book, I absoluetly loathed just about every single member of the '86 Mets! The drinking, the boozing, the sex, the fights, the drama and the personalities all read like they were from an early draft of the \\"Major League\\" film script. Amazin'ly, this book is all true! It chronologically details the events that lead up to that championship season and their unbelievable '86 campaign which brought home our first commish trophy since '69. The book includes wonderful in-game stories as well as the MANY off-field antics which made this team legendary. This is the only book I have ever read, aside from Howard Stern's \\"Private Parts,\\" that actually made me laugh out loud. It is the perfect summer read, and it should be on every Mets fans' bookshelf. Enjoy the stories, the heartbreak, the laughs and the good memories. Then turn on MSG and wonder what went wrong. Let's Go Mets!!"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

Now leading off, \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\"I was already reading two other books when I came across this one about the 1986 Mets. Needless to say, neither Lewis & Clark nor Robert Langdon were able to evoke the sheer joy that this collection of batters, brawlers and boozers will forevermore.Though a rough and tumble group, their never-say-die attitude is an inspiration. That group of men forever erased the word \\"quit\\" from a 15 year-old boy's vocabulary that autumn, and the storied summer it capped was the thing of dreams.Mex, Lenny, Hojo, Wally, Roger, Mookie, Jesse, Rafi - they're here in all their gritty glory. But it's refreshing to hear from the Ed Hearns and Doug Sisks, too, for it paints a broader and probably more accurate picture. I especially liked the fact that the book didn't dwell extensively on the tired tales of Gooden and Strawberry. What more can or even needs to be said about these two? The book is fast-paced, belabors no points and it's just when you notice you can't put it down that you also realize that it perfectly captures the whirlwind that was these Mets.It's embarrassing to think I idolized such a collection of misfits and miscreants, though despite their collective obnoxiousness it's hard not to like individuals such as Ojeda, Hernandez, Backman, Wilson, etc. For all their faults, I admire how downright genuine they seem. It's also surprising to discover that some other Mets were such shabby people. I'm still shaking my head over a week later...The team had it's saving graces, thankfully, as not all of the players fit the mold. Some were quiet, attended chapel regularly, were faithful to their wives and didn't drink or do drugs. I got the sense that this brought a much-needed humility and grace to what otherwise seems like a tempest of amped-up arrogance. Many of these same individuals are still employed in varying capacities by the Mets and that speaks volumes.What's especially interesting is the seemingly divine script that played itself out over the course of the year; The bar fight in Cooters, the Astros winning the NL West, Ojeda the ex-Red Sock, Schiraldi the ex-Met, the prodigal son returning - it's astounding to consider the undercurrent of sub-plots and themes that flowed beneath that immortal season.I also got the unfortunate impression that for as favorably as the baseball gods looked down on the Mets that year, they were disproportionately (or perhaps not?) cruel in collecting their dues in subsequent years.But like the author states, in this age of slate-suited, politically correct and milquetoast ballplayers, the 1986 Mets stand as a testament not only to a cocky, cavalier brand of baseball but also to a close and confident group of men that, despite their failings both to themselves and others, somehow came together to form a team in the truest sense and prove that it aint braggin' if you can back it up.A vaunted, vile, victorious and simply Amazin' read. How about a curtain call, Jeff Pearlman?"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

It covers the rise of the 1986 squad and its successes and failures in a thoroughly engaging way. I particularly enjoyed how Pearlman highlights members often overlooked in discussions of this team (such as Kevin Mitchell and Davey Johnson).I recommend readers check this out from a library rather than purchasing it because 1) as others have noted, it does feel like a long Sports Illustrated article or a Kindle Single that doesn't end and 2) some of the writing is awful.

It is decent but after a while you just get tired at how adolescent ballplayers are. What passes for pranks (hot foots, shaving cream) in MLB seems even less inventive that high school kids. Throw in the fact that ballpalyers could go out and get blind drunk pretty much after every game yet perform at the highest level the following day is mindboggling. Of course, it caught up the '80s Mets as guys like Strawberry and Gooden really derailed what started off as sure Hall of Fame careers.The last five chapters focuses on the NLCS and the World Series so there's more than enough \\"baseball\\" writing to suffice.The problem I had is after you've read about one ballplayer's drinking habits or another faith in God, I just got tired of all that. I loved the Mets at the time as they were a fun team to watch. After reading this, it hasn't changed my opinion of that season but it sure changes my opinion of some players--basically the majority are a bunch of jerks and idiots...and I include the Christians with the drunks on that score. Would it kill ballplayers to actually treat the game with a semblance of respect no matter who the owner or GM is?Anyway, if you're looking for a great look at the '86 season, this I'd rate no more than a salacious insider's tale. Good for what is is but been there, done that, read this before. (Plus what is up with the longest subtitle in book publishing history?)"},{"Title":"The Bad Guys Won!

What a great read.Being from Australia, the 1986 World Series was my 6th year of watching baseball. (At the time these were the only 5 - 7 games televised to Australia each year).I was hoping Boston would win due to the number of years since they had won a World Series. I still remember watching the 6th game at about 2am when that ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs. Terrible!!This book gave a good insight into the Mets & their opponents that year.I have to give special mention to the chapter on Bill Buckner; before the ball went between his legs. He will always be remembered for this one play. Jeff Pearlman did a wonderful thing writing that chapter to give us a whole picture of this player. It was one of the highlights of the book.

Of particular interest to me was the section on feng shui and the 5 Chinese elements, as it provided a comprehensive (although somewhat basic) description of some of the main concepts involved. It also covers crystal healing, chakras, color breathing, and, intriguingly, color foods.

In the beginning, Timon is (not to put too fine a point on it) stupidly philanthropic; in the end he is equally misanthropic. When Timon is on top of the world, we have the cynical Apemantus to be our voice and let him know what a fool he is. In the last two acts, we simply wish (I do, at least) that our hero would stop complaining and let us &quot;pass and stay not here,&quot; as he would have all men do in his epitaph.But a recording is to be judged on its performances, not so much on its text. The Arkangel series, now in its last laps toward completion before (I am told) it is all redone on CDs, has every reason to be proud of its &quot;Timon of Athens,&quot; thanks to its strong and intelligent readings. The opening scenes of artisans and poets building up the play's themes of wheel-of-fortune and gratitude/ingratitude are almost intelligible without a text open before you. Alan Howard, whom I saw in New York long ago as Henry V and as the main character in &quot;Good,&quot; has that kind of friendly voice that is so well suited to the extravagant Timon in the open acts that we feel all the more for him when his false friends deny him in his need.The snarling voice of Norman Rodway's Apemantus is a perfect counterpoint, and he casts out his invective in those early scenes with a hint of humor. However, when Timon becomes the misanthrope, his voice darkens and coarsens; and it is very hard to tell it from Apemantus' in their overly-long exchange of curses in 4:3. If the actor playing Alcibiades (Damian Lewis) sounds far too young for the role, that is a minor quibble--and perhaps the director wanted him to sound like a young Timon.The incidental music sounds sufficiently Greek but too modern; still, Ingratitude knows no particular time period. A superior production of a much flawed play and a very welcome addition to any collection of recorded drama, especially since the old Decca set is long out of print and Harper audio does not yet have a &quot;Timon&quot; in their series."},{"Title":"Timon Of Athens","review":"Timon of Athens has often been thought the work of a madman. Disjointed, polemical, irrational, and downright inelegant, many have thought that Shakespeare (or whosoever it may be) suffered a mental breakdown. These and other factors culimate in what I believe to be a tragic under-appreciation of this play.This play is NOT the story of a naively generous soul who eventually \\"faces reality\\". This is instead the story of a glorious Dionysian self-expender, who, upon realizing the cowardly conservatism of his so-called \\"peers\\", runs off to the wilds, to lavishly waste himself in body and soul. He dies on a curse, the climax of all the \\"evil wind\\" he has been sending out, the ultimate dissipation, his ultimate glory. The \\"tragedy\\" of the play is the cold stone tablet that lies atop his corpse at the end, and the message of frugality it seems to espouse."},{"Title":"Timon Of Athens","review":"Many people feel that this play of Shakespeare's is either unfinished or a poor effort. But I do not think this is accurate or fair. The reality is that many people can never find a middle ground. It is actually (in my opinion) quite common for people to only be able to see things from one extreme or the other. Despite Apemantus' cynical nature, there is no denying that whatever his faults are, HE DOES HAVE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE when he tells Timon: &quot;The middle of humanity thou never knewest,/ but the extremity of both ends....&quot; (4.3.342-343). Critics also tend to think Apemantus is unlikable, but are we missing a crucial point? I can not help but think Shakespeare is commenting on the fact that more people DON'T have a concept of reality. Apemantus refuses to join in the delight when Timon thinks highly of his false friends. Apemantus is aware of reality and no one wants to hear it. In my opinion Timon and Apemantus are VERY TRUE to life. In addition, the roll of Flavius is very touching. He can not dessert his master even when he knows (or thinks) Timon has nothing. Finally, I can not over estimate the mastery of Shakespeare when first Timon has money, he can not do enough for his so called friends and when he has nothing they dessert him. When Timon through fate gains a second fortune, he does not turn back into what he was, but rather he uses his 2nd fortune to destroy Athens. It is interesting that Shakespeare derived this play on the legend of 'Timon the Manhater,' and decides to take it a step further and show how he got there. And how much more realistic could Shakespeare have made this than by first showing Timon as a 'manlover?' Many people feel Timon should have somehow found the middle of humanity, but if he had, that would have defeated the whole purpose of this excellent play."},{"Title":"Timon Of Athens","review":"Apparently a direct transcription of the physical book's text, the Kindle edition of this play is very poorly formatted. Line-breaks are muddled and the editorial notes get mixed up in the play-text proper. Very disappointed that Pelican would do this -- I imagine they simply wanted an easy way onto the ebook market and didn't think about the mechanics of what they were doing at all. If you need electronic Shakespeare, get it somewhere else."},{"Title":"Timon Of Athens","review":"Timon of Athens is a good man. He helps friends, he plays hosts to one and all, he lends money freely, he believes himself loved by all. He is a sap and a sucker.Timon then finds himself in need of help. Not much, but it is vital he gets it. His friends disappear. At a loss he falls into despair and sees the world for what it is: a cold place full of ungrateful freeloaders. The universe is indifferent to his needs. With the few coins left him, he gives one last dinner for his fair weather friends, which they attend. Who knows? Perhaps the foul weather has turned for the better.Unlike Scrooge who has ghosts visit nightmares upon him, for Timon it is reality that visits nightmares upon him. Scrooge's visions of horror turn him to perform good deeds to atone for his past miserly ways. Timon's wretched experiences of treachery have him repudiate all past good deeds.He feeds stones to his guests. He forsakes them, his life, and all human company. He seeks solace on the windswept seashore, in the wrack of a storm.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Timon Of Athens","review":"It's unfortunate that TIMON OF ATHENS was never finished, because it could have ranked with Shakespeare's best. There is certainly enough excellent writing to make this play worthwhile, but beware, there are poorly fleshed-out characters, jarring speeches, and undeveloped themes. Still, amidst the chaos is a very poignant story of a man who learns what just about every character in every Shakespeare play eventually learns: &quot;there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.&quot;The Arden edition is especially rcommended. Editor H.J. Oliver takes the Arden's usual conservative approach to emendations of the text, and gives clear notes to difficult passages. One of the best in the Arden series."},{"Title":"Timon Of Athens","review":"Timon, a wealthy, generous Athenian, is a man who never hesitates to help his friends in need. However, when he falls in dire straits and is forced to sell his property, he is deserted by all those who know him. Afflicted with a venomous hatred of mankind, he retreats into the forest, adopts a diet of roots and denounces his fellow humans in soliloquies of the most towering passion and most bitter invective. &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; should rank amongst Shakespeare's greatest and most renowned tragedies. It is a mature work, displaying much linguistic virtusoity, charm of expression and highly imaginative images and allegories. It is hard to imagine why so many critics are dead-set against acknowledging it for the masterpiece it is. It possibly contains the direst abuse of human fickleness and folly and the most nihilistic (and most moving) yearning for death and extinction on the part of the maligned Timon. The real stealer of the play, however, is Timon's foil, the philosopher, Apemantus. Embodying the most systematic misanthrophy, he smilingly and scornfully looks on Timon's open-handedness during his days of prosperity. Their encounter later in the forest is one of the most gripping of confrontations in literary history, containing some of the most exciting exchanges and the most inflammatory put-downs. A sadly unrecognised masterpiece."},{"Title":"An essay on the trial by jury","review":"This book, which was written in the 19th century, is as vital and significant today as the Constitution-and perhaps more important to the modern reader because of changes mad within the court system (but not the legal system) in the past century.This is a very short book, but covers a very important and neglected part of the limitations of Government power: the trial by jury.Jury trial rights predate the foundation of the United States, beginning with the signing of the Magna Carta in England in 1215. So the principles of jury trial were long established in the British Common Law upon which US Federal Law and most states (all but Louisiana, which is based upon Napoleonic Law.)\\"FOR more than six hundred years that is, since Magna Carta, in 1215 there has been no clearer principle of English or American constitutional law, than that, in criminal cases, it is not only the right and duty of juries to judge what are the facts, what is the law, and what was the moral intent of the accused; but that it is also their right, and their primary and paramount duty, to judge of the justice of the law, and to hold all laws invalid, that are, in their opinion, unjust or oppressive, and all persons guiltless in violating, or resisting the execution of, such laws.\\"The purpose of a selected jury is to represent the population or country as a whole to judge the defendant, who represents the rights of the people. (i.e. the people as a whole, represented by the jurors, decide whether or not they desire the freedom to perform whatever actions are on trial.)The purpose of trial by jury, is to permit a \\"trial by country,\\" opposed to a \\"trial by Government.\\" Thus, in the final analysis, it is up to the people to determine which laws have been set by their Government they truly wish to obey, and not the Government'swill alone.This is not the model, which they taught you in school, and it is at variance with the statements frequently made in court by judges. (Whose purpose in a jury trial is not to judge, but to provide order safety and advice.)With an informed jury, no law may be enforced which the jury finds reprehensible, regardless of the opinions of the judges, legislators or police. Juries have the final say in whether or not a law is just and enforceable.Truly, if this were otherwise, Tyranny is the result. If the Government declares the law, and the Government determines whether or not the law is valid, then the Peoiple have lost their freedom, and have only those freedoms left which the Government chooses to leave to them.The legal mechanism is thus: The Legislature creates the law, the Executive puts the law into effect, and enforces the law, the Courts (in the form of the Jury, a randomly selected subset of the People,) determine if the law is valid. In our last hundred years, increasingly the function of the Courts, represented by the Jury, has come to be represented by the Judges, who are, of course, not a random selection of the People, but a selected part of the Government.Our current Government has gone so far as to say that it will continue to hold (at least some) defendants, even if they are found innocent!I highly recommend that all people subject to jury duty (adult citizens) read this book. Despite being written well over 100 years ago, it is quite clearly written, and being short and important to your liberty, will pay great dividends for the little time invested in reading. If you read one book this year, let this be the one."},{"Title":"An essay on the trial by jury","review":"To properly understand the reason for the system of trial by jury one can do no better than to read Spooner's essay. He covers the history of the concept and the proper role of the &quot;judge&quot; and the rights of the jury. The concept of Jury Nullification and the need for it become clear with a reading of his work. One reading of Spooner's essay and you will never view our judicial system in the same light."},{"Title":"An essay on the trial by jury","review":"This book gives an eye opening look at our judicial system and why the trial by jury is so important. As one of the checks and balances of our constitution, it allows \\"the people\\" to keep government from issuing oppressive laws. They are the final arbiter of a laws fairness by their decision to convict or acquit. Despite the fact that judges and lawyers and others try to make a jury work \\"within\\" the system, the fact is, juries are allowed, encouraged and expected to judge the laws for themselves as members of the community as to their fairness. This process is called jury nullification. By this act, juries keep what laws they deem as meaningful, fair and honest. The rest are simply ignored. This is true in murder vs. self-defense, taxes, anything.Spooner basically asserts that without this time honored tradition; that if a judge, lawyer or any official of the court or government can limit a jury to work strictly within the law that the trial is no longer a trial by jury or \\"the people\\" but a trial by the state, with an outcome that can be dictated and decided by it as well. In fact, even the act of a judge not allowing evidence in for consideration voids the trial and should immediately result in dismissal. The jury is allowed to hear all evidence, despite what technicality it is not allowed in for. They are the sole arbiter of what is right and wrong, good or evil. It is felt that no great knowledge of law is necessary to decide if someone is guilty or innocent and even if a law was broken the jury has every right to find a person innocent if they feel that what transpired was the right thing to do.I recommend this book for those interested in freedom, justice and the constitution. It also gives excellent history of the trial by jury going back to its inception under the Magna Carta."},{"Title":"An essay on the trial by jury","review":"Spooner paints a picture of how judgement and sentence by jurycan be used to protect liberty from an overreaching government!"},{"Title":"An essay on the trial by jury","review":"Interesting book brought it for me dad ended up reading it as well so nice I just love to read educational books"},{"Title":"An essay on the trial by jury","review":"The content of this book is vital to our understanding of the trial by jury, both broadening and ennobling the contemporary role of juror.The book itself, however, is saturated with typographical errors.

A reading quickly shows that this \\"realist\\" in the study and teaching of American Diplomatic History and foreign relations in general has used this foremat to continue his distinguished university teaching career (Iowa State; Univ. of Illinois; Univ. of Virgina, principally). All who have had academic lives at the first rank will read with empathy; those of us who achieved less stature will quickly find out why they didn't rise to the very top.For the author (born in 1915) was a dedicated worker who cherished high ambitions and sacrificed to seek perfection. Enroute, he encountered poverty and underemployment, a detour into the military, two different doctoral programs (Oklahoma; Chicago), and ever-increasing distinction in lecturing and scholarly publications. \\"...I experienced two lives,\\" he says, the second of which was \\"rather a smooth ascending venture that ultimately reached heights beyond what I could anticipate.\\"My own memoir (An Independent Scholar in Twentieth Century America; 1996) is twice as long but half as penetrating. Ever the historian, Graebner never gets far away from the major episodes of war in the history of the United States. He takes a \\"realist\\" view, coining (or converting) a term not in large dictionaries, \\"triumphalist,\\" to describe the moralist/idealist; humanist/Wilsonian interpretations of others. He praises \\"accommodation\\" and has no use for confrontations of the Cold War, Korean, or Vietnam kind, which the Founding Fathers would have avoided in the name of detached national existence.Graebner's book The New Isolationism (1956) won him general recognition beyond that which his more orthodox historical writings brought. Targeted was the Eisenhower/Dulles aim of containment of communism, especially the unrealizable goal of freeing Eastern Europe. Graebner \\"loathed\\" the Soviet Communist System, but he never feared it, he declares. However interpreted, this reads strangely to this reviewer.Nevertheless, the author sees the years of coexistence as a \\"golden age\\" free of major conflicts like World Wars I and II. In a dozen and more large books he has done all he could to advance his views, taking some lumps from critics enroute. This memoir should be read for his uncompromising views on America's relations with other states in 1846 and 1963-76, and as a reminder that when a scholar gives all he has in him for generations the results will be monumental and the rewards will turn out to be ultimately gratifying."},{"Title":"What Makes Pornography \\"Sexy\\"? (Thistle series)","review":"The Pose Workshop starts as an intriguing idea: Take pictures from magazines such as Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, and have men duplicate the poses in them in front of a crowd. The idea is to make men feel the emotions that women run through when they pose. And this book is excellent in the level of detail it goes through to describe how to put on the workshop to achieve optimal results. Unfortunately, I bought the book because I wanted to hear different voices giving their reactions to the experience, and answering the title question. In practice, the title question is never addressed; the closest we get to it is one-sentence sound bites given as typical of people going through the experience. I also think there is a subtle rigging of the workshop to create the desired effect; having a crowd of people shouting out suggestions on how to duplicate a pose is very different from having a photographer (who you've already created some rapport with) make suggestions. I've done some nude photography, and it is nothing like the experience as related in this book. I think the author acted in good faith when writing this book, but I'm not at all sure the results are valid."},{"Title":"What Makes Pornography \\"Sexy\\"? (Thistle series)","review":"As another reviewer noted, this book does little to address the question of the title. What it does do is describe in detail a \\"workshop\\" the author designed to offer men a different perspective on pornography. While the author clearly has personal opinions on the impact of pornography, he mostly keeps these to himself, as he says he does in his workshops.Stoltenberg created a workshop in which men imitate in detail the poses and facial expressions of models in pornographic magazines. Others watch and offer suggestions to accurately reproduce the pose. Participants then take part in a guided discussion to help understand the experience. Stoltenberg says having men assume these poses, and seeing other men do so (instead of women, who we are more accustomed to seeing) almost always brings about an entirely new way of understanding pornography and how it affects both the audience and the models.This book would be most useful for a person or group planning to run such a workshop themselves, as Stoltenberg lays out in great detail every step of his process. In some ways, this is more a manual of such a workshop than anything else, with added description of the author's own experience of participants' reactions."},{"Title":"What Makes Pornography \\"Sexy\\"? (Thistle series)","review":"I would think that if Stoltenberg wanted his test subjects to really gain empathy with women who pose for erotic pictures he would have paid them. After all, many women who have that livelihood are indeed well paid. I am not surprised that this portion of the context was lost on Stoltenberg. This is a predictable, politically correct take on pornography consistent with standard academic interpretations.

Abbott, who was a Chaplin in the 13th Armored Regiment of the 1st Armd Div in WWII, is one mans story of service in North Africa and Italy. Being told from the perspective of a \`man of the cloth' \\"Nazi 88 Made Believers Signed\\" is relatively unique in WWII historiography, and for that reason alone makes for an interesting and valuable read. Yet it is the story itself that draws the reader in and paints a starkly dark and depressing picture of war. The account Chaplin Abbott gives of his experiences make one realize that Army Chaplin are an rare breed of men who spent as much time with the dead as the living. Certainly the armed footslogger who manned the foxholes in Europe and Asia bore the brunt of the physical and emotional battle scars, but it is also fair to say that the world the Chaplin's lived in would leave most men emotionally spent if not for their Faith. This reviewer picked up \\"Nazi 88 Made Believers Signed\\" in the course of doing research on a great uncle who was a tank gunner in the 13th Armored Regiment/Tank Battalion in WWII. Not knowing quite what to expect I was struck by the loneliness a Chaplin must have felt spending so much time on grave detail and tending to the spiritual needs of the soldiers on the front. Who cared for the Chaplin's? Clearly in the case of Chaplin Abbott, God is the answer, short and simple. Abbott's Faith comes through clearly in the text (though generally not \`preachy') and makes one realize, independent of ones own personal faith, that spirituality got a great many men through their trials in war, and without the Chaplin's who ministered to them the men who emerged from that war and took their places in society thereafter would have been much different - and this is the conclusion of an agnostic! \\"Nazi 88 Made Believers Signed\\" is a short read (150 pp) that one can get through quickly. While it doesn't provide much in the way of new combat information or bigger picture insights, it is unique in its emotion.

That our educational system does not give the same attention to Anne Hutchinson's life, as is afforded to the \\"founding fathers\\", is compelling proof of the sexist nature of recorded history. Eve LaPlante, though a direct descendant of Anne Hutchinson, handles this work with both objectivity and thoroughness. Her book filled in a large gap in my knowledge of early New England. After reading this book, you will never again think of Massachusetts as that charming land of happy pilgrims and may develop, as I have, a deep antipathy for John Winthrop, a man revered in our history books, largely as a consequence of ignoring his cruelty to greater persons such as Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"A fine biography of one of Colonial America's most fascinating people, Anne Hutchinson. A well-researched work as to people, places, and the arcane theological disputes between Mistress Hutchinson and Governor John Winthrop. The author, a direct descendant of Ms. Hutchinson has written a balanced account-- given the environment -- of the cracks in religious orthodoxy which those in power thought a threat to the City on the Hill. I loved the book. A retired lawyer in Minneapolis."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"If you're looking for a role model, there are all kinds of reasons why Anne Hutchinson would make a good one. She showed courage in defying the conventional wisdom of her day. She loved children and small animals, and although we don't know much about her husband he must have cared for her through thick and thin. After all, she was pregnant so many times! Above all, Hutchinson marched to the beat of a different drummer and yet she had the good sense and the fortitude to agree with like minds. When it came to founding the state of Rhode Island, for example, she made a few compromises and agreed to disagree with Roger Williams for the sake of the greater good.Eve Laplante, one of the millions of American descendants of Anne Hutchinson, has written an engrossing, if somewhat limited biography of her honorable ancestor. Laplante excels in bringing us into the real fabric of the early Colonial era, what it felt like to have to make your own soap, to have to deal with native tribes some of whom understandably resented your presence, how it feels to see some of your children die before you. Often she extrapolates from the known facts to bring us a richer sense of period and character. Here and there, she goes too far, but I think on the whole her feats of intuition are by and large helpful."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"American Jezebel is fine biography of Anne Hutchinson, one of the more fascinating women in American history. Ms. LaPlante tells us about Anne the woman, her background, her family and her character, with well researched illuminating details about the Puritan church and colonial life. The theological debates are made as clear as they could be to us, centuries later, and also treats fairly the confrontation between John Winthrop, trying to save his fragile colony,and Mistress Hutchison, a perceived threat. I loved the book."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"I read this book for very selfish reasons. I am descended from both Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer. Consequently, I was interested in learning more about their friendship and their lives.This is a thin book. A mere 288 pages. I would love to see a talented screen play writer turn those pages into a movie. This is the time, in our history, when Anne and Mary would be role models for today's modern women.The book covers Anne's church trial; childhood; marriage; family; mission in life; and ultimately, her death. I would like to see this book placed on the required reading list for high school students. It is a time, in our history, that is barely touched in the schools.As I read the book, I couldn't help but think of the events we see in today's news and how history has a way of repeating. The separation of church and state was no accident. Our founding fathers only had to look at their recent past to understand why religious freedom was vital to the success of our nation.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"I've read quite a few biographies over the last several years, but this one stands out. Anne Hutchinson's tragic story is illustrative of the bizarre outcomes as dogma reaches insane proportions. This biography succinctly captures the times and the arcane nature of the religious arguments that led to Hutchinson's banishment. And it is the sort of tale that led James Madison and the founding fathers to separate church and state.LaPlante's narrative also conveys the absolute hardships of everyday life - especially for women - in colonial America .Based upon a combination of the story it tells and the quality of the writing. I would rate this in the top 100 US biographies.

I also appreciated learning more about Hutchinson's background in England, and about her father's own career in dissent. This research, along with the fluid writing, really made Anne Hutchinson come alive for me, in a way she just hadn't before."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"While we will not find Anne Hutchinson listed among the \\"Founders\\" of America, many historians, including this reader, believe she deserves this recognition for her contributions. In this thought provoking work of history, Eve LaPlante has presented the story of a woman of uncommon courage and determination, while casting a spotlight on some of the less stellar and more troubling parts of American beginnings. When we look at the Puritans, we often look with admiration at a group of believers who refused to compromise their faith regardless of the cost. Yet, while this is undoubtedly a powerful part of who we are, parts of our history show just how quickly we forget and how quickly we change places with those we most detest.LaPlante is a direct descendent of Anne Hutchinson ,whose fascination with her ancestor inspired her to investigate and then to share what she learned. I am indebted to Ms. LaPlante for this fascination and willingness to spend the time and energy in researching and setting forth her story. In fact, although I found no genetic or family links, I find that her story is also my story, for I am a Southern Baptist and, in fact, a (retired) pastor with roots in Methodism, both off-shoots of the turmoil of European religious conflict. I found much to think about in some of my own convictions, and struggles with \\"orthodoxy\\", both from a standpoint of personal convictions and as a leader of a religious community.While telling her own ancestral story, Ms. LaPlante has presented slices of life and customs of 16th and 17th century England and New England. I was fascinated, also, to learn the origins of the name of Boston in Lincolnshire, England (I will let you find it for yourself in her story); and to learn that the one chair in many Puritan homes was to be sat in ONLY by the husband. I was horrified and embarrassed to learn what \\"excessive\\" (my emphasis) zeal for spiritual/Biblical truth can inspire religious leaders to do to those who disagree with them. As a Southern Baptist, I am part of a religious body that for the most part, still rejects women in the pastoral role. I take comfort in believing that my (\\"orthodox\\") interpretation of scripture that supports that stand is based on scripture and not just on personal prejudices, yet I must admit that at least in part, my upbringing would make it difficult for me to accept the pastoral leadership of my spiritual life by a female. Please note that while I and a very large majority of my world-wide denominational fellowship might reject the concept of a woman in pastoral leadership, we allow the freedom of conscience and opinion that is the American prerogative. While we might refuse to personally permit or accept a woman in pastoral leadership in our own individual congregation, and might strongly object to it in other congregations, we also do not \\"excommunicate, harass, or otherwise abuse\\" those who disagree with us. The most we would do would be to declare them to no longer be a member of our church/denomination. As a retired Southern Baptist pastor, I have met and learned to respect the spiritual convictions and practices of my precious sister's United Methodist female pastors and the female pastors of a few other non-Baptist friends. I still don't \\"believe in\\" female pastors, but I don't feel it is right to be unkind, or put myself in God's place.I was also both amazed (even though I have known the American story for many years) that men could flee religious persecution in their home country, and then become religious persecutors almost immediately. Is that a strong warning to us today that perhaps a \\"mad-man\\" may lie just beneath the surface of our own personalities, ready to burst forth given the proper conditions? Or is it also a confirmation of the old axiom that \\"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\"?If the ability to trigger emotional responses is any measure of a good writer, then Ms. LaPlante is certainly a master writer, for I found myself alternately amazed and angered at the self-righteous judgementalism of men of my own profession, and, on the other hand at least understanding and share their concerns and feelings of responsibility for the doctrines taught in the church which I lead. It is interesting to me that I am able to listen to the challenges implicit in her telling of history, some which indict members of my own profession, and hearing her words, feel the urge to apologize to half the world for the absolutely un-Christlike and unbiblical behavior of these self-appointed judges. While I have never treated anyone with the disrespect and unkindness exhibited by these hypocritical and lying shepherds, somehow, I feel responsible for distancing myself and most modern Baptist Christians from them. One more thing I want to say: I fault the Reverend John Cotton more than any of them for his moral and hypocritical cowardice in not standing by his friend and for speaking that which was more politically expedient instead of standing for the Truth. In my mind and in my heart, I found myself wanting to do something I have never done in real life: call him a liar to his face.To sum up my opinion of Eve LaPlante's work, she \\"taught\\" my heart and mind. I consider myself a wiser and more knowledgeable Christian and pastor for her work.Five magnificent stars."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"It is very well written. I appreciate the truth of this history. Genealogist have this lady as one of my direct ancestors. As a child, I used to hear my Grandmother mentioned the name Hutchinson, so I have enjoyed finding this book. Anne Hutchinson was more for religious freedom than the leaders who persecuted her. Separation of Church and State is what has made our Nation great. I think the author did an outstanding job of bringing Anne Hutchinson to life. Thank you."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"A good and interesting historical non-fiction book about Anne Hutchinson, a member of the Boston Puritan community in the mid-sixteen hundreds.Viewed by some as the mother of the American feminist movement, Hutchinson was outspoken, iconoclastic, opinionated and charismatic; characteristics that were unthinkable for a Puritan woman of that era. For her trouble she was excommunicated, imprisoned, banished and ultimately killed in the aftermath. Her \\"crimes\\" were to espouse an alternate opinion to the prevailing community religious doctrine--quite innocuous by today's standards but outrageous at the time.The book depicts the pitfalls of radical religious ideology when there is no effective separation of church and state (think of Muslim Shiria law in the Mideast or Taliban era Afghanistan). Hutchinson's religious \\"transgressions\\" (in word only: her actual life was exemplary) were punished as crimes against the state.The book is detailed and tedious at times, being a historical tome as opposed to a novel. For those interested in early American history, religious evolution and feminist issues, this is a pretty interesting read, although neither compelling nor exciting. I originally picked it up because my own ancestors were New England Puritans and I wanted to see how things were in their day."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"I learned about Anne Hutchinson through a feminist art history class.

An excellent read by an author who has a gift for conveying history in an exciting and fluid manner."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"Anne Hutchinson, a woman, if you please, had the audacity to question the beliefs of John Winthrop and the Puritans in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Hutchinson, whom Winthrop called \\"an instrument of Satan\\", acquired a following while preaching God's grace for salvation rather than achieving it through good works, which Winthrop and most other ministers viewed as an encouragement to \\"do nothing\\" and still expect salvation. Hutchinson's confidence while in the courtroom galled her accusers as they struggled to find something to justify their disgust with her contrary viewpoint. Having been banished from Massachusetts Hutchinson moved to the island of Aquidneck which was then Rhode Island. Hutchinson and six of her children were killed by Siwanoy Indians in what is now part of Pelham Bay Park of the present-day Bronx, New York in 1643. Her nine-year old daughter, Susan, was out picking blueberries at the time and hid in what is called the Split Rock. She was captured and adopted by the Indians, and later returned to Boston and married. The book includes a few maps which prove to be helpful, but I would have liked if pictures had been available of some of the places that were part of her life. I found the book to be worth while to read, but I did find some of the religious rhetoric hard to follow at times."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"It may seem overly technical to some people, but this book continues to perpetuate errors about the legal process used by the Puritans, and clearly readers are not understanding that her civil trial was not a court of Oyer and Terminer like the witch trials in Salem, but a &quot;convention&quot; (a means of trying seditious libel) and her church &quot;trial&quot; was not a civil trial at all, but a hearing by her fellow church members to decide whether she should be excommunicated from the church. The idea that women could not be subject to the law is simply untrue. Women could indeed answer for their own alleged crimes, in the colonies and in England in this period. For Puritans, excommunication did not need to be a permanent removal and many so-called Antinomians were accepted back into their churches. Anne Hutchinson was a woman who stood up against powerful forces, but she had powerful forces behind her. Hutchinson is an inspirational historical figure, but a complex one too. The circumstances of her trial are usually portrayed as persecution, but at a time when the whole Puritan experiment could have gone under, the reactions against her as well as those who supported her can both be understood."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"LaPlante does a wonderful job of bringing her ancestor to life through the court transcripts, but also by bringing to life the world that she lived in. She gives thorough biographies of not just Anne, but her father and her accusers. By giving the reader an understanding of all the players in this drama, Anne's tale is even more powerful. Toward the end of her hearing, you almost want to put your hand over Anne's mouth to stop her lambast of her judges, but at the same time you can't help admiring her courage. The solidity of the early pages dwindles off toward the end, through no fault of LaPlante, because of the paucity of records regarding Anne's last years, we can only get a sketchy outline of her exile. That outline feels like even less because of the fully fleshed out Anne of early in the book."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"I'm mystified by the rave reviews here. Hutchinson is indeed a fascinating figure, but LaPlante's oddly-arranged book obscures more than it illuminates. LaPlante presents Hutchinson as a proto-feminist rather than a zealous religious dissident. Although LaPlante acknowledges that Hutchinson exhibited as much moral certitude as her prosecutors -- she believed, for example, that she could personally identify those chosen for salvation by God -- most of the book either downplays the significance of theological dispute in favor of gender politics (suggesting, e.g., that John Winthrop was principally motivated by a desire to keep women in their place), or twists itself into knots trying to recast arch-Calvinist Antinomianism as a progressive movement. Incredibly, there is no serious discussion of theology until 50 pages into the book.Gender is naturally central to this story. After all, its protagonist is a woman in seventeenth century Boston who brazenly challenged the city's Cambridge-educated male elite. But the reason for Hutchinson's banishment -- like that of the more influential and sophisticated Roger Williams a few years earlier -- was theological, and the faith of Hutchinson and her slippery mentor John Cotton (grandfather of Cotton Mather) was no more rational and no less fanatical than that of John Winthrop, whose conciliatory tendencies actually marked him as a rather moderate fellow by Puritan standards. Unlike Williams, whose radical separatism led him to become one of the first notable advocates of religious freedom, Hutchinson was primarily concerned not with political liberty but with denouncing those who she believed to be under a \\"covenant of works.\\" This category included all the ministers in Massachusetts except for Cotton and her brother-in-law, John Wheelwright.LaPlante does not seem to be an expert on Puritan New England, and she has trouble with theology. To give one example, she employs \\"orthodox\\" as a general term of abuse -- using it at one point to describe the Puritans' Anglican opponents in England, and at others to describe the Puritan leadership in Boston. Like Howard Zinn, who blurbs the book, she seems to view underdog status as an indication of righteousness. A reader who is more interested in ideas than identity politics will note that Hutchinson's Antinomian theology was no more enlightened than that of her \\"orthodox\\" enemies; she was ahead of her time only in her belief that women are as able to interpret scripture as men (no small matter), and in her relatively humane views regarding Native Americans (which she shared with Williams and Samuel Sewall, among others).Of course, historical figures should not be chastised for every transgression against contemporary sensibilities. But as someone with no dog in the fight between the varieties of seventeenth century English Protestantism, I was irritated by LaPlante's verbal gymnastics on behalf of her ancestor -- especially after she declares in the intro that her work will avoid the \\"exaltation\\" found elsewhere. While the reader gets some sense of Hutchinson's admirable qualities, including her sparkling intelligence and stubborn bravery, critical analysis is limited to the occasional throw-away sentence, and the book contains little psychological insight. LaPlante has thus transformed a strange charismatic figure into a cardboard cutout. LaPlante is not, thankfully, the sort of historian who simply dismisses all Puritans as benighted and backwards, but she makes an equally serious mistake in attempting to transform a proud, complex, and extraordinarily devout woman into a digestible hero for contemporary readers.Three final points: (1) LaPlante has a habit of substituting her own language for that of her subjects, making it hard to determine who is saying what. Quotes sometimes end abruptly, replaced by LaPlante's paraphrasing. I suspected at several points that her summaries were generous to Hutchinson (facilitating Hutchinson's transformation into a Puritan Susan B. Anthony), and less than charitable to her prosecutors. The book is at its best when LaPlante isn't speaking at all, since her commentary adds little to the natural drama. (2) The general tenor of the book is hagiographic. Many of the quotes that LaPlante culls from other histories of the era seem to have been included only because they are complimentary of Hutchinson. LaPlante defends her subject in an almost lawerly fashion, informing us, for example, that \\"Harvard University\\" credits Hutchinson with its founding (in fact, one Harvard professor!), and that Hutchinson founded Rhode Island (only technically true, since Williams had established Providence Plantations a year earlier). These are minor details, but combined with the suspicious paraphrasing, they undermined my trust in the author's intentions. An honest defense of Hutchinson would have been fine, but this book seems to lionize its subject using sleight of hand. (3) I learned some things from \\"American Jezebel\\" that I had not found in other books on this period. Particularly interesting were LaPlante's discussions of Lincolnshire and Boston, England.For better books on pre-Revolutionary New England, I recommend Philbrick's Mayflower, Morgan's Puritan Dilemma (on Winthrop), Gaustad's Roger Williams, Lepore's The Name of War (flawed, but erudite and beautifully written), and Richard Francis' wonderful book on Samuel Sewall. American Jezebel isn't worthless, and may be a decent intro to this subject for younger readers, but it would be unfortunate if anyone picked up their whole education on the Puritans here -- as many of the other Amazon reviewers seem to have done."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"As Founder of &quot;The Friends of Anne Hutchinson&quot; on Aquidneck Island (Newport,Portsmouth, Rhode Island)I read &quot;American Jezebel&quot;with the knowledge that most of what we know about Anne Hutchinson were first or second-hand accounts from the men she disturbed and quarreled with. What more could the author glean about this woman who dared to challenge Puritan Boston?On Anne Hutchinson Day (April 27,an annual gathering at Founders' Brook Park in Portsmouth RI, the settlement she co-founded) Our &quot;Friends&quot; group asks -where is the history of the women who came here in 1638? Even their names seem erased. Our mission is to find, collect and record the lost history of women who left Puritan Boston and followed Anne Hutchinson to this Island as wives, sisters, in-laws or servants. Incredibly, 366 years later, many proud descendants are found here with stories to tell of Anne Hutchinson, Mary Dyer(a Quaker martyr)and the women Hutchinsonians. (14 names to date and adding) Many in our group have read everything we can on the life of Anne Hutchinson and her era. We believe this new book is an important addition to the few good, older books that are available on her.Eve LaPlante's &quot;American Jezebel&quot; delivers an account that throws us into the action and weaves us carefully into Hutchinson's world in England, Boston-old world and new- Pocasset(Portsmouth RI) and New York with new detail. Finally an author has given us a meticulously-researched guided tour with maps to the places she lived. I know LaPlante did it well because some of us attempted to research the same areas, including her birthplace in Alford, Lincolnshire England. LaPlante did it right and thoroughly. She seemed to know the interest out there. In this book the early 1600's come alive with the details we want to hear: describing the locales, the living habits and the obsession with religion. Thank you, LaPlante,for clarifying the long civic and church trials of Anne Hutchinson, making them lively and readable for a change.The book provides us with a unique account of how a feisty, literate mother of 16 children leaves the comforts of low-gentry English life, moves to the edge of a wild continent, works as a midwife and counselor to women and evolves into a charismatic spiritual leader who dares to challenge the Boston Magistrates. There is much more after that.

It was Anne Hutchinson, a Puritan immigrant, who caused the first political (and necessarily religious) crisis in the colonies, and her story is told in detail in _American Jezebel: The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans_ (HarperSanFrancisco) by Eve LaPlante. It is a stirring story of conscience and faith, and a refusal to buckle under to men and to the overwhelming religious majority. Hutchinson was truly a hero, and in many ways a founding mother of the republic that would be born more than a century after her death.Hutchinson, wife to a prosperous tradesman who plays little role in her story, immigrated to the Puritan Boston, and within two years caused controversy by holding women's meetings to discuss the weekly Bible reading and the most recent sermon they had heard. LaPlante is very good at describing the sources of Hutchinson's heresy, although Christian churches are quite different now and the tempest then seems very much one in an ancient teapot. The actual heresy matters little; what troubled Governor Winthrop and his fellow leaders was that she was acquiring a following, and that she threatened the status quo by the emphasis on individual conscience. (It was Winthrop who labeled her &quot;American Jezebel;&quot; it is incorrect to say the book has a misleading title since this is how she was known.) Thus in 1637 she was put before a colonial court (which will remind readers of the far more famous ones that condemned the witches in Salem a half century later) to pressure her to recant her heresies. Astonishingly, she conducted herself with such self-confidence (and she was in her sixteenth pregnancy at the time) that she won an acquittal, but she refused to go home quietly. Instead, she started lecturing her accusers, giving them more ammunition.Her profession of direct revelations from God was the basis of a second trial; it really isn't possible to think that such a gathering of men were going to let her go for long. She was excommunicated and banished in 1638. In the unforgiving words of one of her accusers, in Christ's name &quot;... I do deliver you up to Satan, that you may learn no more to blaspheme, to seduce, and to lie!&quot; Thirty families voluntarily went with her in banishment to the new settlement Rhode Island. There they drafted the Portsmouth Compact, which said that &quot;no person within the said colony, at any time hereafter, shall be in any wise molested, punished, disquieted or called into question on matters of religion - so long as he keeps the peace.&quot; This revolutionary and tolerant idea is the direct ancestor of the First Amendment of the Constitution. Hutchinson has also been given backhanded credit for the founding of Harvard College; her heresy inspired the colony to educate ministers who would not allow such sedition. She was to move on to New Amsterdam for further removal from English control, where in 1643 she was killed by Indians; an irony, for she was generous and tolerant to all tribesmen. She has been lauded as a feminist hero, but LaPlante's detailed and instructive biography makes clear that she was more than that. Hutchinson steadfastly refused to keep quiet, refused to have religious ideas imposed upon her, and refused to countenance religious imposition of any type on anyone, and thus she is a hero to anyone who cherishes individual freedom."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"AMERICAN JEZEBEL is a compelling and fast-paced work that offers a colorful close-up on life in colonial America. Eve LaPlante has masterfully created a detailed sense of place and manners in early New England, allowing us to fully engage in the Puritan world of the confident, literate, ever-pregnant and heroic Anne Hutchinson.I have to ask... whose idea was it all these years to hide the story of Anne Hutchinson from the grammar and high school American history student? Anne's biography of conscience and faith is very important and should be celebrated in our schools. The image of Anne, articulate and self-assured, standing up to the array of 40 male judges should be as ingrained as the image of honest Abe Lincoln walking back several miles to a store when he noticed he'd been given one penny too much in change.Read this book. Tell others to read it. And let's get Anne Hutchinson into the school curriculum in the US. LaPlante has done a great service here, so effectively shedding light on Hutchinson's struggle for women's rights and freedom of expression, as well as her outspoken defense of the natives' rights. AMERICAN JEZEBEL of the 1600s has the ring of a modern feminist story, as the issues Hutchinson faced are not so different from issues we face today. Anne Hutchinson's vision, courage and accomplishments are astonishing. I've been thoroughly captured by this book."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"A great portrait of the colonial rebel Anne Hutchinsonthat resonates with issues faced by women today,starting with how to balance home life and work.AMERICAN JEZEBEL also gives us a vivid depiction of17th century Puritan life in Elizabethan England andMassachusetts. The book opens with Hutchinson's trialfor heresy, which is beautifully described andexplained, as a result of which she was banished fromBoston and went on to found the colony of RhodeIsland! This book shows how extraordinary AnneHutchinson was and that, as the first PERSON inAmerica to espouse religious freedom and individualrights, she should be considered our founding mother.What a character! She raised 15 kids, was a midwife,AND could debate theology with the founders of HarvardCollege and make them look foolish (while pregnant forthe 16th time)! The maps of 17th century Boston,Portsmouth, Rhode Island, the Bronx, and Lincolnshire,England alone, along with Laplante's excellent guideto touring these sites of Hutchinson's life, are worththe price of the book."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"This biography written by a decendent of Ann Hutchinson is tremendous. Ann Hutchinson is an American woman that little has been written about and should be taught in all schools so that young girls and boys will know this part of our American history and not just think of the Puritans being the ones who brought us Thanksgiving. The Puritans were a male controlled religion who were as cruel as the religious leaders they fled England from! Eve LaPlante, the author has done her research well. I have never been to Boston or Rhode Island and now am hoping to go someday to trace a portion of our history. Martha Jo Billy"},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"Anne Hutchinson was a courageous woman, for standing up for her beliefs and to men. Unfortunately, she was herself a religious fanatic, with perhaps more tolerance than some - perhaps - but with religious beliefs that in fact on the issue of &quot;justification by works&quot; at least were more extreme that that of her accusers. She did not protest or speak out against puritanical laws - she apparently believed laws against heretics were necessary - she merely wanted to define heretic.Nevertheless, a true heroine for bravery if not for her beliefs. The author, unfortunately, writes a thin book, with many an error on matters of religion, Puritan life, law and customs. With nowhere near enough information about Hutchinson to make a 288 page book, other than records of the proceedings, she dwells at length on them, apparently not understanding the arguments well herself. She also goes on interminably about the details of the altars, tombs, rood screens, etc. etc. of churches in England with only the most tangential relationship to Anne's life, not to mention the insufferably long episode of the author trying to locate the split rock. A book by a non-descendant hopefully would have been able to find more on-point material to fill the almost 300 pages."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"In Puritan Massachusetts, there were fewer rights than today. One of the rights that was lacking was freedom of religious belief. The Puritans were trying instead to create the New Jerusalem where all would follow the same interpretation of Christianity. But under the surface, there were disagreements . . . especially between John Cotton and the other ministers. But Cotton usually tried to smooth over those differences when confronted with them, and then went back to preaching his true beliefs. Anne Hutchinson was a fond adherent of Cotton's ideas, but there was no such leeway for her teachings.American Jezebel focuses on the meetings at which the Massachusetts General Court examined Anne Hutchinson and found her to deserve banishment from the colony, and the subsequent meetings in which her church examined whether she was to be excluded as well. The material is filled with dialogue and shrewd guesses about what the speakers may have been thinking. Ms. LaPlante also makes interesting comments about the background of these confrontations.It's hard to imagine making theological arguments quite this dramatic, but much was at stake in the minds and hearts of the accusers and the accused. Yet the material works well.Ms. LaPlante also does a remarkable job of describing the backgrounds of the key players, the religious disputes, and how the circumstances then compare to those today. There's even a fine section in the end about how you can visit many of the sites described in the book.Ms. LaPlante brings a lot of love and care to this subject. Perhaps that is influenced by being a descendent of Anne Hutchinson, as are three U.S. Presidents (FDR and the two George Bushes).The main drawback of the book is that much of the theological debate is about issues that you may not care much about, the role of whether those who are saved are preordained by God to be in the Elect . . . or whether good works can earn salvation. Many Protestant beliefs today are noticeably different from either of these views. I would have enjoyed the book more if there had been a little less in this area.A nice surprise in the book was the history of Anne Hutchinson's father who preceded her in taking on bold views that were not sanctioned by the church's hierarchy.I also enjoyed the discussion of what a midwife did in those days, and how people interpreted miscarriages and malformed fetuses.Naturally, this book will appeal most to anyone who loves to cheer for the underdog and those whose rights have been ignored. In the Puritan times, women were to be seen and not heard for the most part. Anne Hutchinson's comments on sermons and discussions of the Bible drew a large number of people to her, and this role created a challenge to the male-dominated views of the church leaders. To some extent, her trials were a reflection of discomfort with her wit and courage . . . rather than just what she said. From the dialogues though, it's clear that she had many opportunities to play the meek woman and walk away. But she stood by her convictions and was willing to bear the consequences. That's even more remarkable when you consider that she was 46 and in her 16th and very troubled pregnancy as these meetings occurred. After a walk of 10 miles to the first meeting, she was expected to stand all day while the men were judging her sat.Her banishment also had a large impact on the development of religious freedom as her family and many of her followers left to develop another part of Rhode Island, where religious freedom was permitted. While there, she was still harassed by the Boston ministers, and after her husband's death she moved on to New York where she died in an attack by a local tribe."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"I will be eighty years old in one month and I didn't know about Anne Hutchinson as one of my ancestors until about three years ago.

Until now.Eva LaPlante has the luxury of a well documented life in Anne Hutchinson. From her birth to her death, Anne was the rare non-royal woman of her time to leave her mark and her words. The centerpiece of this book is Anne's trial for \\"traducing\\" the ministers of Boston. Defying the conventions of acceptable behavior, Anne held her own, defending her own actions and quoting scriptures to support her claims. She very nearly won and even LaPlante has to admit that Anne pretty much grab defeat from the jaws of victory.But the Anne Hutchinson in these pages would have gladly taken honorable defeat over kowtowing to those she believed were corrupting the word of God. It's not easy to enter into a world where extremely fine points of religious doctrine excite such passion and controversy but LaPlante wisely uses the trial transcripts to let Anne's own words convey the passion. This was life and death, not of the body but of the soul to Anne.LaPlante also does an admirable job of placing Anne's boldness in context. She was an educated, forward-thinking woman in an age when women were allowed no public voice. The mere idea of Anne \\"preaching\\" was heretical, let alone her content. I thought LaPlante avoided over-reaching the case, however, as she doesn't claim that Anne was the \\"first feminist\\" or other slightly silly claims. She keeps Anne's acts in their time and they are all the more compelling for this.The book has two narrative strains, the first is the trial and the second (woven around the first) is the chronological story of Anne's life. This can make for a disjointed feel but I adapted to the flow by chapter 4. The are no photos in this book but the maps included are fascinating. For those interested in early American history, religious history and just who \\"The Hutch\\" is named after this is fine popular history."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"The genealogy given in the appendix of this book shows the author thirteen generations directly removed from the book's subject, Anne Marbury Hutchinson. Anne's descendants are also said to include Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George Walker Bush. Other books about Hutchinson have been written, but this one is probably the most thoroughly researched.Eve LaPlante says she is a journalist; it appears that she has published a couple dozen freelance pieces as well as three other books. She also says that this is a non-fiction book. Although there is quite an extensive bibliography, there are no citations within the text, and one wonders how she knows so precisely that the sky was clear at sunrise on November 8, 1637 (p. 70), to pick an instance of literary embellishment at random.One expects a journalist to understand the difference between an institutional view and something said by a member of that institution. Thus, on page xxi, she says, \\"According to Harvard University, it is she rather than John Harvard who 'should be credited with the founding of Harvard College.'\\" She puts things better into context on pages 133f. Harvard Professor Peter Gomes calls Hutchinson the \\"midwife\\" to the College, and explains why this is appropriate. (In addition to this unintended and symbolic role, Hutchinson was a midwife in her \\"normal\\" life.) Prof. Gomes teaches the history of Harvard and is probably more qualified than any other to offer such an opinion, but to say that \\"Harvard University\\" holds this view (indeed, any view) is no more accurate than to say that the New York Times does simply because Ms. LaPlante has published there. And while both Anne Hutchinson, indirectly, and John Harvard, more directly, played important roles in the establishment of the College between 1636 and 1638, the politics are far too complicated to ascribe the title \\"founder\\" to any one person.The book is somewhat uneven; the story of Anne's trials is quite drawn out and interspersed with many flashbacks, while the commentary once she has died seems to be as rapid a recitation of whatever notes and thoughts were left over as can be stitched together. It is evident where the author's heart is.Because of these mechanical issues, I cannot give the book a full five stars. As a period piece on Massachusetts in the 1630s, it leaves a bit to be desired. But as source material on her subject with enough documentation to be able to read between the lines why she believes what she writes, it is unlikely that any other author will have the same passion for the subject, the wherewithal to carry out the research, and (mostly) the ability to pull off a moving story."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"Eve Laplante's American Jezebel is an engaging exposition of one of America's most notable forgotten women, Anne Hutchinson. Creating vivid scenes of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Rhode Island, the Dutch occupied New Amsterdam (later to become New York), and through historical flashbacks, Laplante manages to draw the reader into the, at times, laborious and uneven narrative structure of the Hutchinson trial. It quickly becomes evident that the real issue for then Governor John Winthrop is not the doctrine of a female heretic, but power. Winthrop, desiring a community built on 17th Century Puritan gender role order, saw Hutchinson as a threat to maintaining community stability. From the very beginning, Winthrop's goal was, not to dialogue with Hutchinson over doctrine, but to expel her from Boston.Although falsely labeled an antinomian, Hutchinson never displayed any immoral behavior in the community. Her sincere belief focused around an individual relationship with Christ and the inspiration of the indwelling Holy Spirit, doctrines she learned from her father Francis Marbury and her pastor and mentor, John Cotton, who, during the trial, threw his pupil under the bus. The charges were dubious and what the trial transcripts reveal is the cultural attitude toward an extremely bold and bright female the leading male authorities wanted suppressed. However, Anne did contribute to the court's contempt for her with an arrogant and judgmental diatribe at the end of her first hearing. Humility was not one of Hutchinson's virtues and the absence of it cost her and her family through community expulsion.While her contribution to women's rights--equality and intellectual freedom--were admirable her Christian orthodoxy was questionable, but the necessity to dialogue over these issues was denied her and that remains the sad legacy of Governor Winthrop and the Massachusetts Bay Colony."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"Eve LaPlante's life of her infamous ancestor is a labor of love. It is chock-a-block with details about Hutchinson's descendants and about the current state of various places she visited that most likely will be of interest only to ... Hutchinson's descendants. Yet, it is more than that: it is a sympathetic account of perhaps the most eminent person to be thrown out of Puritan Massachusetts.The issue over which Hutchinson ultimately suffered the fate of Roger Williams and, later, the Massachusetts Quakers was that of the sufficiency of the Scriptures to Protestant life. According to Hutchinson, she had received her un-Puritan ideas directly from God. This contradicted one of the two basic Protestant principles, _Sola Scriptura_ -- that the only authority a Protestant need recognize is that of the Scriptures, which supposedly spoke clearly and for themselves.LaPlante is angry with the Puritan authorities, but what else could they have done than what they did? As in Williams' case, it is not as if Governor John Winthrop's opponent gave him a lot of choice. The alternative to banishing Hutchinson would have been to see her unshakable self-righteousness continue to fracture the Bay State. This meant the failure of the New England experiment. In individual cases, as the Puritan authorities understood it, it meant that particular people persuaded to adopt Hutchinson's way of seeing things would be condemned to eternity in Hell.Contrary to the Publishers Weekly review above, the Puritans certainly DID NOT teach that the covenant of works was the only guarantee of salvation. What they held was essentially that faith without works is dead (gee, I wonder where they got that idea). LaPlante recognizes the difficulty posed by Hutchinson's position: that it would mean that there was no real indication in this life whether the individual believer was \\"saved,\\" to borrow a contemporary term.LaPlante joins Karlsen in insisting that her subject's fate would have been different if only she had been a male. Yet, with Williams in mind, she should have known better than that. Irresistible though this trendy idea may be, one doubts that the several men expelled as part of the anti-Hutchinson purge would have found it very persuasive.Hutchinson had her revenge, of course: her descendants included a governor of Massachusetts, two governors of Rhode Island, and three presidents of the United States (at least one of whom seems as blissfully, fanatically self-righteous as his forebear), and she has been declared to be in good odor in recent decades by the government of Massachusetts itself.If feeling less charitable, however, one might note that Hutchinson's devotion to an incomprehensible, insupportable, and indeed ultimately nonsensical theological position does not make her a very sympathetic figure. Her hard-headed certainty that she knew the mind of God led to the brutal murder not only of Hutchinson herself, but of several of her children. Winthrop's response to the news of that event was very ugly, but he was right to hold that her odd views accounted for her end."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"Author LaPlante harps on, at length, about her Anne Hutchinson DNA. She even feels compelled to grace this book with a Family Tree Centerfold. I couldn't care less who she is or was related to. Smarmier yet are feel-good passages about how she bonded with her kids during a Minivan \\"Roots\\" Tour to connect with their reviled and heroic forebear. I guess this counts as \\"research\\", and the IRS likely considers the expenses deductible. But such claptrap gives the impression, false, I trust, that someone's been Channeling Past Lives, or Casting Runes, or prowling ancestral graveyards with a Divining Rod.A page-turner this is not. The pace and style are labored, and it takes the author a while before she plunges into the intricacies of Reformation Protestant Theology. But once she gets there, the reader should prepare for a tour-de-force. And it goes on. And on. Hard to believe people once spent substantial portions of their (short) lives (endlessly) debating this stuff. Then again, as the author makes clear, there wasn't much else to do.\\"Jezebel\\" racks up a few points as a reminder that the Puritans were unforgiving hypocrites who suffered from delusions of grandeur. They were also greedy, murderous, land-grabbing, sadists. The author writes that the King of England initially forbid them to emigrate. Why? These folks, especially Mrs. Hutchinson and her friends, would seem eminently qualified for rush-job exit visas. Another reviewer mentions that the original American Jezebel comes off as a trifle loopy. Maybe even tetched. After a dozen pregnancies, some vintage transatlantic commuting, a plague epidemic or two, and a childhood of fire-and-brimstone rants, this is understandable."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"It is marvelous to read details about the nation's first feminist,Anne Hutchinson, a woman who ought to make more appearances in classrooms. LaPlante's writing keeps the story moving, although it was disconcerting at the beginning of the book to have her give 1637 as the date when Harvard was founded. The year was 1636, which may change her reference to Hutchinson in that connection. That's minor, however, compared to bringing to life a woman who stood up to the austere and determined men of Boston, founded a place in Rhode Island and then had her life ironically ended in a massacre by Indians when she had been a champion of at least some Native American rights. Few Americans who travel the Hutchinson River Parkway on a daily basis probably know where its name came from, but perhaps LaPlante's book will widen that awareness. Like Abigail Adams, Hutchinson was a powerful woman at a time when women were not supposed to have any power. This book is particularly interesting to me because, like LaPlante, I'm a Hutchinson descendant."},{"Title":"American Jezebel : The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans","review":"This book follows the story of a woman who opposed the puritanical laws of the early Americans.

Klinger's 487 Indisputable Truths (for people who are not un-American weasels, hypersensitive PC types, or humorless bores). Klinger wastes no time in getting to the point, presenting 487 straightforward, no-nonsense Truths that don't mince words.Klinger-a man of obvious convictions-has the fortitude to jump right in and call it like it is about God, families, politics, and all that makes this country great. I love the way he celebrates this great country in Truth number one, \\"The United States is the greatest country ever conceived,\\" and keeps it coming in the following Truth with, \\"The United States would be even better if more people believed in God, respected their elders, and generally voted Republican.\\" Very true.Klinger opines on a bunch of other topics, too, that make for some interesting, and sometimes very funny, reading. Truth number 432, \\"No matter where you live, you will always have at least one weird neighbor,\\" sure is accurate and number 112, \\"A comb-over haircut will not fool anyone into thinking you're not bald,\\" cracks me up.But be forewarned: Truths doesn't pull any punches. So, if you are described in the subtitle, it's simply not for you. A good example of the no-holds-barred approach is Truth number 218, \\"Members of NARAL Pro-Choice America (or whatever its name is today) and the National Organization for Women could save themselves a lot of time by not whining about their abortion rights-nobody wants to have sex with any of them anyway.\\" Hello!And don't get me wrong about the book's inherent simplicity: While it would be easy to dismiss Truths as overly simple, the careful reader will see that the book challenges one to think more deeply. A good example is Truth number 130, which reads, \\"You cannot be a fighter pilot and get through Yale undergrad and Harvard Business School and be a dummy.\\" Klinger never once mentions a name, but the astute reader will figure out it's a clear reference (and tribute of sorts) to President Bush.Ultimately, although you could read Truths cover-to-cover in under an hour, it's not the kind of book you read and then stick on the bookshelf to collect dust.

In 1964, Bantam began their series of paperbacks, which ran for 26 years. As time allows, I will give brief descriptions/reviews of the entire series. In Brand of the Werewolf, #5 in the Bantam Series, Doc and his five assistants go on vacation to the western shores of Canada, where Doc's Uncle Alex owns a huge wildlife refuge. The Uncle has been murdered before the book begins, killed by a mysterious sleep which mirrors a sudden heart attack. These sleeping episodes continue, each one accompanied by a smudge of the face of a werewolf left at the scene. The mystery involves an ivory cube containing a map inside which shows the location of a shipwreaked galleon filled with lost treasure. The Doc Savage books are not politically correct, and in this one, the insulted race is the Spanish, those \\"swarthy-looking fellows.\\" This is also the book that introduces Doc's beautiful bronze cousin, Pat, daughter of the late Alex. She becomes one of Doc's assistants in a number of future adventures. The writing is true pulp fiction: fast, simple, direct with an occasional memorable line such as: \\"A fat, milky bag of a moon leaked its beams.\\""},{"Title":"Brand of the Werewolf (5)","review":"A telegram faked to appear as if it was from Doc Savage, multiple murders, including the telegraph operator, and a couple of fellow passengers from Spain.This leads Doc travelling with his gang to see the relatives, to discover what the whole Brand of the Werewolf seen on the train is about.His cousin Patricia has been attacked, betrayed by a servant.

All three credit Leo Margulies as the editor. But according to _The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_ (1995), Sam Moskowitz ghost edited the last two. This seems likely. The first book consists of more modern-- and generally better-- stories. The latter two books are more old-fashioned and more uneven in quality. But perhaps they give the reader a better flavor of the magazine during its golden years._Worlds of Weird_ (1965) consists of seven stories published in the thirties-- the golden era of the magazine, when the eccentric but able Farnsworth Wright was at the editorial helm. The stories are: Seabury Quinn's \\"Roads,\\" Nictzin Dyalhis's \\"The Saphire Goddess,\\" Robert E. Howard's \\"Valley of the Worm,\\" Edmond Hamilton's \\"He That Hath Wings,\\" Clark Ashton Smith's \\"Mother of Toads,\\" David H. Keller's \\"The Thing in the Celler,\\" and Frank Belknap Long's \\"Giants in the Sky\\". Four of the authors-- Dyalhis, Howard, Hamilton, and Long-- were represented in the earlier _Weird Tales_ (1964). In general, the stories in this anthology appear to be a cut above those in the earlier volumn.The entry by Dyalhis is a parallel worlds sword and sorcery adventure that is not quite as good as \\"The Sea Witch,\\" but it is still great fun. The Howard is a historical sword and sorcery that is a marked improvement over his dreadful \\"Pigeons From Hell\\". The Long is one of the \\"soft\\" science fictional pieces that the Unique Magazine published from time to time. It is, like most of Long's stories, fairly routine. But the Hamilton is something else again. It is the allegory about the boy born with wings, his freedom, and his tragic fate. It is a beautifully told tale-- one of the author's best.The Seabury Quinn story was billed as a kind of Christmas story when it first appeared. I will say no more about the plot lest I spoil the \\"surprise\\" ending that is telegraphed from the beginning. I would have preferred one of the author's Jules de Grandin stories that is longer in entertainment value and shorter on piety.There remain two horror stories. The Smith is an appropriately unpleasant tale featuring a French batrachian witch. It is moderately effective. The Keller is a psychological chiller that never brings its horror directly onstage. But it closes with a desperate line of denial and rationalization that hit me where I live.An added bonus is a cover and some dandy interior illustrations by Virgil Finlay and a historical introduction about the early years of _WT_ by Moskowitz. Do you want to know the story about how H.P. Lovecraft was once offered the editorship of the magazine? Or how it came about that he ghosted Harry Houdini's \\"Imprisoned with the Pharoahs\\"? Or what the relationship was between _Weird Tales_ and _Home Brew_, America's Zippiest Magazine? Then buy this book and read the introduction."},{"Title":"Worlds of Weird","review":"Released in May 1964, the slim paperback entitled \\"Weird Tales,\\" edited by Leo Margulies, drew together eight previously uncollected stories from the legendary pulp magazine. It was apparently a successful venture, as just eight months later, its follow-up companion, \\"Worlds of Weird,\\" was released, another slim paperback that is at least as great as the first. In this volume, Margulies again selects the stories--seven of them, this time--while pulp fiction authority Sam Moskowitz gives us a trenchant general introduction, as well as an intro to each tale. And, oh...for those of you who may have been under the catatonic spell of a centuries-old witch for the past 90 years, \\"Weird Tales\\" magazine specialized in horror, fantasy and strange sci-fi material, and over the course of its 32-year run, from 1923-'54, attracted a small but intensely loyal following of both readers and contributors. Its 279 issues introduced readers to dozens of now-famous authors who comprise a veritable Who's Who of some of the finest genre writers of the 20th century. The seven authors in this second collection (four of whom appeared in the first) are all closely associated with the magazine, and so I suppose this volume can serve as a nice introduction to those new to the \\"Weird Tales\\" universe. All seven entries are wonderful, and three of them are recognized masterpieces of the short-story form.As for the stories themselves: The collection kicks off tremendously with a tale that was deemed a masterpiece soon after appearing in the 1/38 issue of \\"Weird Tales,\\" and it is Seabury Quinn's \\"Roads.\\" Quinn, of course, was the magazine's most frequently published contributor, with a whopping 145 stories, most of which dealt with the occult detective Jules de Grandin. \\"Roads,\\" however, is not a de Grandin tale, but something more on the order of a \\"superhero origin story.\\" Without giving away too much, let's just say that Moskowitz, in his intro, says that it may well be \\"the greatest adult Christmas story written by an American,\\" and that it tells of a blond-bearded gladiator named Klaus, who has several encounters with a certain well-known Jewish preacher and crucifixion victim over a 30-year period. This story is beautifully written and displays an inordinate amount of historical research on Quinn's part. (Still, Quinn is guilty of several anachronisms here, such as when he mentions Vikings in the year A.D. 30, and the fact that Klaus, after the year A.D. 30, fought Arminius in the Teutoburg Forest, a battle that actually transpired in A.D. 9.) An historical fable that segues into outright fantasy, it is ultimately quite moving and really a bravura performance by its author. No wonder August Derleth gave it the hardcover Arkham House treatment 10 years later, and that it was chosen for inclusion in Cawthorn & Moorcock's \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\\" Anyway, next up in this \\"Weird Tales\\" assortment is a hard-core fantasy from an author who had previously never let me down, Nictzin Dyalhis (yes, that IS his real name). His story here, however, \\"The Sapphire Goddess\\" (from the 2/34 issue)--in which a man is whisked to another dimension, only to realize that he is an amnesia-stricken king caught in a battle between dueling wizards--is a bit too sketchily drawn and fast moving for my tastes; this tale could easily have been expanded to book length for greater effect. Still, fun enough. Up next is another offering from the famous creator of Conan, King Kull and Solomon Kane: Robert E. Howard. \\"The Valley of the Worm\\" (also from the 2/34 issue) tells the story of how Niord--an \\"Aesirian\\" at the dawn of Earth's history--teamed up with a former enemy, Grom the Pict, to slay the fearsome monster of the title. Exciting as can be, and narrated by one of Niord's future incarnations, the story features no less than three awe-inspiring monsters, one of which is a tentacled horror that H.P. Lovecraft himself might have looked on with approbation. To my mind, a masterpiece from Robert E. Howard, and my favorite story in this volume.The collection offers yet another masterpiece immediately after, Edmond \\"The World Wrecker\\" Hamilton's oft-anthologized \\"He That Hath Wings\\" (7/38). This lovely story, of a child born with wings who later attains the gift of flight, and who must make some tough choices after falling in love with a woman who deems him a \\"freak,\\" is surely one of its author's finest shorter works, both touching and unforgettable. Clark Ashton Smith, one of the magazine's most gifted stylists, is here represented with his tale \\"Mother of Toads\\" (again, from the 7/38 issue). This creepy, unpleasant story, which takes place in the France of what might be today or 300 years ago, shows us how dangerous it can be to reject the amorous advances of a witch; the tale's swampy finale should surely satisfy all fans of the macabre. David H. Keller, M.D., a psychiatrist turned sci-fi and horror author, is here shown to good effect with his short tale \\"The Thing in the Cellar\\" (3/32), in which 6-year-old Tommy Tucker exhibits an overriding, irrational fear of something in the Tucker house's basement. But IS Tommy's fear so irrational, after all? This story concludes on a surprisingly bleak note, but one that should again greatly please all horror buffs. And the collection is brought to a close with a piece of hard science fiction from Frank Belknap Long, \\"Giants in the Sky\\" (8/39), in which a race of beings from the planet Icurus, each being \\"thousands of miles tall\\" (!), bags our entire solar system for study under the microscopes of their world. Ultimately rather affecting, with the power of love both uniting two Earthlings while laying low one of the Icurians, the story is somewhat clunkily written but yet manages to impress. Anyway, there you have it...yet another winning batch of stories from \\"The Unique Magazine.\\" All fans of Golden Age horror, fantasy and sci-fi should most certainly pounce on these \\"Worlds of Weird\\"!"},{"Title":"Observational Research Handbook: Understanding How Consumers Live with Your Product","review":"A bit repetitive at times, perhaps because the author didn't have permission to discuss a lot of different client projects. I came away thinking that observational research (which includes interactions with consumers - not just watching them) is a sophisticated research and planning activity that only the most advanced corporations (e.g., General Mills, Xerox, Hallmark, P&amp;G, Toyota) understand and hire for (or maybe they use their own in-house experts, something that Abrams discourages). I would also expect that it takes a lot of training and experience for someone to do this without unintentionally influencing the study - although Abrams reinforces the point that this is subjective and qualitative - and that is part of it's value. Sure seems like if a observational researcher can do this well, they could discover things that could change an entire industry (like the Palm Pilot or the Chrysler Mini-Van). Overall, I found the book to be &quot;okay,&quot; the method itself - potentially ground-breaking."},{"Title":"King of Kielder (Mills & Boon, #1860)","review":"My Gran sadly died a few years ago but her books as still selling and long may that continue. this is a great book typically her.Thanks"},{"Title":"The Evaluation of Osteoporosis","review":"We tend to forget how these machines work, and how easily they can be fooled to deliver inaccurate results.

Lots of examples of poor scans, many of which I still see today on a daily basis in the field, yet go unrecognized by techs and physicians alike."},{"Title":"Gossip Girl Boxed Set","review":"The Upper East Side used to be overrun with plastic surgery happy society women, and spoiled tots torturing their high-priced nannies. But times have changed. While these people still occupy a small portion of the sidewalks, they have been pushed aside for a new generation of beautiful people. Teenagers brought up in the lap of luxury, who spend their days buying overpriced La Perla undergarments at Barney's, and indulging in frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. But spending money isn't all that's on their mind. There's always...gossip.GOSSIP GIRL: Ever since the flawless Serena van der Woodsen departed from New York City to take up residence at a boarding school in Connecticut, sixteen-year-old Blair Waldorf has ruled Constance Billard School for Girls. As the daughter of a prominent lawyer turned gay, Blair has always gotten her way. And, with Serena out of the picture, was able to snag the gorgeous, green-eyed Nate Archibald for herself. Unfortunately, as much as Blair would like to deny it, Nate has always had a thing for Serena. A secret passion for the blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty. And now with Serena back in the picture, Blair doesn't know where their relationship will stand. So she has to take drastic measures...hand Nate her V card and he'll be hers forever. The only problem is that Nate is a stoner who has a very short attention span, and even sacrificing herself to Nate won't let him forget the passion he feels for Serena.But he's not the only one. Dan Humphrey isn't your typical rich kid. For one, while he attends school with some of New York City's most privileged, he actually resides in an apartment on the Upper West Side with his chesty younger sister, Jenny, and his eccentric writer father, Rufus. Dan is a dark, brooding poet, whose penchant for cigarettes and Folgers coffee crystals leave much to be desired. But, like Nate, Dan is infatuated with Serena. The only difference is that he has never so much as spoken to her before, and she doesn't know he exists. Now that Serena's off the A-List, and treading outcast waters, however, the only thing he can hope is that she'll find her way to him and they can live happily ever after. In his dreams, of course. 5 stars.YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME: Everyone is in the midst of applying to Ivy League Colleges, but Blair Waldorf is planning a little something extra...her seventeenth birthday. Unfortunately, her mother has sprung a big announcement - she's getting married to Cyrus Rose, and the wedding will take place on Blair's birthday. So much for special days. Then there's Serena, who is being constantly pursued by Dan, a disturbed poet with intense affections. Sure, Serena is used to being pursued by guys of all ages, but Dan is slightly creepy with his morbid poetry. Of course, Serena is a girl, and what girl doesn't love having poems being written about her.Although these teens are rich, obviously money can't buy you everything. At least it can't buy Blair Waldorf everything. For Blair's seventeenth birthday bash is coming up, and she knows that the only thing that she can possibly wish for is Nate Archibald, her troubled, yet gorgeous, boyfriend, of course. But little does she know that while she's sending out college applications, Nate is fooling around with Jenny Humphrey, a ninth-grader! Looks like Blair's birthday is destined to be a blowout of epic proportions. 5 stars.ALL I WANT IS EVERYTHING:Blair Waldorf is having the worst time of her life. She has just completely flubbed her Yale interview, even going so far as to kiss her interviewer; she must contend with a dreadlock-bearing new stepbrother named Aaron, who seems to have some ulterior motives up his sleeve; her mother is marrying a loser whom she has known for hardly no time at all; and, to top it all off, Nate has ditched her for a chesty ten-year-old - well, she looks ten. Luckily, she and Serena van der Woodsen are back on speaking terms, and living it up as BFF's once more. But who knows how long that will last.The holidays are just around the corner, and with the Upper East Side absolutely freezing, everyone who's loaded is planning on ditching their Marc Jacobs coats, and slipping into their Missoni string bikinis for a Christmas in a tropical place. With Nate Archibald having called it quits with Blair in order to take up a romance with freshman Jenny Humphrey, Blair is anything but ready to say goodbye to the city, and head off to St. Bart's with Serena, where they can sunbathe topless, and, perhaps, have a winter fling. Unfortunately, Serena is being stalked by Flow, the hottest rock star on the planet - at least at the moment - and can't seem to shake him off, and Blair, armed with her iBook plans on holing up in the hotel room writing the essay for her Yale application. Looks like this vacation won't be as sizzling as originally planned. But with Blair's new stepbrother, Aaron, and his pal Miles in tow, you never know when the sparks will fly.Back in the city, Nate and Jenny are having the time of their life. But with Blair's sudden appearances at every turn, Nate finds himself more and more drawn to the girl he has known and loved for so many years. But then there's Jenny. Sweet, innocent, voluptuous Jenny. Maybe if Nate spent less time being baked, and more time being straight, he'd be able to decide who he's truly lusting over.Then there's Jenny's older brother, Dan. Since admitting their passion for one another, Dan and Vanessa have been having a whirlwind romance - albeit a dark one - filled with foreign films, cigarettes, strong instant coffee, and lots and lots of black. But since falling in love, Dan finds himself at a standstill regarding his poetry. Suddenly, he's experiencing writer's block firsthand, and it's not a pretty picture. But when Vanessa supposedly does something that betrays both him and Jenny, he wonders if this is the push he needs to get his writing back on track - and to get even. 5 stars.Let's put it bluntly, Cecily von Ziegesar is a genius. She has taken the simple subject of rich, spoiled, troublemaking teens, and managed to produce a series that is both irresistible and infuriating. Each of the characters bring a sense of upper class to the table, along with a bit of scandal, and, dare I say it, trashiness. They have created a virtual playground of the Upper East Side, and dominate every hotel, club, or bar from Manhattan to Williamsburg. But they're oh so delicious. Serena is carefree and easygoing, however, she possesses a selfless and tragic air that makes her irresistible. Blair, on the other hand, is stuck-up and pretentious, but she knows how to let her hair down. Unfortunately, she usually lets her hair down at approximately the same time that her claws come out. Nate is a bad boy in good boy's clothing. His gorgeous looks make up for the fact that he has little between the ears due to how much of his time he spends high. Jenny and her older brother, Dan, on the other hand, are artistes who add a sweet touch to the series; and Vanessa manages to turn heads by brandishing her bald one. Each character converges together to weave an amazing story that leaves you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. A delicious series that will definitely give you something to talk about!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Gossip Girl Boxed Set","review":"These books will take you to another world (or perhaps your world if you're extremely lucky!). These books tell a hilarious and fun account of growing up in the wealthiest part of the upper-east side of New York, New York. Blair Woldorf, the main character, is a controling imaginative, and ambitious girl from a family of old money. Watch her deal with her perfect &quot;best friend,&quot; boys, the college admitions process, and her complex family life. While she is the main character you also get a glimpse of this lifestyle from other various points of view. You see it from the eyes of Nate (a burned out heart-throb), Serena (a carefree beauty), Dan (a poetic romanitc), Vanessa (a talented, esoteric artist), Jenny (the young inocent one), and Aaron (a stranger tossed into this scene by an odd marrage). You will not be able to put these books down and each one will leave you begging for more! Read these books immidiately, and you won't be sorry!!"},{"Title":"Gossip Girl Boxed Set","review":"This is really superficial stuff, but it's no wonder it's such a hit. These rich kids' designer lives are the stuff we've all fantasized about. It's just as easy to relish the high moments (Serena hooks up with a rock star, Dan and Vanessa finally get it on) as it is the disasters (Blair dates her Yale interviewer, only to find out he's the married father of one of her classmates, Nate gets busted trying to buy pot in Central Park).The [...] interludes are the perfect device, because they remind readers of our place in the whole mess: We are not these characters. We are not their friends. We are simply gawkers.While none of the characters are particularly noble, it's fun watching them throw fabulous benefits (complete with Kate Spade gift bags!) or jet off to a tropical island for the holidays. The author expertly weaves their various storylines together for maximum energy. But do your kids really have to read the whole series? Probably just one or two will do. They're really fairly similar, except for the fabulous outfits, of course."},{"Title":"Gossip Girl Boxed Set","review":"I'm da 1st reviewer. This set contains the 1st three books in the series.

I read all five of the books in about 8 or 9 days ... they were that good!! Although the characters in the Gossip Girl series are mind-blowingly rich, it seems that they deal with the same problems as average teens, such as drugs, back-stabbing friends, and break-ups. When you think about it, that's really the messege of these books: that we're not all as different as we think we are. Also, Cecily von Ziegesar is such a convincing writer, sometimes I feel like I know Blair, Serena, Nate, and the rest of the gang, instead of them just being fictional characters!

Academics are totally missing, the emphasis is on relationships, what they mean and where sex comes in.The emphasis is on two girls, with supporting characters, and the boys they all seem to get involved with. The emphasis seems to be on having sex, not on what it means. Not only is sex prevalent but the books also have the boys using drugs, both boys and girls drinking, their age is only seventeen primarily but there is a fourteen year old also involved. These spoiled teenagers seem to feel laws do not apply to them, if they want to do something, just do it. I read nothing about the use of contraceptives but no one got pregnant, only the parents. I have overused the word \\"emphasis\\" but that is what the book does, emphasizes behavior, attitudes, money and location. Not everyone lives on New York's East side, not all even live within shouting distance of Central Park, but those that do are the leaders and set the example for all those in their group. These books are raw and non=judgmental, they are not fit to be read by an immature audience unless under adult supervision with commentary on the content. The race for college entrance, and Ivy League schools, is also addressed."},{"Title":"Gossip Girl Boxed Set","review":"These honestly are great books.

The drama doesnt take long to start either. Dont expect the characters to be anything like the show. They are totally different in this series. The series follows a standard feel from book to book. You read a few chapters which consist of drama and a build up to the ending of the book and then we get a chapter that looks like a website. Here is the chapter where gossip girl posts all her latest gossip. Its different and fun at the same time. This series is pretty solid so far.

They're fun, and I find most teenage girls can relate to the bouncy, glamourous and impossibly rich characters' feelings. However, girls should recognize that many of the issues talked about in this book- sex, eating disorders, academics- are much more serious than these books make them sound. When reading these books, be sure to keep in mind that this is far from reality- only a fun escape from some of the more mundane activities in real life.

I kept reading the books up until about half way into the third one. I never liked the books though because I wanted to know how things would end up, I kept reading. The book is unrealistic and does set a good example to teen girls If I (as a teen age girl) decided to follow the lead of the charecters. Then I would be smoking, drunk, partying too much and ok with having a boyfriend who does pot. That was a combenation of a few charecters though I think it gets the point across.

The author reminds us that, despite the material advances of modern society, some key economic ideas still apply. All societies must be organized for the material survival of its members. The inter-dependencies among societal members in simpler societies have not been eliminated in market societies, despite the hyping of the independent, self-maximizer by modern theorists; in fact, the complexities of modern societies may well create more dependence, not less. And market societies do have some inherent problems.The author points out that any society must have a coherent system for producing useful goods and services and then distributing them in a manner sufficient for society's perpetuation. Man has relied upon combinations of tradition, command, and markets to solve those production and distribution problems. Tradition uses time-honored methods of work, \\"allocated by heredity,\\" which are reinforced by \\"law, custom, and belief.\\" Change and competitiveness are not tolerated. Command is authoritarian control of economies and is mostly associated with economies operating in rapid catch-up mode, such as the Soviet Union. However, even democracies use elements of command during periods of crisis. In market societies, the aggregation of supply and demand guide economic functioning with no distinct center of control or allegiance to past practices.Manorial estates and the guilds dominated life in the Middle Ages along with the Church, but the author points to small beginnings of a more commercial world. Itinerant merchants established a small niche for commercial activity in some urban areas. The more successful of them came to be key financiers of monarchs keen on expanding their authority. The gold and silver realized from 16th century New World expeditions stimulated commercial activity. Calvinism, in contrast to the Catholic Church, sanctified hard work and the accumulation of wealth as an indicator of spiritual worthiness. Gradually, feudal society became more reliant upon money as a basis of social exchange. No longer were manorial lords obligated for the overall well being of serfs. The displacement of peasants by the enclosure movements was justified by the opportunities for the landed aristocracy to use their estates as sources of cash revenue.The author identifies several changes that are necessary for a market economy to emerge. Virtually every task, good, or service has a monetary reward. The anticipation of financial reward guides such decisions as where to labor or what to produce. A society of contracts supercedes a society of status and traditional social bonds. With those changes, a certain amount of social uncertainty is introduced. Yet a market society is not without its own forms of control. The competitions of seller versus seller and buyer versus seller are constraining forces on economic behavior.Generally it takes a market economy to substantially change the material well being of an entire society. In the first place, traditional societies are not unhappy with the status quo. What is needed are investments in capital goods, or \\"tools, equipment, machines, and buildings,\\" to increase human productivity leading to higher living standards. And it is the hope for profits or higher wages that spurs investment of money and labor in those goods. But investment implies savings, which, in turn, generally requires a sacrifice in consumption and lower wages. The author suggests that the growing pains of industrialization, mostly on the backs of the working class with the \\"forced emigration of the peasantry by enclosure and heavy-handed exploitation,\\" could not have been avoided. He undercuts that argument slightly by acknowledging that the forces of democracy in the 19th century ameliorated conditions for the working class.Scientific and technological advances are often large factors in the development of capital goods and increased productivity. English industrial production literally exploded based on the inventions of such men as Wilkinson, Watt, and Arkwright. The factory system came to dominate English life. New technologies have often literally transformed market societies. The automobile, for example, drastically changed residential patterns, facilitated social independence, and was a massive generator of employment. Can anyone doubt the impacts of electricity, airplanes, television, and computers?However, the author points out that market societies do not necessarily operate according to the basic theory. \\"Consumer power\\" is a first principle of classical economists; according to that notion, consumers force products to be sold \\"at the lowest price compatible with continued production.\\" But market societies invariably tend to be dominated by a few large firms, where economic efficiencies can be attained. These large enterprises often agree among themselves to set pricing above truly competitive levels. In addition, because much of what is produced in modern economies is non essential, consistency of demand must be created through advertising. While large firms may be needed, consumer sovereignty is mostly a fiction.Stable market economies must maintain the balances between production and purchasing and savings and investment. Workers' purchasing power must be consistent with production volumes. In addition, savings ought to be converted into investment, or capital formation. The Great Depression was brought about by workers being underpaid and capital investments not being made. The Great Depression and WWII established that government must intervene in a market economy through fiscal and monetary policies to bolster economic stability.The author emphasizes that basic instabilities remain in market societies. In a market economy, it remains the anticipation of profit on the part of businesses and entrepreneurs that motivates most investment and growth. Technological displacement and unemployment continue to undermine purchasing power. And the author wrote in an era before the evisceration of large \\"countervailing\\" unions, the forces of globalization, and a resurgence of rightist, anti-government ideologies. Those developments could have only added to the author's concerns of instabilities.The book is hurt by not being able to contend with the tremendous changes of the last forty years, though the cautions remain relevant today. It is, however, an excellent guide for understanding the economic and societal changes from the Middle Ages to the era of science and capitalism. Try Charles Lindblom's \\"The Market System.\\""},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Economic History for undergraduate students. It is concise and well-written, full of poignant examples, tracing economic organization from the Middle Ages through the present. The chapter summaries and discussion questions at the end of each chapter are very useful for both the student and the professor. The brevity of the book leaves open the possibility of including related academic articles or even other textbooks in the syllabus.The main disappointment is that the nineteenth century--which was full of economic, social, and political change--is basically ignored. The content jumps from the Industrial Revolution to the beginning of the twentieth century. The traditional Euro-American egocentrism is also present."},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"I'd enjoyed Heilbroner's \\"Worldly Philosophers\\" so much that I purchased this title thinking it would be its equal, but sadly that was not the case.

Intended for introductory economics students, it could also be enjoyed by the casual or curious reader who wanted to review basic economic history and theory.Analytical Review: Heilbroner's style is very accessible. This is a readable book. You don't have to be an economist find something interesting in it. I found Heilbroner to take a fairly balanced view of the merits of capitalism and Adam Smith (which he clearly favors), but also an appreciative view of the Marxist spirit of equality. Heilbroner's book is concise without sacrificing thought-provoking questions and content."},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"The book provided a fairly decent foundation for the concepts it presents, though I feel as though it does so in an overly wordy and diffuse manner. The authors frequently make sweeping statements about a general topic with little to no evidence; indeed, little to no evidence even exists for some of the generalizations made. Similarly, the authors frequently pose what appears to be a significant question at the beginning of a section and then do little to answer it, instead jumping from topic to topic as if to say \\"look how much stuff we know!\\" I know I have a bias in coming from the physical sciences, but I believe students and instructors can find a clearer and more concise overview of the material in another book."},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"I've read several of Robert Heilbroner's books and this one had some real pearls of wisdom. It starts slow going all the way back to the 1400's but he gets into some great economic theory towards the late 1800's. His perspective of the \\"robber barons\\" was interesting. The last chapter is a gem in his analysis of why capitalism works but not too well in the US. In summary, this book (written a long time ago in the early 60's) is a great compliment to a Thomas Sowell."},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"the book is a uninteresting read for those who dont study this subject but it is also a good beginners book for those who will study the subject..."},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"This is a concise text book for use in high school or first-year college classes on the history of economics that traces the development of the market economy. The basic framework of the book is valuable: how the market transcended earlier forms of economic organization based on command and/or tradition.There are good summaries of key terms and good discussion questions at the end of each chapter to stimulate classroom discussion; organizationally the book is very good and production values are quite high - very few typesetting errors, good paper, nice ink.Robert Heilbroner is not, however, the best equipped author to be writing on this subject, as his cynical, Hobbesian view of human nature comes to the surface in numerous remarks whose cumulative effect is a high degree of skepticism about free enterprise and unregulated markets - a skepticism that is not backed by evidence and argument, but more by fears of &quot;bigness&quot; and &quot;unscrupulousness&quot; of business and businesspeople.(Review based on the Tenth edition of this book)"},{"Title":"The Making of Economic Society","review":"This book was a perfect price!

Men and women can learn a lot from how she concentrates and enjoys each situation for the moment. When reality jumps up at one point and responsibility hits her, the drama is intense.I've read almost every celebrity biography there is and Ms. Leigh's is one of the best. It is a must read for women who want to know how to handle a career and love relationships as well as for men who want to know how to attract and hold a beautiful and exciting woman. Ms. Leigh mentions that even Elvis got into familiar and perdictable routines that weren't as exciting as other opportunitys.

In it, she details her romantic involvements during the wild, crazy and turbulent 1970's, her busy career as an actress and model, her disappointments with show business, and her association with three of the most powerful men in the entertainment industry at that time. Barbara is a beautiful, sexy woman who clearly loves men, and she makes no apologies for it. Why should she? You go, Girl! She also reveals painful memories from her past with grace, humor and dignity. Her honest appraisal of her experiences of that time is quite refreshing, and her humanity shines through with every word. This is not a woman who hides from her decisions, good or bad, but faces them with courage, honesty and determination. Did she make mistakes and have regrets along the way? Sure. We all have! Viewed through the prism of age and experience, there are things that we'd all like to take back, and Barbara is no exception. She writes about her experiences candidly, learns from them, and moves on the live life to the fullest every single day. I can think of no better way to live. She is much, much more than just another pretty face -- Barbara Leigh is a thoughtful, loyal and brave human being who took the lemons that life gave her and made lemonade. She is willing to share her experiences and insights with the reader, and we are all the better for being given an inside glimpse of a life that few people would even dream of living. Give this book a try, you'll be really glad that you did! Good for you, Barbara, and Well Done!!"},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"I recently finished Barbara Leigh's book The King, Mcqueen and the Love Machine. As an enthusiastic fan of Elvis and Mcqueen, her book was utterly fascinating.There are rare, vivid insights into how Elvis lived in Vegas in the early 70s...how he demanded a very regimented world of nightly shows, post-show dressing room audiences with worshipers, late night parties back in his suite with the Memphis Mafia, a bevy of beauties, and one special girl each night ...who he took behind closed doors at the end of the night.You'll enjoy a strange, enticing glance behind those bedroom doors: how he was a child, a rock star, a manipulator, a gentleman, an addict, a friend, and a deeply talented but utterly-flawed human. How obtusely insecure he was...and how he couldn't be left alone...insisting his woman sit next to him until he went to bed. How he doled out pills. And shower her with gifts.Mcqueen meets Barbara at a casting and later lands her a part in his film Junior Bonner, where they begin an affair under the Arizona sky and the disdain of Martin Ritt. Mcqueenloves her in many ways (asking her to move in with him as his marriage to Neil collapsed), and again, Barbara sincerely tells it how it was with a \\"supe\\". While Elvis insisted on dresses, Mcqueen chugged brews and loved her in blue jeans. He was raw, and unpolished...but always running from his childhood of abandonment and poverty. Barbara even played a captivating role as messenger between Ali Mcgraw and Mcqueen, until she no longer wanted part of the deception.There are thrilling moments in LA bars, Palm Springs, New York, on commercial shoots, in France, Mexico at Sinatra's...and much much more.Also fascinating...all three men knew of each others involvement with Barbara, and were drawn to her, not only because she was stunningly beautiful, but because she was honest with them...and had her choice of the cream of the A-listers. They saw her as a sincere friend, who wouldn't settle down. She was in ways, like they were...living larger than life.The photos of Barbara illustrate why these men were so captivated by her...she was the embodiment of raven-haired, flower-child beauty. Couple that with her sincerity and hunger for adventure and she was the angel so many men create in their mind.Finally, Barbara saw all three men once more, near the ends of their lives. Each of these men had fallen tragically towards the end...hard for us to imagine since they are forever burned in our minds as legends. Nonetheless, this book offers unique insights into their outlooks near the end.I highly recommend this fresh and revealing look at some of the greatest stars. Honest. Romantic. Sexy. Sad. it's all in here.And her new 2008 audio biography is just as amazing with real people playing the parts. Check it out here on amazon!!!"},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"If anyone ever lived a fast-paced and adventurous lifestyle it was Barbara Leigh during the 1970's.

She simultaneously dated the legendary Elvis Presley, #1 box-office star Steve Mcqueen and one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood at that time, James Aubrey. All this while continuing to balance her sucessful career as a top model and actress. Her ability to juggle a personal and professional schedule was masterful and a true work of art. Her story is sincere as she did not use her relationships to further her career although she very well could have. Her honest and sensitive story will bring you inside her relationships with three of the most powerful men in the entertainment industry. In true Hollywood style, the three men were actually nothing like their famous personas.

Barbara did an excellent job of not onlytelling all about her relationships with these guys,but she managed to intertwine her life story into itas well.Honestly, I'm not into heavy romance stories. So,no matter how much I love Barbara or how well herbook was written, I wasn't going to dwell on everyline.However, there were a few things which mademe raise an eyebrow. In particular, there were somedetails about The King's life which piqued myinterest.

He told meI was the spiritual number seven, based on my birthdate of November 16.\\"What I also like about the book, as the abovequote will suggest, is it's written in her voice.

Her life story has been so fantastic and exciting, that it should not only be a book, but a major motion picture. She has not only seen the world, but has met some of the very people that have shaped history. When I first heard about this book, I thought it was only going to cover the part of her life that took place in the early 70's. But it was so much more. From her childhood to current times. And her life story is just one adventure after another. This book is a must for anyone that is an Elvis, or Steve McQueen fan. It has such insight to what they were like when not in the public's eye. As I mentioned before, Barbara's life has had some very interesting twists in it. But to see how she handles three of the most powerful men that the entertainment industry has ever known, all at once, is just too exciting..... Hope you enjoy this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Barbara Leigh has lived an extraordinary life and it comes through page after page in this autobiography. The men she came in contact with throughout her life were both powerful and fasinating. It's interesting to see these men through the eyes of the woman who shared many moments in their lives. Great Pictures throughout the book."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"The book mostly focuses on an extremely brief period in Barbara Leigh's career, only a few months really, when she found herself caught up in a kind of young girl's dream of excess. She was pretty much going steady with the disgraced TV executive James Aubrey, father of a girl just about her own age. And she was being constantly wooed by a married man, Steve McQueen, who would tease her by telling her he was teetering on the edge of leaving Neile Adams for her. And then Aubrey took her to Las Vegas where she became the plaything of yet another married man, Elvis Presley, whose marriage to Prisicilla had a good two full years to go.Barbara Leigh can certainly write up a storm! She shows us all the most intimate details of McQueen's life, and Elvis too, how for example he was so sexually modest she never saw him naked. She describes how McQueen had a thing for dark brunettes who looked exotic, like herself, or Natalie Wood, or like her nemesis, Ali MacGraw, and she describes the way that the blondes who constantly threw themselves in McQueen's way were barking up the wronmg tree. Sure, he would sleep with them, but he had no respect for blondes, calling them \\"chippies,\\" a term Barbara had never heard before. I wonder how he got along with Candice Bergen when they made THE SAND PEBBLES together?Anyhow despite everything that happens in this book, you have to gape when she discovers that, out of them all, she loves the \\"Smiling Cobra\\" the best! He's the one who calls her \\"Indian,\\" another poignant detail. All the time she's acting like the supermodel, carefree playgirl of Hollywood, going to Sue Mengers' parties and buying outfits at Suzie Creemcheese on Elvis' credit cards, secretly she's nursing a deep sorrow that her beloved son can't be with her (she had him when she was very young). To his memory she dedicates this magnificent book for the ages."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Comming from the same area as Barbara and having many of the same dreams and aspirations of sucess as she,this book really hit home in a big way.I've seen 6 of her movies,one of the Playboy layouts ( slipped over to a friends house to sneak into his dads collection while his parents were away lol) and all of her Vampirella cover appearences.I first saw her on the Vampirella cover and was totaly taken with her beauty.After reading her book and also knowing a bit about her background im just totaly amazed by her.She is truly a remarkable woman in every respect.Knowing first hand how hard it is chasing sucess in the entertainment field(chased a music,writing career for 15 yrs)what she has accomplished thus far is nothing short of miraculous.Her story will make you run the entire gambit of emotions.One moment I was laughing out loud the next I was having to wipe my eyes(and Ga rednecks ain't supposed to cry)and the very next I was ready to fight for her.This book is truly moving to anyone with a heart and a must read for anyone with dreams of sucess in entertainment as her observations are dead on.Barbara sucessfuly takes you on a trip through her life and you truly feel as if you are right by her side during the whole thing from her humble beginnings to 3 of the worlds most sought after men all in a virtual knock down drag out competing for her attentions.I've been a fan of her acting and beauty for many yrs now and after reading this book I have nothing but the deepest of respect and admiration for the person she is."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"I don't like to read, but this book is easy reading and you can relax & enjoy it.I won't read the tabloid junk about Hollywood stars, but this is book is honest remembrances written by someone who truly loved and respected these men instead of using them for &#34;Fame & Fortune.&#34; For that, I respect her.One of the things that impresses me the most about Barbara Leigh is that she went from a poor child to foster homes to survivor to an exciting, elite lifestyle with highly rare experiences that most women in the world would envy. Obviously, she has a special charm, intrigue, and attraction. Just think about it: these powerful men, who had their pick of women, chose HER. How can you top that?I highly recommend this book, especially for Elvis & McQueen fans who want to know the inner side of these men."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"This is a beautifully written book!

Reading this book is a true trip back into time, one that truly makes you feel as if you were meeting Elvis for the first time and experience what it was like to be part of the whole &quot;road scene life&quot; with the King. This without a doubt is the best Hollywood love triangle story ever. After reading the book, one truly wonders what fights could still be going on in the &quot;Heavens&quot; over a girl named Barbara. Not only is this one of the best books you will ever read but lets not forget any unlocked diary of Vampirella's lovers is priceless alone......"},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"I have just finished reading Barbara Leigh's book for the second time. As the other reviews stated, it is hard to put down once you start reading, it is just so absorbing. One of the comments I would like to add to the other fine reviews is the fact that I, as a woman who has had many struggle in life, found great triumph in Barbara's story. Here is a woman from a sad childhood who made it through modeling, Hollywood, movies and powerful men without ever turning to crutches like Alcohol or drugs, much like many of her peers. This is a true story of a women's survival in a preliminary mans world. And I would like to point out, that while Barbara is still strikingly beautiful and still has a successful career...Elvis, Jim Aubrey and Steve McQueen are gone...two from either drugs or alcohol, and McQueen sadly from cancer. So here's to you Barbara.

Her ability to honestly and genuinely review each of her relationship's in the context of themselves and interacting with each other is a unique ability.Each relationship was obviously both important and singular to her. Each provided Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and Jim Aubrey the ability to be with a woman who truly appreciated them while not losing herself in their celebrity.Barbara's honest comments for both her triumph's and tragedy's while not hiding under any false pretense is a fresh and welcome relief endearing the reader to her. A true \\"free soul\\" in the '70's, her journey in and out of these three remarkable lives, some at the same time, is a honest commentary on the times she lived in and the social mores at the time.I had thought I knew as much of Elvis as anyone. Her book however showed me certain facets of his personality and soul which only added to my knowledge while teasingly enticing me to find out more. I did, still learning of his personality and values through her adventures with him. Her written observations of of Steve McQueen shows a man vuneralble in many ways, much against the \\"macho\\" persona I and the world had been groomed to believe. Her involvement with Jim Aubrey I found to the most complex yet saddest of the the three. This I found out not to be any fault of Barbara's but completely the result of his possessive nature and control minded attitude towards a woman at times I felt he saw as \\"his possession\\".Barbara, while not wriring in the Hemingway tradition , has offered a frank and honest portrayal of herself and her times in her own unique and personal style. Her book offers a true reflection of our society in the '70's and how her personal growth has evolved. This journey allowed Barbara to discover more confidence in herself allowing a unique commentary of hers life and these unique men's lives as well. As a result, both Barbara and the reader find themselves understanding ourselves much better as a result of her honest story telling, which is uniquely Barbara's."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Writer Barbara Leigh colorfully and honesty relives a real-life Hollywood fantasy in this thoughtful autobiography. Surrounded by a trio of colorful high-octane personalities, Ms. Leigh uses her unique relationships with each as counterpoint to her own perspective on life and love in the Hollywood fastlane of the 1970's. Fans of Elvis in particular will delight in her inside (and heart-felt)observations of &quot;the King.&quot; Many rare b&amp;w stills. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Not your average run-of-the-mill kiss and tell book. I bought this book because of my interest in Steve McQueen, and came away with a whole lot more! Barbara Leigh, lovely cover-girl, actress, and Playboy pictorial beauty (twice!), candidly reveals her life and passions. The majority of the book takes place during Barbara's turbulent but exciting escapades with three of the most famous and desirable men of their day (the period is 1970-72), Elvis, Steve McQueen and a big-shot Hollywood producer. Barbara is in her early twenties during this time, and her freshness in telling her story makes us, the reader, feel we're right with her! But there is much more to this story than just who's bedroom she's in. It's a story of courage, surivial, making the right choices even after having made mistakes, like we all do, and keeping your head up and moving on and up. I came away with nothing but admiration for Barbara, and recommend this book to anyone interested in a story of a brave woman full of life."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Interesting memoir that provides little insight into the lives of the book's title stars but reveals loads about the mindset of a starstruck woman. Ms. Leigh was a beautiful model with obvious talent but her lack of priorities and conscience was never fully explained and frankly left me baffled. Worse she dedicated the book to her son even though she chose to spend her time with married or disengaged men over being a mother to him during his childhood."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"From the minute you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down. From her humble beginnings, to her exciting Hollywood experiences, Barbara Leigh's story is written with sincerity and honesty. Her relationships are described in a way that conveys nothing but love and respect for the three men (Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and Jim Aubrey) she shared a time of her life with. I've always been a fan of Barbara Leigh from her film and modeling career, but knew nothing of her personal life. This book not only takes you through her life, but reveals fascinating insights to Hollywood and to some of its legendary people as well. My only problem with this book is that I eventually came to page 320 (it's the last page, and I could have easily read another 320). I absolutely recommend this book! As a side note: In one chapter, Barbara refers to herself as the \\"original\\" Vampirella. As far as I'm concerned, she is the ONLY Vampirella!"},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Enjoyed this book The life of Barbra Leigh is truly that of a legend Highly recomend it for anyone who is interested in Elvis's Shopping Habits or Steve McQueens Boldness"},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"The book was interesting,since I am an Elvis Presley fan, this is what made me buy this book.I did not like the nude photos of her in the book, I saw no reason for them....."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"i think like a lot of people she wrote the book to cash in on elvis, simple as that. she was just another notch on elvis\\"s bedpost, nothing more, nothing less.

I worked for Elvis for 18 years. We were very close.I was there the first day Elvis meet Barbara Leigh in Las Vegas.When her first saw her, he could not take his eye's off of her. Either could I. They just connected. They got to know each other very close.They had a wonderful relationship for a few years. One of the things I liked about Barbara's book is she was very honest about her life. She had some very hard times in her earlier years.This is the first time she has really wrote about her relations with her special men.I think she did a wonderful job writing this book on her life. I know it had to be hard on her. It's not easy writing a book about your life. I know.I really enjoyed reading it. And I know it is the truth because I was there. I have recomended it to a lot of my friends.It's a great story."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"\\"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine\\" is certainly much more than a catchy title; Barbara Leigh takes you on a rollercoaster ride through the heady 70's as she juggles her relationships with three of Hollywood's most powerful and influential icons while pursuing her carrier as an actress and model.For those of you who want to sample the \`authentic' Hollywood lifestyle of the 70's this book will certainly satisfy your appetite, and yet it offers much more. This is the Barbara Leigh story: - from her difficult childhood through to the privileged lifestyle of a Hollywood starlet, coupled with life's unexpected challenges, Barbara has experienced more than most will ever experience in several life times.The book is an easy read, reminiscent of a cool summer breeze or a favorite song that takes your mind back to people and events that shaped one's life. Throughout the book some truly beautiful pictures capture the free spirit and southern charm of Ms Leigh that also form an integral part of this autobiography.We also get a rare chance to observe the \`human' side of these legendary icons and how in their own way, coped with the burden of power and fame. It is clear that Barbara's affection for Elvis, Steve McQueen and James Aubrey was sincere and the fact that she did not use these men to advance her own carrier is a true testament to her class and dignity (a rare commodity in this day and age).I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would strongly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"This book is about a beautiful actress/model who had affairs with three powerful men: Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and James Aubrey.

I picked up Barbara's book in an attempt to learn something new and was captivated by her story. I read it from cover to cover in 24 hours and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful story of love, romance, heartache and intrigue. Barbara Leigh is just fascinating and tells her story in a classy yet juicy manner. I loved it!

Notice I use the term \\"living\\". I'm not talking about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" (Elvis), or the \\"Cooler King\\" (McQueen) or the \\"Lion King\\" (Aubrey), I'm talking about a \\"Queen\\". Barbara Leigh had a career in the Hollywood spotlight that lasted a little over 10 years as an actress, a little longer as a professional model, and for a lifetime the role that she will always be remembered for \\"The Original Vampirella\\". She is now and will always be the most stunningly beautiful woman ever to grace this earth. What is best about this book is that looks are not the only graces she possesses. She has lived a tremendous life, fraught with ups and downs that are frankly and openly discussed. There's many books on Elvis, but only one on Barbara. I'll take \\"The Queen\\" over \\"The King\\" anyday!"},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"Anyone who saw \\"Junior Bonner\\", and was entranced by Barbara Leigh's performance as Charmagne, cannot help but find this partial autobiography absorbing and rewarding reading. Similarly, anyone who saw and enjoyed the best of Elvis and Steve McQueen will be immediately attracted.This book is written from the heart; it is devoid of both the taint of the popular media and casual hype. The style is almost conversational, as the writer follows different related paths in recounting her various adventures with the three titular protagonists. From her tough childhood to the loss of her son, and the failure of her marriages, you cannot help but respond; if you can keep that lump out of your throat you are a better man than I, Gunga Din.It provides new insights into the worlds of movie-making and top-class entertainment; legendary director Sam Peckinpah needed a lot of convincing that Barbara was right for the role of Charmagne, and treated her abysmally , whilst Elvis' treatment of his lady friends and his entourage will no doubt surprise many of his fans.As a London-based Francophile, I would have been interested to hear more of her life in Paris with Roger Vadim, and in London with her husband, but these were all incidental to the title of the book.But be warned - this is no kiss-and-tell lurid account of an aspiring actress/model's encounters with three of America's successful men. As I said earlier, it is a candid review of part of Barbara's life which will provoke a response in the heart and spirit of any reader. I want to read it again, but my eldest daughter, a devoted Elvis fan, decided she wanted to read it first. OK, I can wait.Thank you, Barbara Leigh, for sharing your experiences with us."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"As a die-hard Elvis fan for the last 40 years, I bought Barbara's book solely to read about her relationship with him. But I was quickly captured with her entire life story, from her first recollections of her traumatic childhood, to the death of her beloved son, through her overcoming spirit of today.I easily have 30+ books on Elvis and without a doubt, this is in the top two or three. I was riveted by her memories of Elvis and her relationship with him. Barbara was blessed to know him and she often speaks of what a good heart he had. She writes about Elvis with love, loyalty and admiration. At the same time, she does not sugar-coat the drug use, mood swings and other human frailties.Beyond her physical beauty, one can readily see why Elvis was attracted to Barbara. One comes away with the clear sense that she is a loving, kind and nurturing person. The fact that Elvis kept in touch with her through the years is a testament to that fact. There are undoubtedly only a handful of women in his life who can make that statement.As the title of my review states, I bought this book because of Elvis but ended up loving the entire story. I invite all Elvis fans to do likewise. Barbara writes with candor, emotion and detail, the good and the bad, the bitter and the sweet. But she is never bitter. I felt as if I were right there with her through her entire story."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"As the other reviewers noted, this book focuses on a few years in Barbara's life in the 1970's when she was a young Hollywood starlet making movies with actors such as Rock Hudson, Steve McQueen, and Tom Selleck. and modeling for all the big companies. She tells of her fast-paced work and romantic life involving some of the most powerful men in the entertainment business: Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen, and Jim Aubrey.While she shared with the public a side of all three men that was unique to the public hungry for personal information about celebrities, she did so in a way that I found to be respectful and loving to these men, without intent to trash their memories. I came away with the feeling that she still cherishes each one and her time with them. I'd bet she's a classy lady.I remembered watching Barbara in movies in the early '70's simply because of her stunning beauty. I was happy to read her book and learn more about her and her life. There were some beautiful photos of her in this book, and I'd love to see a book published of nothing but photos of her, in larger sizes. (For the record, don't take this wrong--I like men!!)When I started reading this book I could hardly put it down. It was well-written, as well has having interesting subject material.

From her early povery-stricken childhood, to her incredible relationships w/ Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen, & James Aubrey, it's as though you are her best friend, along for this amazing rollercoster, hearing all this from her own mouth. I especially loved the the chapters dealing with Elvis, & actually felt the hairs on my arm stand on end, as Barbara tells of being with The King Of Rock N Roll, like no one else has ever revealed. The photos of Ms. Leigh are absolutely breathtaking, & she has actually become more beautiful, inside as well as out, as time has passed. Somehow, she has managed to stay the same lovely, charming , \\"Southern Gal\\" she was, when she had nothing, to ...Barbara Leigh, celebrity extraordinaire, which is a gift that money just can't buy...When you finish this book, the most amazing factor to remember is that all this happened to just one very fascinating lady...The book also details her rise to Playboy, where she now works, to being the living incarnation of Warren Magazine's sultry Vampirella...To put it bluntly, I'm very jealous of Elvis, Steve, & James, because Barbara is that rare lady, that's truly \\"One In A Million\\"...Continued success, darlin'..."},{"Title":"The King, McQueen and the Love Machine: My Secret Hollywood Life with Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen and the Smiling Cobra","review":"As an avid reader of autobiographies &amp; biographies of all things Hollywood, I found this book to be one of the best ever written by a Hollywood actress.

It really seemed to drag, had fewer characters and story lines than the other books. Nell and Travis, the two main characters of this book are not quite as interesting as the other match ups that usually populate her novels. The mystery of Bitter End does get solved, but that part of the story was really slow. Also, I felt that the minor characters like Nell's two children and her mother-in-law were not very well drawn.I know that Debbie Macomber fans are very loyal, so I am sorry if this offends some of you, but maybe I have read too many of her books with the same plot."},{"Title":"Nell's Cowboy (Heart of Texas, No. 5)","review":"Nell's Cowboy:I didn't really like this one. There were not enough encounters with Nell and Travis, though I did like them and liked the idea of the story. The author just spent way too much time on going over what was in the first four books. That might have been good if I hadn't read them, and especially if I hadn't JUST read them. The writing was well done, just the story of the two main characters was so brief, it was hard to get into it.I did like what she did with the results to the Bitter End Town. Very creative.I just had to add the next review, especially since it goes along with this one in the, Heart of Texas Vol 3. I hate giving a bad review, especially when all the others in the series were good. As is the other books I've read by, Debbie Macomber.Lone Star Baby:Now this one was MUCH better. This one really got into the story of the two main characters, not hitting so much on the other characters from the previous stories or over doing it about what happened with Bitter End. The author really developed these two characters relationship.This one made me laugh, often and brought about that \\"good feeling\\" about the characters, too.

Every chapter has a gentle message about dealing with bullying, selfishness, pride, gossip, etc. That said, the often comic presence of the disagreeable animals is also tempered by Gannett's insertion of sympathetic aspects; for example, the rhinoceros. Elmer's inquiry about why the rhinoceros is in such a temperamental frame of mind is a real lesson in kindness and seeking to understand someone on a deeper level. Elmer's cleverness, bravery and faithfulness to his word are admirable traits but if parents and instructors are looking for really rich discussion, the personalities and behavior of the animals of Wild Island yield some really rich conversation and opportunities to teach."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This series is highly imaginitive with a smart and clever protagonist, Elmer. The fantastic world that he lives in is realistic, consistent and logical. This is one of those books that you will actually enjoy reading with your kids - and is suitable for nearly any age.Children model themselves after characters in books and on TV, and Elmer is worth idolizing. He is matter-of-fact, independent, respectful and resourceful, as we all wish our children would grow up to be.The author never resorts to things on my \\"no\\" list: high-peril plots, ignorant or stereotypical characters, killing off one or more of the protagonists parents, pedantic or lesson-oriented text.... or the numerous other things that authors do while trying to \\"sell\\" a book."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This might be the book that gets your reluctant, or comic book obsessed child into reading. This book includes a dialogue with an alley cat on the first page...a map of imaginary lands, and a clever story about imaginative trickory of various animals. I haven't seen a lot like this out there for the 7-10 year old readers. It also makes for great bedtime reading, as the adventure is gentle, the pictures not too frequent, and the text soothing, descriptive, and rhythmic."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"These books are so special because they capture thae minds of all readers, and mean somthing more to younger kids because, Ruth Ganett use her imagineation as is she could go into a mind of an kid 5-9 and speak their thoughts. I am an avid reader, so out of all the books I've read this is one I will cherish forever. Everyone should read it even if a 190 year old person special ordered a super deluxe HUGE print version, they would still enjoy it."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This was a great book because it's about a kid and a dragon. In this book a kid named Elmer finds an alley cat. The alley cat tells Elmer about a baby dragon on Wild Island. Elmer goes to Wild Island. Alot of animals that try to eat him but he saves the dragon and they fly away. This is a great book."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This is a wonderful book to introduce your animal-loving 4 year-old to chapterbooks. The illustrations hold enough interest while reading the chapters to make for an easy transition from picture books to chapter books at bed time. My son loved the wacky animal behaviors and would regularly beg for \\"one more chapter\\". The sentence structure is varied and interesting enough to hold an adult's interest as well while reading out loud (the same goes for the vocabulary). The large print is easy on your eyes and great for beginning readers who want to venture into the book on their own. Two sequels ensure several weeks of bedtime reading."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This book is by Ruth Stiles Gannet. It is fiction because a dragon is in it and animals talk in it. Ruth Stiles Gannet wrote My Father's Dragon a couple years after finishing college in 1944. This book was a great success and won a Newberry award.The main character is a boy named Elmer. Elmer wishes he could fly. He finds a stray cat that knows a dragon that can take him on a flying ride. Before he can do that, Elmer has to free the dragon from Wild Island that has an extremely thick forest. The dragon is a slave of the animals in the jungle and is used to fly them across the river on the island. To free the dragon, Elmer has to get by vicious animals that want to eat him.My Father's Dragon makes me feel that I'm in a jungle getting chased by ferocious animals. I loved reading this book because Elmer goes on a gigantic adventure. I recommend this book for people who like reading adventurous stories. Also, it won the Newberry award."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"My Fathers Dragon is the first book out of a series of three. It is a fiction story about a kid named Elmer, who loves to go on adventures. One of his adventures is rescuing a baby dragon that has been captured by animals, and taken to Wild Island to be used as a way to get across the river there. Elmer hears this news from a stray ally cat that he finds one day, and decides he's going to run away and go to Wild Island to free this dragon. Elmer has to outsmart a bunch of animals to get to the dragon, but it's easy for him because he's really clever. I thought the book was very exciting and fun to read. It's the kind of book you don't want to put down and want to read it over and over again. I gave this book such a good rating because it was fun; I never got tired of it. It was a great book!!!! I would recommend it to anyone that likes thrilling and adventurous books. I liked this book because it was easy to understand, it's funny, and exciting. It's a fun book to read to your self, or to a little brother or sister. No matter how old you are you will always enjoy it. This book is ten chapters long with about 5 to 6 pages each chapter and the chapters are very easy to read. This book would be good for kids that are starting to read chapter books because the words in it are easy to understand and it has pictures in it and they are very detailed. Also in every book there is a detailed map showing where things are and where Elmer went and it's really fun to look at them.

The story is thought provoking enough to be a great spring board for discussion with older children, yet endearing enough for little ones to stand up and cheer about.

This book, first in a series of three, engages a child's imagination in a story that is complete make-believe. The story begins when Elmer Elevator (the narrator's father as a boy) runs away with an old alley cat to help rescue a flying baby dragon that is being mistreated on faraway Wild Island. While at Wild Island, he encounters tigers, a rhinoceros, lions, gorillas, and monkeys. Elmer uses the things he carries in his backpack to fight off all of the wild animals on his way to save the dragon. A few of the items that he uses are pink lollipops, rubber bands, chewing gum, and a fine-toothed comb. It is through these crazy adventures that Elmer eventually rescues the dragon from its torment. My Father's Dragon is a hilarious tale that will keep children laughing and will induce creativity. This book allows the children's imaginations to run wild. The author, Ruth Stiles Gannett, continued this style of writing in the last two of the trilogy, Elmer and the Dragon and The Dragons of Blueland."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"My father's dragon is a great book.If you enjoy excitment then read this book.Elmer wants to fly a plane.So when meets a cat that can talk the cat tells Elmer about a dragon that is tied up on the island of Wild Island he decided to find Wild Island and free the dragon.Anybody who goes to Wild Island never comes back alive.But Elmer comes back alive because he frees the dragon and flies the dragon back to his home town.That is what this book is about."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"My kindergarten class loved My Father's Dragon and Elmer and the Dragon.

I would recommend this book to my friends. This book was so well written that I believed cats could talk.The story begins one day when a boy finds a cat on the street. The boy is the narrator's father many years ago. The cat and the boy became best friends. His mom was so upset and didn't let the cat stay in the house. This was an unusual cat because it could talk. The father told the cat he wanted to be a pilot. He liked flying a lot. The cat told him about a dragon and that he could fly on the dragon's back. The dragon lived on Wild Island. Wild Island was a dangerous place to travel to because there were wild animals. The father decided to go there. The father survived on Wild Island because he was making the animals happy by giving them things he brought from home.The narrator's father was a little boy that time. He was brave and very clever. He had a big heart. The cat could talk to people, and normally cats can't. He came from Tangerine Island and back to the mainland.When I read this story, I believed casts could talk. The story was exciting becasue the father talked to animals. Animals had different feelings like anger or happiness. It did seem like a real story. I think the message was if you want to make something happen, imagine it first and then make it real. Also you need to be smart and brave to survive."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This book was amazing.I was surprised that the book was so good.

I would recommend it and hope it brings them fond childhood memories."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This was the first chapter book I read to my son, when he was 4, and I couldn't have found a better choice. The story is simple and easy to follow &#8212; a nine-year-old boy saves an enslaved baby dragon and then flies home on the dragon's back. The book's language is simple and direct. And there's a black and white drawing on almost every other page, which is perfect, because most young children still need a picture to look at while they're listening.The best thing about the book for me was that even though there's plenty of action (mostly involving the little boy outsmarting a series of wild animals in order to reach the dragon), there's nothing the least bit scary here. That was very important to me as the mother of a four-year-old. The book was written in the forties, and it has a sweet, gentle, old-fashioned quality that it's hard to find in any form of entertainment for young children today. (Even Disney is too intense for a lot of four-year-olds.) It has the kind of innocence most of us would like our children to be able to hang on to for a few years.My son loved the book so much we read it over and over again, and went on to read the other two books in the series (Elmer and the Dragon and The Dragons of Blueland) many times as well.Years later, when he was in third grade, his teacher mentioned to me that she was hunting for a chapter book to read to the class, but wasn't having much luck. Everything she looked at seemed beyond the attention span of many of the kids in her class. I told her about My Father's Dragon, but I also said it probably wasn't exciting enough to hold the attention of third graders. But she tried it anyway, and later told me that kids who had never shown any interest in books were reminding her every day to read another chapter. She, too, went on to read the whole series.It's a great introduction to chapter books. More important, it's a lovely, gentle book to share with a child."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"I've been expecting my seven year old son to become, like the rest of the world, an addict of the Harry Potter books, but no dice.Instead, he came home from his multi-age class rhapsodizing about a book I had never heard of...My Father's Dragon. And although I haven't read it (yet), I can tell you for sure what happens in the first five chapters, because my son tells us all with such verve and enthusiasim about the adventures that take place there! How the narrator's father gets out of the tigers, and builds a bridge with the crocodiles are two of his favorite parts, and the words &quot;Bome Cack! Bome Cack!! have entered our vocabularies probably forever.I think the three books in this series will be entering our household at Christmas time, and I can't wait to read them myself!"},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"MY FATHER'S DRAGON tells the story of Elmer Elevator.

But will this be enough to face lions, tigers, gorillas, and crocodiles?This is a fun early reader chapter book. The chapters are the perfect length to hook the beginning reader. The story is imaginative, delightful, and downright funny in spots while still being simple enough for young kids to follow. I reread it recently for the first time in years and was surprised at how short and simple it really was. When I was a boy, it seemed much longer and more complicated. There are numerous drawings that wonderfully highlight some of the funnier parts of the story.

I love the characters, the alley cat, elmer's mother, the dragon, all the animals on the island...they are all loaded with human insecurities and flaws...that I (unknowingly) learned of soo young. I still dream of the images.. elmer hidden in a bag of tangerines. a braided & bowed lion. a tusk-toothpaste-brushing rhinosaurus. The illustrations are absolutely inspiring to children. To this day, at 22, 17 years since I first fell in love with the characters, I cherish a photo-copied illustration of the rhino brushing his tusks. The list of supplies needed for elmer's journey, I can still see in my head. This was the first book I remember being excited to master (as a reader).

The chapters are short and simple, and it moves along at a nice pace. It's action based, which is what makes it so attractive to younger readers. I think it has special appeal to kids who don't like to sit still for a book. Both of my sons and my daughter count it as one of their favorite books from childhood.Briefly, it's the story of Elmer Elevator, a nine-year-old boy that sets out to rescue a captured baby dragon. Armed with chewing gum, lollipops, magnifying glasses and other unlikely rescue devices, Elmer encounters lots of obstacles along the way. He's an independent, resourceful boy who manages to come up with clever solutions to the many problems that arise on his journey.

When my children were little, I kept digging through my parents' attic, looking for this one. (It would have helped if I'd been able to remember the name of it... what stuck in my head were the tangerines, gum, rubber bands, and lollipops.) Finally, when my youngest was six, Mom excavated it and I was able to read it again. Still funny, still sweet, and I still love the lollipops! What's more, my son (now 8), adores this book and still occasionally requests it for nighttime reading.For his 7th birthday, I bought him a copy of \\"Three Tales of My Father's Dragon,\\" which continues the story with two sequels. However, in my opinion neither of the sequels has quite the charm of the original. My kid doesn't agree; he likes them all.CHapters are short and simple; plot is full of action and suspense (but nothing scary). Story is more plot-oriented than language- or character-oriented -- but that's okay when you're dealing with a kid that loves action. And as I've pointed out, even though I'm a \\"language lover,\\" I enjoyed this one enough to pursue finding it, 30 years after first reading it."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"Let's just keep it simple.

I liked the book because it was interesting and exciting. Also, I liked the it because the book was fiction. Another thing I liked about the book is that it was an adventure book. That is why I liked the book.The best part of the book was at the end when Elmer and the dragon were flying away from Wild Island. I liked that part of the book the best because all the animals that had tried to kill Elmer were going to be eaten by the crocodiles. Also I liked that part of the book the best is because Elmer and the dragon got away from the island. That is what I think is the best part of the book.One of the most vivid parts of the book was the setting because it was very descriptive and I could picture it in my head. Another vivid part of the book was the characters, because they all had their own unique personalities and qualities. Those are what I think are the most vivid parts of the book."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago, in first grade.

I'm going to try to read it again someday. Although this book is said to be for 9-12 year olds, I would definately say it's for 8 and under kids, maybe nine at a stretch (average books for my age group I read three years ago). If you're trying to get your kid to read, buy them this book. Nice and easy, but with enough action to satisfy any imagination."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"Elmer Elevator, the narrator's father, is nine years old when he meets a talking alley cat, who tells him about his journey to a Wild Island where a baby dragon is held captive, forced to ferry animals across the river that divides the island. Elmer, annoyed with his mother for being rude to the cat, packs twenty-five peanut butter sandwiches, six apples, and assorted gear and stows away on a ship bound for the nearby Tangerina, then crosses a bridge of rocks to explore the island. There he outwits a succession of fierce animals bound on devouring him and frees the dragon.This story is masterfully written, in very short chapters that each pack a punch and end with a cliffhanger. The plot points are simple enough that young children will be able to follow them, but clever enough that adults will enjoy the author's absurd sense of humor. It's perfect for children transitioning out of picture books. Published in 1947, it reflects mainly wholesome values of kindness, courage, and generosity, with a naivete that will appeal to children who enjoy this kind of playful fantasy.Some concerns that parents ought to consider when deciding about this book are that (as in many fantasies of this type) Elmer does disobey his mother by feeding the alley cat and sneaking out for walks with him. He also runs away, and during his travels he lies to some animals in order to protect himself. His mother does relent about the cat, and Elmer never lies outright to his parents, who in a later book welcome him home with glad relief. These moral elements can be dealt with through discussion, but the power of the story is far greater than a conversation. I believe that the warm family relationships, and other positive values in the story outweigh the effect Elmer's rebellion and lying.All told, this is a positive, funny and lighthearted fantasy with a potentially problematic plot device of lying and running away."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"It is a good funny book. If you love to laugh hard this is your book! There is a boy who is trying to save a baby dragon. The boy has to go through a lot of chaos to help the dragon! it is funny, and it will teach you a lot about animals!

He goes to a island. He was trying to set a baby dragon free. He met with all kinds of baby animals and they all want to eat him, but they have special needs and he treats those needs so they don't eat him.I really like the story. I think it is awesome. But it could have a little more ending like the dragon flies home and meets mom. The person who wrote this book is Roth Stiles.

Elmer hers this news from a stray ally cat that he finds one day, and decides he going to run away and go to Wild Island to freethis dragon. Elmer has to outsmart a buch of animals to get to the dragon but it's easy for him because he's relly clever. I thought the book was very exciting and fun to read.

To make it really special, get yourself a backpack and fill it with the many things that are used during this adventure...like a pair of rubber boots, chewing gum, etc. The children love the anticipation of seeing what will come out of the backpack next. Of course we shared the lollipops. Great fun and a great book to read aloud to your classroom."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This is a great book because it was adventurous.

The book isn't any longer than it needs to be, which is good, and I loved the part where the tigers chew on bubble gum, but I think I expected the book to be a lot weirder, and was kind of let down.All of the animals talk, and this is never explained. I kind of like the lack of explanation actually, and I like the hiding kid being mistaken for a bag of corn.The plot moves very briskly. The kid says he wants to fly, the cat he meets tells him how to find a dragon, and in the next scene, he's off to find a dragon, simply because he said he wanted to fly one time. Of course, later he wants to rescue the dragon simply to end its mistreatment.I'm sure this book is fun to read if you're a little kid, or if you're reading to a little kid, but if you're an old man reading it by yourself for the very first time, you kind of hope Willy Wonka will show up or something. I didn't read much when I was little, so I don't know what I'm talking about. You wouldn't have to twist my arm to get me to agree that this is a perfect first chapter book. It's a good length.The illustrations are beautiful, by the way. They're very, very well done."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"The book My Father's Dragon by Ruth Stiles Gannett was a blast. I could read it all day. The book was about a child, the narrator's father, having many adventures. First, the child met a cat. Second, he needed to ride across to the Wild Island. Third, he releases the dragon from the chains on the island. Last, he flew across the island with the Dragon's help. The boy met many animals on the path to the dragon.The child is the most important character in the book because he is clever. When he gives things to the animals, they won't hurt him. I like him because he is nice to the animals, but I wouldn't want to hang out with him because he had funny clothes. Some of the animals surprised me by the way they acted. For example, the crocodile ate the lollipop and left the child alone. I thought the crocodile would eat him. Instead of attacking the boy, the lion wanted a comb to brush his mane.I would give this book three stars. This book is good sometimes and bad other times. I would not recommend this book. I don't think older boys would llike it, either. Girls might prefer this book because of the animals and cats. The book cover is not good because it has an ugly picture of the boy and hanging hearts. Inside the book the pictures of the animals are good, but the pictures of people are horrible. This book would be better without the pictures. The print size was medium so it was easy to read."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"At the end of the book, the other animals going to get eaten by the aligators is seen as a joke.

The story is told by his child, his daughter, we think. He goes on a big adventure, trying to rescue a baby dragon.

But he also told the father, Elmer Elevator, that there was ferocious animals on the island. Elmer Elevator frees the dragon because he was a very smart boy.We liked this story because it is a really good story about a dragon and a father when he was a nine year old boy. It was a LITTLE funny and it was a really BIG adventure."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"My 11 year old son has read all 3 of these books in 3 days.

Great for all ages!"},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"My Father's Dragon, written by Ruth Stiles Gannett and illustrated by Ruth Chrisman Gannett, is written for kids my age. It is about 85 pages long. It has many pictures that make the book fun to read.My Father's Dragon is the story of an amazing adventure that the narrator's father had when he was a little boy. It starts when the boy showed a stray cat some kindness by giving it a home and food to eat. One day, the cat finds out that the narrator's father had always wanted to fly in an airplane. This cat had traveled far and it told the boy about a dragon that was a prisoner on a wild island full of ferocious beasts. If the boy could free the dragon, the cat thought that, in return, the dragon would carry the boy on its back as it flew around. In this way the boy would get to fly.The narrator's father immediately set out on an adventure to free the dragon. He met many dangers and animals that he tells about. On the way, he runs into many beasts of the forest: tigers, turtles, boars, a rhinoceros, and even a gorilla. You'll have to read the book to see if the boy ever gets to fly.I think the characters in this book are very interesting. They all have their own personality and everyone is different from each other. They talk like real people and do stupid things like people do sometimes. My favorite characer is the dragon because I felt so sad for him. I wanted him to get away from the other animals that were hurting him.I liked the vocabulary and the writing style of this book. The author didn't think the reader was dumb, and she added a lot of details that made the story very interesting. The sentences were short and easy to read, but they made me want to keep reading. The author didn't let the story get boring at any time.My Father's Dragon is a good book that everyone about my age (8) will enjoy reading. If you are a boy or girl that dreams about having a wonderful adventure and if you like wild animals and strange places, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"This book is by Ruth Stiles Gannett. It is fiction because a dragon is in it and animals talk in it. Ruth Stiles Gannett wrote My Father's Dragon a couple years after finishing college in 1944. This book was a great success and won a Newberry award.The main character is a boy named Elmer. Elmer wishes he could fly. He finds a stray cat that knows a dragon that can take him on a flying ride. Before he can do that, Elmer has to free the dragon from Wild Island that has an extremely thick forest. The dragon is a slave of the animals in the jungle and is used to fly them across the river on the island. To free the dragon, Elmer has to get by vicious animals that want to eat him.My Father's Dragon makes me feel that I'm in a jungle getting chased by ferocious animals. I loved reading this book because Elmer goes on a gigantic adventure. I recommend this book for people who like reading adventurous stories. Also, it won the Newberry award."},{"Title":"My father's dragon","review":"I was very glad we found these books. Our four year old absolutely loved them. They were a great introduction to chapter books and he couldn't get enough. One of the nice perks of these books is that as an adult, you will enjoy the fanciful story, too. The only negative is that there is a bit of violent content, such as, the gorilla threatens to twist Elmer's arms just like he does to the dragon's wings. We are very sensitve to that sort of content and it wasn't enough to cause any nightmares.I highly recommend and enjoyed reading these books to my son."},{"Title":"Spain for the Sovereigns (Ferdinand and Isabella, 2)","review":"The middle book of the spanish trilogy, 'Spain for the sovereigns' even by itself is an absorbing book. It not only brings out the personalities of Fredinand and Isabella, it also tells the sweeping changes that Spain went through during their reign. This book ends magnificently, with both the sovereigns looking to the future which promises. Jean Plaidy attempts to explain the inquisition in context of their reign (In fact she wrote non fictional books about the inquisition after these), so you sort of understand why it happened even when you dont condone it. Its truly a remarkable book and I would highly recommend this to anyone who might be interested in how Spain was united under one throne."},{"Title":"Spain for the Sovereigns (Ferdinand and Isabella, 2)","review":"This book is about Isabella and Ferdinand's quest to unite Spain. To do so they have to take it from the Moors, and that's not an easy thing to do, but first they have to make sure that Isabella stays queen of Castile because her \\"neice\\" has people fighting for her claim to the throne. I felt this was the most interesting part of the book. You're also introduced to Christopher Columbus, under his Italian and Spanish names so it's the same person. That was interesting, but he actually got on my nerves where beforehand I felt nothing for him. (From history class anyway.) And I felt that she could have spent more time on the Moors. They were very important to this whole thing and they felt like tertiary characters. Maybe secondary should have been better.I very much enjoyedCastile for Isabella, the first in the triology, but didn't so much enjoy this one. I felt it was very one note. I learned things I didn't know, or had things I know expanded upon, but I felt like I didn't get to know Isabella or Ferdinand, or their children, very well at all. I felt like an outsider looking in. And that bothered me a lot.It's still a good book, and very important for the trilogy. It's not one of those books you can skip and still totally understand what's going on."},{"Title":"Coleridge The Laurel Poetry Series","review":"Coleridge is most known as a poet for the two great 'fantastic' works 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', and ' Kubla Khan'. But he is also the author of a different kind of poem entirely, what came to be calleed ' conversation poems'. These poems in a colloquial language usually as M.H.Abrams pointed out begin with the contemplation of a landscape, and involve a meditation upon a problem, a life - dilemna, a moral question and lead to some kind of resolution in greater understanding. Among the poems of this kind are:The Eolian Harp (1795)Reflections on having left a Place of Retirement (1795)This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison (1797)Frost at Midnight (1798)Fears in Solitude (1798)The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798)Dejection: An Ode (1802)To William Wordsworth (1807)These poems and their method are considered too to have played a part in the practice of Wordsworth when the two great geniuses of Romantic Poetry were working together on 'The Lyrical Ballads'.Perhaps none of the lines of the Conversation poems have the haunting,lyrical,memorable qualities of the great longer-poems but they are essential to understanding the complex - world of poetic feeling of one , who unlike his great friend Wordsworth never seemed to know real calm, but rather thrive primarily by struggling through confusions and contradictions."},{"Title":"Convex Optimization","review":"I want to like this book.

This one is definitely not worth the money. It leaves out a lot of important details and is utterly useless if you're trying to learn the material on your own. There are no solved exercises either."},{"Title":"Convex Optimization","review":"Quite simply, this is a wonderful text. Coupling this with Boyd's course at Stanford (the lecture videos, HWs, etc. are all available for free online), you're bound to learn quite a lot about optimization. But most importantly, you'll have an idea of when you can actually apply convex optimization to solve a problem that comes up in your particular field.My reasoning in giving it such praise is my preference for the rather unusual methodology it takes in introducing you to optimization. Most books I have seen on linear programming or non-linear programming tackle a few standard problems, introduce what is necessary in terms of definitions and proofs, and then focus on the algorithms that solve these standard problems (conjugate gradient et. al.), how they work, their pitfalls, etc. While this is undoubtedly useful material (which Boyd does cover for a good deal in the final chapters), the simple fact of the matter is these algorithms are available as standard methods in optimization packages (which are abstracted from the user), and unless you are actually going into developing, implementing and tweaking algorithms, this quite honestly is useless.What this book attempts to do, and does very well in my opinion, is to teach you to recognize convexity that's present in problems that are first glance appear to be so incredibly removed from optimization that you might never consider it. This book spends the first 100 pages or so just devoted to building a \\"calculus\\" of convexity, if you will, so that you know through what operations convexity is preserved, and you develop intuition as to the potential to use convex optimization in problems in your particular field or application. As such, the first part of the books is focused on building up the skill set, the second part to applications of convex programming, and only the third to the actual algorithms.A word of warning: some of the explanations (especially in Chapter 4 which focuses on types of convex programs and equivalence of programs) are very general, which won't be satisfying to certain readers who need solid examples to reinforce the concepts. Also, a lot of the material can be quite challenging, requiring a bit of mental gymnastics. However, if you are accompanying your study with the problems at the end of each chapter, you're certain to get practice and demystify the concepts.In sum, all things considered, a great text."},{"Title":"Convex Optimization","review":"I think this is the best book for getting into optimization. It's simple with many examples and figures. Excellent choice for engineers, mathematicians might find it incomplete, but what can we do, that's life.

You can download it for free from his website http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/ along with many other notes. Nemirovski's book is very complete and has very modern ideas new to many engineers. But as I said Boyd's book is where you should start from. From an engineer's perspective I believe Boyd's book is much more easy to read and understand than Bertseka's bookConvex Analysis and Optimization.

This should EASILY have been both scary and intensely erotic --- but it was NEITHER!!! Problem #1: Too many P.C. authors, trying to make their lesbian vampires champions of the political plight of lesbian women --- BORING!!! Problem #2: Very poor mixing of terror and sensuality, which like terror and humor can very often mix together very well! Problem #3: Isn't the whole vampire thing usually portrayed as an older evil guy rapaciously pursuing innocent, virginal young women? So what's so hard about replacing the older guy with a beautiful slightly older woman, having her seducing pretty young women with or without their consent?

I actually _learned_ about what I was reading in the stories that followed. Second, the book provides an outlet for what are historically and contemporarily undervalued authors of meaningful horror stories, all respectful of the positive contribution of lesbian imagery and ideas in literature. No, this isn't an erotic pulp novel. It is also NOT the usual feminist PC approach in which all lesbian vampires are made out to be evil or pornographic characters. Instead, sexy and empowering images of lesbian vampires is celebrated in another luscious volume."},{"Title":"Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Vampire Stories","review":"I never imagined myself that I would buy a book of erotic vampire stories but I have. Several years ago I saw Kim Deal reading Pam Keesey's book in the pages of a magazine. I admit I was curious about the book being the huge vampire fan that I am. I try to avoid the more cartoonish, horror vampire novels that plagues the book market (i.e Tanya Huff). I found a copy of the book at a local bookstore and decided to get it, not so much for the titilation of the sexual depictions described in the book but more from a feminist point of view in terms of female empowerment. In the introduction, Pam explores female empowerment through mythology, namely the supernatural as in vampires and other demons. I was tired of reading the same ridiculous cheesy vampire novel where women were usually the helpless victims or the sultry demon. I was more interested in reading stories of female vampires and how they differentiate from their male counterparts. I thought the stories were interesting to say the very least. And they are definitely different. One of the more interesting stories in the book was \\"Lousiana: 1850\\" by Jewelle Gomez. This particular story wasn't something I was expected. Normally I am used to reading about vampires who kill without prejudice and without conscience. Gilda was far from any vampire character I have read in any book. She didn't get off on killing people, let alone kill her victims. She merely would take a drink from her victim and leave. \\"Lilith\\" is more in tuned with any modern vampire novel where the vampire's intentions is completely sinister. The vampire seduces her victim and vamps her. The one story I didn't enjoy was \\"Carmilla\\" which honestly I found to be a complete bore. I have tried to read it in its entirety but I could not muster up the energy to finish the story, let alone get into it. Otherwise I enjoyed the majority of the stories in \\"Daughters of Darkness\\" (as well as in \\"Dark Angels\\"). If anything, Pam Keesey's books weren't entirely intended for titilation because the stories certainly underline female empowerment or feminism in some sort of way.

All of the Chick Bowdrie stories come from these earlier pulp western magazines. In BOWDRIE and BOWDRIE'S LAW there are a total of 18 western stories. I am aware of one additional Chick Bowdrie story in a later book beginning on page 89 of the 1998 book MONUMENT ROCK entitled Strawhouse Trail.I disagree with a few of the reviewers in that I think these stories represent some of the finest material Louis L'Amour ever issued to the reading public. The writing is of a high level and the stories really flow swiftly along, of course, that was essential in the short story market of that time. These stories are much less 'formulaic' than many of Louis L'Amour's later books, exhibiting a bit more dash. Few, if any, of his short story collections can ever eclipse these two books. I've been reading them now for well over 20 years and never tire of the Chick Bowdrie character.Charles (Chick) Bowdrie was orphaned at age six seeing his parents killed in a Comanche raid, thereafter living with the Comanches for several years before he was adopted out to a non-Comanche family. Learning both German and French in the area he lived he was well suited for all parts of Texas and his later work as a Texas Ranger. The stories in BOWDRIE all take place in Texas except for a couple stories, so Bowdrie is a ranger who does most of his work within the state. As a Texas Ranger he would have had to supply his own horse, pistols, and rifle, with the cartridges supplied by the state. Though he usually works alone he is part of a company of rangers with Rip Coker sometimes working with him. At least one story in Bowdrie finds that to be true.If you enjoy these stories of Bowdrie an excellent addition to the printed stories are the audio tapes or CDs of these books. To hear these stories dramatized and brought to life only adds to the depth and excitement of the Bowdrie character. If you read Louis L'Amour but have never read the Bowdrie stories great reading enjoyment awaits. I have the entire L'Amour collection of books in hardcover and have read these Bowdrie stories over-and-over. For me there are no finer Louis L'Amour stories available.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Bowdrie","review":"\\"Bowdrie\\" by famed western writer, Louis L'Amour is the second collection of stories about fictional 1880's Texas Ranger Chick Bowdrie. The book contains eight western style mystery stories in which Bowdrie solves crimes and stops outlaws. Interspersed between the stories are historical notes, detailing various events from 1880's Texas history and giving biographies of notable Texas rangers. I suggest that one read, \\"Bowdrie's Law\\" first, though is certainly isn't necessary as each of the stories contained in both collections can stand by themselves fairly well.I've never been huge into westerns, so when this book was suggested to me, I was a bit dubious. Of course, I'm familiar with Louis L'Amour, having read a book in Grade school, and seen a movie or two purported to have been based on his books, so I was willing to give it a try. I was glad I did.L'Amour's was a great writer. His knowledge of western history shows in his writing as he uses actual places and references real criminals and various events when they apply. He has an even, sometimes terse style that doesn't use more words than it needs to. His stories, in the case of the Bowdrie tales, are generally tightly written with clever and believable plots that don't violate the conventions of good mystery writing (\\"don't solve the mystery with evidence not previously revealed to the audience\\").In some ways the Bowdrie stories are the best of both worlds. They follow a western lawman hunting out criminals, often with a murder involved that he has to solve. There's the reasoning out of the crime and then an eventual showdown, often with a shootout or fight to climax the story. You get a good mystery and the western action to top it off. A great and entertaining combination.Added to that, Chick Bowdrie is a solid, interesting and likable character. It's no wonder that L'Amour wrote so many stories about him. He's a compelling fellow, an orphan with Apache blood who almost became an outlaw before being saved by the Texas Rangers. He rides a strawberry roan he caught himself that no-one else would dare ride and is too ugly to steal. He's shy with women despite his skill with his guns and he wanders here and there on various duties for the Rangers with no home but where he hangs his hat.With a great protagonist and the solid supporting characters created to interact with him, Bowdrie is a winner. As a result, this book is an entertaining read. Best of all, unlike a novel, each of the stories can be consumed in one sitting, great for that 30 minutes before bedtime."},{"Title":"Bowdrie","review":"Another terrific short story collection.

The author they call the New Louis L'Amour, whose real name is Kirby Jonas, seems to have taken the place of L'Amour for me lately. His stuff is a lot more authentic, I've found out since I started reading a lot more nonfiction.

By reading Halls other works, one will gather he has a solid understanding of human psychology. But this book does not venture too far into the psychological world, and for the most part remains an astrology book more than a psychology book. The book is laid out typically, with each sign getting its own chapter, and in groups according to their class (i.e. cardinal, fixed, common). I feel that the descriptions for each zodiac is not too far from what you would find in other well written (and understood) astrology books. This book is concise and to the point and makes no claims of right/wrong, better/worse. The use of this book is more for those who are practicing nativities and the like and who are, perhaps, looking for an alternate means of assimilating information. The zodiacal descriptions are all based on the Sun sign which must be considered when making an accurate reading of a horoscope.

Nonetheless, many of his views on the ancestry of different populations, based on morphology, linguistics, archaeology and the like, have been confirmed by recent genetic testing (see Cavalli-Sforza's &quot;History and Geography of Human Genes&quot; -- and, please, do read C-S' book, don't just satisfy yourself with C-S's deceitful cover stories about how poltically correct his finding are.)Baker's focus in the concluding chapters is on different races' capabilities to found a civilization. He gives a 23 point test of whether a culture can be reasonably considered a civilization, and examines various races' accomplishments in this regard. This book is worth reading in tandem with Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize-winning &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel,&quot; in which Diamond argues that every racial group in the world did as well as any other group could have with the resources of that region. Baker anticipated a number of Diamond's arguments and refutes them (e.g., could sub-Saharan Africans have put elephants to work like Asians and Carthaginains did?), but the truth probably lies somewhere between the two authors' views.Baker's exploration of the capability of different groups to start true civiliations is certainly interesting, yet, I wonder how relevant this question is to the modern world. The Japanese, for example, have shown relatively little talent at originating a civilization, but vast skill at borrowing others' novel ideas and adapting and, often, improving them. Similarly, the question of whether Africans could have invented a civilization on their own is interesting, but it's not as germane as Baker seems to assume to the more pressing question of how African-Americans can best fit into the existing American civilization. Further, some groups that did little to build their own civilizations, and still seem to have a certain amount of trouble fitting into others' civilizations -- e.g., sub-Saharan Africans and the Irish -- have contributed an extraordinary amount to the culture of modern life.Steve Sailer"},{"Title":"Race","review":"News and entertainment entities have almost always promoted the idea that to believe in any racial differences other than skin color means that you are uneducated and ignorant. A torrent of scholarly books on the explosive subject of race have disproved that dogma. In Part 1, Baker examines the historical thought on race, from the earliest attempts to define who we are, to the recent Hitler era. In Part 3, Baker approaches the issue from a biologic or taxonomic point of view. In order to diffuse the explosiveness of the issue, Dr. Baker examines the different races of various vertebrae animals and then moves on to more complex organisms -- humans. The differences in racial characteristics increases in proportion to how closely the subject is examined, and Dr. Baker examines racial features right down to the most detailed physical attributes. In Part 4, Dr. Baker examines the most critical attribute -- that of intelligence and race. It is here that Dr. Baker treads onto late twentieth century taboos. Dr. Baker's conclusion surprised me when I first read the book, though he tempers his understanding of racial inequality with the statement that &quot;no one can claim superiority simply because he or she belongs to a particular ethnic taxon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Race","review":"Baker's Race is not exactly meant for the amateur student of the \\"ethnic problem\\" , as he puts it. It has a lot of intimidating zoological terms in the book, which are often not explained. He also has a tendency to use French, German, Greek, and Latin words and quotes without explaining what he means. It is assumed you would know already. The book seems to be written for graduate students in biology and zoology and other academics. That being said there are some interesting sections in the book that aren't too pedantic and I only gave up and skimmed through about thirty pages when Baker's scientific zeal to analyze his subject down to the minutest details got the better of me. I preferred Rushton's Race, Evolution and Behavior over this one because of its conciseness and readability. Both are committed to objectivity.One of the best sections covers pre-colonial Africa in which Baker chooses seven authors who were early explorers of Africa based on their ability to describe the societies accurately and objectively. He comes to the conclusion that S.W. Baker was the best writer of the seven because of his writing's humor and pathos and his avoidance of tedious subjects such as tribal taxes. John Baker covers the cannibalism and the arbitrary and numerous executions that occurred in many of the tribes during the nineteenth century. There wasn't much law or value placed on life; one motion from the king could end the life of one of his subjects. There is a recounting of executions occurring after the death of one king's mother. Slavery was commonplace in pre-colonial Africa in which other captured tribes would become slaves of the other one dominating over them. Slaves were traded among tribes also.Before getting into the meat of his arguments, Baker likes to define important terms. Quoting a statement from the UN saying that we are all equal because we are all of the same species, Baker goes on to try to define what is meant by the word \\"species\\". Looking at other animals in nature, such as birds, he finds that birds with very small differences usually don't mate with each other and therefore can't be of the same species ,even though they are very similar. However, he states that animals in confinement and are domesticated become less choosy about their mates and many hybrids begin to occur. He then says that humans in civilization are the most domesticated of animals and therefore have the greatest tendency to become hybridized, much more than you would see among wild animals in nature. He comes to ambivalent conclusions as to whether we are all of the same species, mainly because it cannot be proven that hybridized types can remain fertile over many generations.The europids are examined fairly well. To the taxonomist, skin color is not an important factor in classifying race, so some taxon like the Aethiopids who look Negrid to the untrained eye are classified as predominately Europid by looking at the skull and other features of the body. It is in these other features that ethnic differences are determined by the taxonomist. Speaking of the Europids in Europe, they are actually hybrids of three subraces predominating in different areas: the Nordid in Northern Europe, the Alpinid in central Europe, and the Mediterranid in Southern Europe. Examples of hybrids would be the dark-haired Welsh in Britain who are Nordids with some of the Mediterranid blood of the people who settled there in early times before the invasion of the Nordid tribes like the Jutes, Angles, and Saxes who eventually mixed with them. Some of the features of the different subraces are mentioned such as the round head and stocky body of an Alpinid, as opposed to the narrow face and slender body of a Nordid.Bakers also examines the Jews, saying the Ashkenazi Jew that most people are referring to when they speak of Jews is closely related to the Armenians, a middle eastern Europid. There also seems to be some Orientalid blood in their lineage related to what are loosely called Arabs. There is also some unusual cases of a small percentage of people who are Jews by religion, but not related genetically to the Ashkenazim. There was a Khazar empire at one time that converted to Judaism, but their kingdom was destroyed by the Russians in the 10 century AD. They were not related to the Ashkenazi Jews of today. Baker also covers the physical features of the Ashkenazim.As far as the intelligence of the races go, Baker examines the IQ tests and the achievements of civilization of the races. He looks at whether race has created an achievement by itself or whether it has merely borrowed an idea from another race. He comes to conclusion that some Europid and Mongolid subraces have created their own civilization with the rest just borrowing or not getting to the point of civilization. He has a list of what would be an achievement that moves people from primitiveness to civilization such as whether they have invented the wheel, higher mathematics, language written in script referring to abstractions, a legal system, personal hygiene, or domestication of animals. Some Indianid races got halfway there such as the Mayans and Aztecs who had higher mathematics, but had the nasty habit of human sacrifice and cannibalism and no use of a wheel, deficiencies that kept them from being a high civilization.After studying the IQ test results, Baker says that Europid and Mongolids have about the same IQ, with Indianids further behind, and Negrids further still. He also does an interesting examination of hybrids of whites and blacks in the US showing that more Europid the hybrid the better they did on IQ tests. He looks at some of the black leaders such as Dubois and shows that these were actually Europids with a small amount of Negrid blood."},{"Title":"Race","review":"It was a very wise choice to provide a thorough,yet comprehensive book that promotes such lucid exposure of racial differencies,in such manner that not only it won't left anybody to doubt the existence of that reality,but also to provide certain historical digression that includes historical development of concept that explains why study of race remains something like the last taboo among sociologist and biologist,given that exclusion of racial factor in such diverse studies-anthropological,ethnological,historical and one of clinical medicine-in the name of aprioristic egalitarian idealism and &quot;political corectness&quot; can lead to generation of false conclusions,as author exemplifies trough essays on ethnicity and pseudoethnicity in the case of Celts and question of origin of modern Jews.Also,a very well documentated discourse is given on such issues as intelectual diferences among various ethnic,racial and socioeconomic groups with regard to cognitive and powers of deduction.Wide range of immplication deriving from constitutional differences among selected races are given,for example in sport achievments.These and many other fundaments of racial anthropology are exposed in an extremely free of any prejudice manner,and although conclusions may left an impression of right-wing milleau,this is certainly not a specimen of pejorative racist literature.Although this book has been published first time in 1974,it will remain worth reading for a long time.It's fundamental in the process of understanding the meaning of race."},{"Title":"A Rap On Race","review":"I have always loved the way Mr. Baldwin expresses himself; in a calm yet intense manner.

Here are some quotations from the book:JB: \\"I no longer care, to tell you the truth, whether white people can hear me or not. It doesn't make any difference at all. If they can hear me, so much the better; if they can't, so much the worse.

This book is a transcript of that conversation. In the beginning of the book it's seemed as if both were agreeing just for the sake of not wanting to hurt the other's feelings. Margaret in particular seemed to sound like a black person in that she was so quick to agree with James on the fact that blacks really have it hard in this country and it represents a serious barrier. I figured that after the first few pages that the conversation would be very boring. About half way into the book however, the pace of the conversation changed and got more interesting as they started touching on sexual issues. Toward the end, the conversation begain to get quite heated. James became very adamant and Margaret begain to interrupt him and assumed what he's was going to say before he said it. The conversation doesn't get heated until the subject of Jews is brought up. After finishing the book, I can't say that I've added too much of anything to my knowledge other than the indigenous people of New Guinea speak over 200 different dialects.I think the conversation lacked depth and has dated quite a bit. It would have been nice if they would have been able to expound more on the issues of religion and sexual selection but either one or both of them lacked knowledge in these areas or they simply shied away from talking about them. I also wish they would have talked about lynching to obtain some insight into the white southern mindset. James did talk about how he experienced a different mindset from white southerners as opposed to northerners, but he only scratched the surface of the subject. Black radicalism was also given scant attention.I wouldn't recommend this book strongly, but it is a nice book to read just for the sake of seeing how little things have changed since the sixties and seventies."},{"Title":"Artful Applique: The Easy Way (That Patchwork Place)","review":"Over 130 pages of great instruction and realistic photos that show that anyone who takes the time can do applique.

Not up to the pacing, depth or vision demonstrated by Cooper in \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", this book nevertheless continues the adventures of the wilderness scout Natty Bumppo (\\"Hawkeye\\" in \\"Mohicans\\" and \\"Pathfinder\\" here). Still the prototype of that strong, silent and simple man of virtue (who finds a higher moral calling in the wilderness among his beloved Indians and far from the zones of civilization whom we met in \\"Mohicans\\"), Natty now seems somewhat older (though not much time appears to have elapsed) and longing, at last, for what he has always eschewed: a place and family of his own. Brought to a lakeside fort (Lake Ontario) at the urging of an old friend who is in charge of running the day to day soldiering at the fort and who desires to play matchmaker between his daughter and Pathfinder, Natty soon finds himself in the midst of intrigue and betrayal on the lake. It is still the time of the French and Indian Wars and the action involves naval activity on the lake and in the Thousand Islands. But Natty soon finds he has competition for the hand of his old friend's daughter in the person of a young naval officer who promptly falls under suspicion because of his French origins. In the end, Pathfinder must get to the bottom of the betrayal while making the noble choice with regard to the fair maiden and his rival for her hand. The action involves a swift \\"sea\\" chase over Ontario and a denoument among the Thousand Islands as Pathfinder and his faithful companion, Chingachgook, seek to protect the small military force in their charge from a French attack which is aided by unknown turncoats in their midst. It's a good story but less powerful, and a good deal more wooden, than \\"Mohicans\\". Natty, himself, seems a might too talkative for the strong silent type he is alleged to be (didn't seem as problematic in the earlier \\"Mohicans\\" as it does here), but there are some good moments including an opening scene where the great forested country is vividly depicted, a fine shooting match at the fort (reminiscent of Scott's knightly tourneys), an exciting chase across the face of the lake and a fine wrap-up when Pathfinder struggles to save the outgunned outpost in his charge. Still this one read better when I was much younger than it does today.Stuart W. Mirskyauthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Pathfinder","review":"I originally wanted to read the Last of the Mohicans because of the very enjoyable movie but I picked up this book and chose to read it first. I do not regret my decision. I was unaware when I began reading this book in the Leatherstocking series that it was not the first book in the series. A reader who has not read other books in the series can feel confident that they won't feel lost if they start reading this book. The book portrays very detailed images of the forests, lakes, rivers, and people of the French and Indian War time period during the 18th century. The character development and plot are very well done. The book also gives a glimpse of the harsh realities of war during this time period. The writing style of the book is also fascinating and reminds me, at times, of epic poetry. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pathfinder","review":"In this, the third Leatherstocking tale chronologically (after Deerslayer and Last of the Mohicans), James Fenimore Cooper takes us, once again, to his vision of pure, unadultered, nature. Once again he weaves a tale around his ideas of morality, race, and religion. This time around Leatherstocking (known here as Pathfinder) is the pursuer of love, whereas before (in Deerslayer) he was the pursued.These three books are the only ones that I have read to this point, and it is true that both this and the Deerslayer are more of romances than the Last of the Mohicans, which is an adventure.Alot of people give the other books in the series flack because they are expecting the same as what they read in Last of the Mohicans. However, if you begin reading the book without those preconcived notions leading to disappointment, I think you will find that the other books are equally entertainingAll three are great books and I highly recommend them all."},{"Title":"Pathfinder","review":"Chronologically speaking, this is the sequal to Last of the Mohicans, though not written in that order. Pathfinder returns us to the Seven Years War in colonial times. A great book, Pathfinder is probably Cooper's most romantic book in its depictions of upstate New York, the most modern of his writing capabilities, and the most active in its depiction of war. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pathfinder","review":"In the fourth installment of the Leatherstocking Tales, Cooper introduces a nautical theme upon the surface and along the shores of Lake Ontario. The Pathfinder is ultimately a love story tinged with the conspiracy of treason, though it takes no extra-sensory perception to uncover the traitor long before he is exposed in the book. Cap, a grizzled saltwater veteran, accompanies his niece to visit her father stationed at the British outpost of Fort Oswego, NY. Once there, the two become embroiled in the confrontation between England, France, and their Native American allies for control of the lake. Cap is dismissive of landlubbers and \\"freshwater ponds\\", such as he describes Ontario, setting the stage for his mind to be turned by the derring-do of inland waterman, Jasper Western. Indeed, Cap is so outspoken in his contempt for the ways of his new found associates, that he becomes somewhat of an annoyance to the reader. Cooper chose to give the character little in the way of redeeming qualities nearly spoiling the pleasure one takes in Cap's ultimate and grudging respect for the wilderness and the men who master it. Such a thoroughly boorish character simply creates no emotional connection. But, Cap isn't guilty of treason. You'll spot the traitor shortly after he appears.The Pathfinder is formulaic, utterly predictable, and, at times, almost childlike in substance, but throughout, as in all other Leatherstocking Tales, radiates the simple goodness, manly deportment, and rustic charm of Nathaniel Bumppo. Indeed, Bumppo as a character is so masterfully wrought that Cooper could place him in a melon patch for the duration of a book and still manage to eke out a classic. Having previously read The Pioneers, The Last of the Mohicans, and The Prairie, I find The Pathfinder the weaker of the four, but fourth in favor in this wonderful series of stories isn't any black mark. Indeed, it qualifies The Pathfinder as yet another loveable yarn from the pen of James Fenimore Cooper. 4+ stars."},{"Title":"Pathfinder","review":"The third book (chronologically) in the Leatherstocking series was, like 'The Deerslayer,' written late in Cooper's career. Timewise, 'The Pathfinder' appears to take place only a few years after 'The Last of the Mohicans,' although Cooper's overt chronology doesn't quite add up.Although 'The Pathfinder' has a promising premise, Cooper's plotting is seriously off-track. After rescuing this novel's 'heroine' (Mabel) from the Mingos, Chingachgook vanishes and Natty is stuck playing a rather awkward suitor to Mabel. In fact, one can hardly call 'The Pathfinder' a frontier adventure at all. It verges on a romance novel, which instantly makes it much less interesting than the other Leatherstocking Tales.The book is also hurt by slow pacing. Cooper always takes his sweet 'ole time spinning a yarn, but 'The Pathfinder' is a painfully slow read. Not much happens, and what does happen is pretty irrelevant to the plot. For example, the long sequence where the 'Scud' sails around Lake Ontario contributes nothing to the story. Even worse, I always knew exactly where the story was going dozens of pages before Cooper got there. One hundred pages could easily have been chopped from this book without losing a thing.Even when the action finally picks up late in the book, Natty and Chingachgook do next to nothing. Instead, the heroism is handled by the underdrawn character of Jasper Western. It doesn't help that Cooper sets up the final battle by having Mabel's father leave her alone in a fort with an unscupulous suitor and practically no soldiers for protections. It's so unbelieveable that the rest of the novel seems forced.Least palatable is Cooper's unfortunate weakness for melodrama. Sometimes his plots are strong enough to render this only an annoying flaw, but the plot of 'The Patherfinder' is too thin to manage this. Cooper really lays on some dreadful schlock.As a result, 'The Pathfinder' is without question the weakest of the Leatherstocking Tales, and is definitely NOT the place to start. In fact, I'm hard pressed to come up with anything the novel contributes to the series. As a result, it should be read last (if at all) unless you are determined to read all five books."},{"Title":"Pathfinder","review":"James Fennimore Cooper's five books known as \\"The Leatherstocking Tales\\" ( the Pathfinder is the third in the series) are some of the most exciting books I've ever read.

Butwhat Cooper does in his tale, The Pathfinder, is give a brilliantimage of the first rude settlements in North America, referring tothe story as our legend. If he did invent, it was in termsof what he actually had learned during a visit to a region of thecountry.The underlying motive of his novel, from beginning to end,was to move and capture the reader by what he once identifiedas a &quot;stoicism which (Pathfinder) imbibed from long associationwith the Indians.&quot; This is a naturally compact dependent clausefor a concept of philosophical submission, and Cooper's observationof its existence cunningly changed many times in the unfoldmentof his story,- mostly in the direction that wouldawaken those who were practised in the ways of the world.At the heart of the observation, nevertheless, the interpreter canmonotonously perceive the play of three observable realities:position; time; and the quantities, such as energy and growth,that are attributed to them.The first of the plotting instruments, conspicuously a solitarysign with Cooper and his characters is the bearing of position.Once place, environment, is known, the sergeant tells another character,'it will be something gained to learn our position.' Unlessyou have it, the place will be too dark to reveal the color ofnature's pristine appearance. Like the woodsman's, the reader'spatience is a virtue as he changes position.

The book clearly explained how Scotland adapted the highly touted Swiss military system without understanding why it was so highly regarded. So while on paper, the Scots held all the advantages, there were many weaknesses within that army that led to its destruction.One of the better books written about this battle which not much have been written about. I almost expected to see Osprey comes out with a title from their campaign series but I was glad to read this book which proves to be so well written. Easy enough for casual readers and good enough for serious student."},{"Title":"Flodden (Revealing History)","review":"If the battle of Bannockburn represents Scotland's greatest victory against the English then Flodden represents its worst defeat. On September 9, 1513, a Scottish army under the command of their king, James IV, was utterly crushed by an English army under the command of the Earl of Surrey. In the appalling close quarter combat, King James, most of the Scottish nobility, and maybe up to 8,000 Scottish solders were slain. With James IV dead, his infant son became king which brought all the internal struggles and internecine violence that accompanies a kingdom run by regents. Scotland, which before the battle had been emerging as a real player in European politics, never recovered from this catastrophe.The most interesting facet of author Niall Barr's book is that the Scot's seemingly had all the advantages. The army James IV led over the English border in 1513 was probably the largest (btw 30-40,000 men) and the best equipped (it had a large train of siege artillery and most of its men were armed with 18ft long pikes- the weapon which had helped make Swiss armies almost invincible on continental battlefields) that Scotland had ever fielded. The Scots had also adopted Swiss tactics- phalanx-like pike formations attacking in echelon. The English army that faced them was smaller in size (around 26,000 men), had only light field guns, and most of its men were armed with weapons that were considered obsolescent in the early 16th century, the bill and the longbow. James was also able to draw the English army into battle on ground of his own choosing- a hill upon which his pikemen could charge down and literally overrun their opponents. Thus, the Scots had advantages in numbers, artillery, position, and were using the most modern weapons and tactics of the day. Yet, it was the Scots who were slaughtered. How did this happen?Barr believes that from a strategic and operational standpoint James IV did everything right. This is contrary to Scottish tradition which portrays James as a frivolous and unrealistic man who blundered his country into war and then botched the campaign. Barr discounts these judgements and makes a strong case that James was actually very level-headed in invading England in 1513 (at the time the English king, Henry VIII, was in France with his best troops) and that he also made good decisions on the campaign. However, Barr believes the Scottish defeat at Flodden was because of poor tactical theory. The Scots quite simply were carrying the wrong sort of weapons and fighting with the wrong sort of tactics.Barr spends an entire chapter focusing on the Swiss military system of the early 16th century and explains why it was the envy of Europe. Thus, he lays the groundwork to show why that system failed the Scots so badly at Flodden. Swiss armies were renowned for their discipline, training, and high morale which enabled their pike formations to retain their cohesion. This cohesion was vital to their success. The Scottish army at Flodden was a feudal levy with minimal training, little discipline, and brittle morale. When, because of a lack of training, the Scottish pike formations lost their cohesion the English were able to rush in among them. In close quarters, a Scot armed with an 18ft long pike was at a huge disadvantage against Englishman carrying an 8ft bill. Even then disaster could have been averted if the Scots had copied the Swiss combined arms approach to combat. The Swiss did not entirely rely on pikemen, but instead had sizeable formations of halberdiers, crossbowmen, and handgunners to break-up enemy formations and engage in close quarter combat. But before Flodden, the Scots had decided to live (and thus die) with the pike alone.Barr's analysis and detail is fascinating. He dedicates an entire chapter to describing the first artillery duel in British military history which the English won and caused the Scots to abandon their strong position. He also explains why the Scottish nobility suffered such horrendous losses- a rarity even for a late medieval battle. Overall, this an extremely well-written account of a battle that is virtually unknown outside the U.K which is surprising considering its size and the devastating effect on the loser."},{"Title":"Children's Songs for Beginning Guitar Book/CD (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar)","review":"I'm very much a beginning guitarist and this book is well within my range.

Anyone interested in the phenomenon of whiplash injuries should avoid this shallow book.Allen wrote an article for the journal SPINE (1995) discussing accelerations in low-speed automobile collisions and compared them to everyday benign activities such as skipping rope and plopping into chairs. He postulated that injuries were not possible and that injury cannot exist at low speeds.Unfortunately for Dr. Allen, that article has been debunked in academic circles in medicine and engineering. The article is an example of what happens when you have medical editors reviewing articles about physics: they haven't got a clue.Allen failed to understand the physics of whiplash by looking at the short bursts of acceleration caused by plopping into chairs and skipping rope. TWO factors must be present to determine the injury potential in whiplash accidents: acceleration AND delta V. Plopping, etc. have accelerations APPROACHING those of whiplash at low speeds (still not quite as high, Dr. Allen), but THERE IS NO DELTA V. Car crashes happen over several HUNDRED milliseconds, and in spite of Allen's use of language devised to confuse, his rope-skippng and chair-plopping delta V's are on the order of magnitude of only TENS of milliseconds. And that is a critical difference.Allen also ignored the fact that vehicles weigh 2500 lbs. and more, that today's cars are HEAVIER (not lighter, as he implies) than the vintage World War II cars he talks about (Severy et al. research). Since in PHYSICS, Force equals Mass times Acceleration, or F = ma, Allen ignores the force of a 2500 lb. object hitting you versus a 50-85 lb. child hitting a chair or the ground (in cushioned sneakers no less). In addition, the epidemiological literature on whiplash is massive. Does he really think that whiplash doesn't exist at low speeds? Is the emergency room filled with rope-skippers and chair-ploppers? Are ALL of the people injured in collisions at low speeds faking? Why is it that several outcome studies show long-term disability and chronic pain YEARS AFTER the lawsuits are settled? Epidemiology proves that most injuries occur at speeds of 6-12 mph, whereas vehicle damage thresholds are higher. Doesn't Dr. Allen know anything about the physics of plastic (deformation and damage to vehicles) vs. elastic collisions (low-speed collisions where the damage from the energy of collision is transferred to the vehicle OCCUPANTS)? His &quot;perturbations&quot; study was TOTALLY BOGUS, and certainly naive.And that means that Allen is one of two things: grossly undereducated in physics, biomechanics and the medicine of whiplash...or, perhaps was romancing the auto insurance industry who would love nothing more than to continue denying claims for real injuries. Take your pick. He is NOT TO BE TRUSTED.Further, Allen claimed in that article that Severy found no injuries in his crash tests at UCLA in the 1950's. Did he even read Severy? A closer look at Dr. Allen's past writings will reveal that he draws conclusions from his own studies on whiplash he has no business drawing. That an article as weak as &quot;Perturbations&quot; could ever be published is a testament to journal editors' need to SELL journals, and to sell controversy with JUNK SCIENCE. If Allen has ever gone to court as an expert witness and used his article, he should realize that many physicists, hard scientists, medical professionals and whiplash victims are on to him.I urge all whiplash sufferers to read the scientific literature on low-speed crash testing, especially works by Ono, Kanno, Panjabi, Brault, Siegmund, Croft, Freeman, and the many other real scientists who are telling the truth about whiplash. Injuries start at rear-end collision speeds of 2.5 mph. Surprised? The truth is in the literature.You will not find the truth in Allen's book. Is he a lacky-boy for the defense attorneys who represent the insurance industry, or the industry itself? Is greed at the heart of such writing? One has to wonder.I hope Dr. Allen reads this and changes his ways, if he hasn't since that AWFUL 1995 article. Otherwise, he might find himself a patient with injuries sustained in a low-speed rear-end collision with no one to empathize, and unable to sleep at night. In fact, I don't know how he can sleep now.This book is no help to the millions of innocent victims of car crashes. The ideas in this book about whiplash are truly superficial. This book and the one by Ferrari are misusing the literature to fool people, and to help the auto insurance industry and their representatives. There is no reality here, just another perturbation of the truth."},{"Title":"Musculoskeletal Pain Emanating From the Head and Neck: Current Concepts in Diagnosis, Management, and Cost Containment","review":"Having treated numerous whiplash victims, and having gone against numerous insurance companies, I am continually amazed at the defense's reliance on Dr. Allen's 'Pertubations' article from Spine.

Sorry.Came across a Max Klinger exhibition when I was still a teenager when I was visiting Tokyo. His etchings have fascinated me since then, possessing at once an ethereal and surrealistic quality, against the backdrop of everyday life. The cover of this book is a perfect example: what is a scene at a early century skating rink Klinger frozed a moment where the viewer is temporarily disconcerted by the absurdity of the movements of the people in the picture. This &quot;perfect imbalance&quot; permeates through most of his other works.15 years on, with the advent of internet technology, and emergence of sites like google, I tried again to revisit this great artist. A comtemporary of Klimt, with whom he collaborated on some occasions, he was nonetheless driven back into undeserved obscurity.Klinger made, at his peak a prolific graphic artist and able sculpter, subtle but provoking art."},{"Title":"Graphic Works of Max Klinger (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"Every so often you stumble upon an artist you never knew existed, only to wonder how such marvelous work could remain largely forgotten & unknown. That's the case with Max Klinger, whose graphic works clearly prefigure the Surrealists, and who is happily acknowledged by many of them.At first these images seem all too familiar: somewhat Victorian, with traditional Classical motifs ... until you begin to realize that there's something just slightly askew about them, something off-kilter, even if you can't quite put your finger on it. There's an unsettling dreamlike quality to them, a logic that veers off in its own direction. And then the disturbing psycho-sexual elements begin to emerge from the mundane absurdity, creating a startling & somewhat bizarre beauty that makes its own sense.For anyone who loves the Symbolists & the Surrealists, Klinger is a shadowy link between them. There's a subtle freshness to his work that delights the eye & stirs the imagination. Highly trecommended!"},{"Title":"Graphic Works of Max Klinger (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"As I like quality-comics, I like Klinger. Every picture tells a story.

These &quot;devotions&quot; are culled from Martin Luther's many solid writings and sermons. Martin Luther's insights into life are startling in their depth and honesty, even 500 years later. His Biblical interpretations always keep Christ at the center and focus, and it's amazing how enriching are his comments. One of my parishioners was dumbfounded at how one of Luther's meditations spoke to exactly her current problems. I have also found it applicable to my life, and am continually coming back for more of the comfort his words carry.For those of you who follow the church year, this resource is even better. It is layed out in the format of the weeks of the church year. When applicable, the weeks use the Latin name taken from the collect of the day. So the weeks in Lent are the traditional ones like Misericordia Domini or Oculi. Likewise, the weeks in Easter. But even if you are not used to the church year, this layout is easier to follow through then it sounds.Another feature of this devotional book is that it includes a Christian hymn verse that fits each meditation for devotional use, and encourages other Scripture reading and prayers.This is one of the finest. I hope the publisher will try to reprint it. Every Christian needs this book."},{"Title":"Management Innovators: The People and Ideas that Have Shaped Modern Business","review":"Every manager should read this illuminating and extremely important book. Daniel A.Wren and Ronald G.Greenwood give tomorrow's leaders indispensable lessons from 'the people and ideas that have shaped modern business.'They write that &quot;our goal is to portray a selection of individuals whose ideas have made a difference in the way we teach and practice business management. In selecting these figures, we realize that it would be impossible to chronicle all of their activities; we could have chosen other individuals of equal stature as well. We have kept in mind an audience of contemporary managers, aspiring managers, and students of management who wish to gain a historical perspective on their profession by sketching the people and ideas that contributed to the formation of modern management&quot; (from the Preface).In this context, Wren and Greenwood divide their book into two parts:* Part One- In this part, they trace the beginnings of American enterprise in inventing, manufacturing, selling, transportation, communication, and financing. They argue that these fourteen individuals set a pattern for others to follow as U.S. business enterprise grew.* Part Two- In this part, in order to portray the search for better ways to manage, they present stories of other influential individuals. Here, they argue that these representatives played a pioneering role in shaping modern managerial practices.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Management Innovators: The People and Ideas that Have Shaped Modern Business","review":"Wren and Greenwood have written one of the most informative I have read in recent years. With brevity but precision and insight, they examine 30 people who have indeed \\"shaped modern business.\\" The excellent material is presented within 12 chapters which range from \\"Inventors\\" (Eli Whitney and Thomas Alva Edison) to \\"Guru\\" (peter F. Drucker).. Along the way, they discuss a number of especially influential persons about whom many readers probably know little (if anything), such as Alexander T. Stewart, James J. Hill, Ezra Cornell, Lillian and Frank Gilbreth, Chester I. Barnard, and Mary Parker Follett.All by itself, the Introduction is well worth the cost of the book. Near its conclusion, Wren and Greenwood observe: \\"Taken as a whole, there is no single theme to this book; rather, it is a narrative with multiple themes as a story of American business enterprise unfolds. Beginning with the selection of inventors, we see how the process of invention and innovation changes the way we live, creates entirely new industries, and must be continuous as the competitive environment changes. Makers [e.g. Henry Ford] are those who who change ideas into markets for the marketplace -- an evolutionary process that accompanies the shift from small-to-large-scale manufacturing and then to the assembly line. Sellers [e.g. Richard W. Sears] take those products to market and allow us to see the sales and distribution innovations that have enabled modern consumers to live better than the monarchs of centuries before. Inventors, makers, and sellers need the movers [e.g. Edward H. Harriman], those who create the time and place utility; and all need the communicators [e.g. Alexander Graham Bell], who connect the parts into a whole.\\"Because this book was first published in 1998, many readers (I among them) would have expected the inclusion of other \\"management innovators\\" such as Donald Dell, Walt Disney, Bill Gates, Sam Walton, and Jack Welch. Perhaps they will be among those discussed in a sequel to this volume. Nonetheless, each of the 30 whom Wren and Greenwood do include is eminently worthy. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Stuart Crainer's The Management Century, James Tobin's Great Projects: The Epic Story of the Building of America, from the Taming of the Mississippi to the Invention of the Internet, and Andrea Gabor's The Capitalist Philosophers: The Geniuses of Modern Business -- Their Lives, Times, and Ideas."},{"Title":"Management Innovators: The People and Ideas that Have Shaped Modern Business","review":"Selection of the people and ideas that have shaped business marginal.

Arywn, the beautiful herione chosen to defeat the bad guy to save the world, Gareth, the cycloptic narrator, Kreeg, Arwyn's faithful poochie, Mordath, Skeletor's first cousin [not really], and Neven, the mysterious mage all return as the hunt continues to track down the shards of Aiden's arrow.Without giving too much away, volume 2 focuses on the attempt to retrieve of the first shard and an encounter with a very unusual dragon. There is more character development for Arwyn and Gareth, and we are left just as confused regarding Neven's role. And Kreeg goes \\"woof\\".What sets Sojourn apart from other series' (in my opinion) is the role of Gareth. He is a narrator, a commentator, and a main character. Whereas Arwyn is rather tactid (is that a word?), we constantly hear Gareth's thoughts and opinions, but not so often that it gets annoying. Arywn's character is also phenominal since she is a strong herione with an unpleasant past who doesn't really want the arrow to save the world, but to avenge the death of her son and husband.If you liked book one, you'll love book two just as much.

Thankfully most of the book is drawn by Greg Land. I was on familiar territory again when I reached Chapter 2. The last chapter is a complete letdown because it too has a different artist, so again you feel that Arwyn and Gareth have disappeared and have been replaced by doubles -- and not very good ones at that.

The characters all seem to be drawn with porn stars as the models--the women are big-chested and preternaturally beautiful; the guys are all long-haired and unshaven. You're supposed to really feel for the heroine and her desire for revenge on the evil sorcerer who killed her family but it's really just tiresome and cliched.

In some cases, both descriptions are true! So, naturally you run out of the bookstore screaming in fear at the prospect of conquering all those pages. Well, here's your solution... if you're open to or already familiar with the comics medium, pick up the first two volumes of CrossGen's epic &quot;Sojourn&quot; graphic novel series. This volume, plus volume 1 (&quot;From the Ashes&quot;) together collect the first 12 issues of this terrific fantasy series, and the story so far gives you the type of drama, wonder, adventure, and humor you experienced in Peter Jackson's films (though with its own personality and flavor), but without the time commitment, fuss, and... well, drudgery, of having to wade through a four-pound doorstop of a book (or two, or three, or... you get the picture). Instead of getting your weightiness from the literal weight of the book, you'll get it from the epic goings-on, courtesy of Ron Marz's entertaining writing, and from Greg Land's wonderfully detailed artwork. And for those of you who don't mind a nice, thick book, and even like 'em, don't worry, you do get well over a hundred pages in each of these first two volumes, plenty of pages to let you get good and immersed in the story.

This historical perspective is long overdue. Since media development is actually the story of societal development, author Paul Starr does a tremendous job of detailing the roles of such diverse factors as innovation, invention, patronage, luck, law and competition, all of which shaped the media's development and helped determine its ultimate societal impact. This book is refreshingly light on political criticism, so each set of facts stands on its own. While Starr occasionally meanders from the main topic, the book's rich detail shows that he clearly enjoyed his research and writing. We consider his book essential reading for anyone interested in new and old media and how they were - and are - influenced by their societies."},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","review":"This is by far the most exhaustive reading on the creation, growth, and perpetuation of media I have ever read.At the outset, this is not a light read. Laced with history, the sociology of people within history, and trends operating in American and European culture, this is for serious students of both history and media. For that crowd, it will be a very pleasant read.I give high praise to Paul Starr for being able to outline not only the growth of media and opinion, but also putting the growth in light of America's capitalistism and industrial strength.He starts out by analyzing how European Nations like France and England tried to promote literacy through newsprint and postal services. He then outlines how those measures spilled into the United States during the Colonial Period.Of course, newspapers were only the tip of the iceberg. Starr carefully analyzes how new inventions like the telephone, telegraph, film, and radio were used heavily for capitalistic gain as well as entertainment. At first, the U.S. Supreme Court was reticent to recognize First Amendment protection to these new mediums.He also compares and contrasts Europe's tendency to nationalize many inventions instead of letting the market allow inventors to make money on their projects. Meticulously, he shows how the U.S. Navy tried to squelch Marconi's patent for wireless radio, and eventually how the Radio Act of 1927 preserved both the national and private interest.In the end, Starr seems to point out that American Capitalism was instrumental not only in creating the media, but also allowing it to diversify and eventually find the same protection as print media--and eventually find a huge diversification in points of view.Of course, all along he finds the naysayers like the Catholic League, the Hayes Code, and the Book Publishers Code that operated out of a fear of the public who did not trust these new medias.Starr is a talented writer of history and can bring the elements related to new medias with such deft and articulation. He keeps the attention, occassionaly straying from the subject, but returning before interest is lost. Moreover, he does real well in keeping his own biases and prejudices aside, simply telling history instead of trying to interpret everything as either a conservative backlash, or a liberal trick.Kudos to Starr. I look forward to his future endeavors."},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","review":"Paul Starr examines the development of communication in America and how it caused American democracy to develop differently from European powers.Starr lays out the argument \\"that the United States has followed a distinctive developmental path in communications ever since the American Revolution. The origins of that path lie in the country's founding as a liberal republic and its response to the peculiar challenges of building a nation on a continental scale.\\" (pg. 2) Starr sees the role of communications, especially newspapers and the way the Post Office was used to subsidize the press along with the restraint in state authority as the key to place the United States on a course that sharply diverged from the patterns in Britain and the rest of Europe. Newspapers played an important part in the development of the United States. American papers focused on news with political commentary added for color while European papers focused more on literary essays. This made newspapers more popular with the masses in America. From this beginning, Starr continues to follow the development of film, radio and TV along with the recent growth in the Internet. In almost all cases, the major inventions or improvements in communications occured in the U.S. The role of a large educated middle class and the ability to communicate have for Starr resulted in our liberal form of democracy.Read this along with Michael Linds \\"The American Way of Strategy\\" to gain a new perspective of why the United States is currently involved in Iraq and Afghanistan."},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","review":"I thought I knew a fair amount of American history but I learned a great deal from this book. The scope is huge ranging from the colonial period until World War II and also international in that comparisons with Britain and to a lesser degree France and Germany are constant. I will admit that the book's thesis, that political decisions, have enormous impacts and that the development of media (and industry in general) would have been impossible with government, is something I am inherently sympathetic toward.A very minor critique on writing style is that smaller paragraphs would have been helpful. But this is a tiny criticism of a great book."},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","review":"Starr's history of the \\"developmental path\\" of communications in the US offers a quiet but significant argument about the role of the state. He argues--on sound empirical and comparative grounds--that the major media forms in the US were shaped by distinctive political decisions made by the state. As a result, American media and media industries didn't follow the same historical path that shaped the media in European nations. But Starr is not making an argument for \\"American exceptionalism\\" in any crude or ideological sense. Yes, Starr clearly thinks the US has more successfully nurtured a robust public sphere (at least before WW II), and that its path of development has given it certain advantages in the global marketplace. But he is far from merely telling a triumphant story of American enterprise. Instead, he gives detailed historical evidence that will refute any jingoistic claim that private property interests and free market ideology are the key to US success.On the other hand, Starr argues, the very success of US media have also produced what Starr calls an \\"American dilemma\\": while democratic ideas helped create new media, those media have become vast industries with enormous power--power that has the potential to erode the very democratic practices and spaces (discussion, access, association, diversity) that brought them into existence.Starr's arguments unfold quietly and across the different chapters. This is not a bald polemic. But I would identify two key arguments that emerge (neither of which will easily comport with the right or the left):1. Commercial activity has always been part of the public sphere of mediated discussion, expression, and political debate. There is no pure, disinterested space of political speech; from the earliest newspapers and pamphlets to highly capitalized broadcasting, the search for profit has been part of what spurred innovation, expanded public discussions, and sparked competitive contests. While this links public speech to interests and ideology, it can also allow multiple perspectives and represent the interests of less powerful groups--although the interests of capital and ruling elites do try to dominate. (Free market types will like this thread in Starr's book, while more left-leaning thinkers may not.)2. While private and commercial interests have be part of the successful creation of media in the US, from the first it has been the state that has been the key the US competitive advantage. By supporting free speech in law, low taxation on print, broad access to education (in the North, though not in the South), infrastructure of roads, post offices, and postal rates, and by (sometimes) keeping monopolies from chocking off innovation, the state has been crucial to US success. It is a glaring mistake to assume that a hands-off government is the reason the US has succeeded so well in fostering high literacy (with damning exceptions like the exclusion of African Americans from access to education, even after abolition), technological innovation, and media industries like sound and cinema that have been adopted around the globe. (More left-oriented types will applaud this part of the book.)Note that Starr ends his history in the 1940s, right as the most pressing questions of the power of media industries and public relations begin to worry a lot of people. He doesn't down play these worries. But he does think they are inevitable \\"tensions\\" that can't be eliminated--though they should be carefully examined and deliberated. Starr's history is an excellent synthetic account that is very helpful for taking up just those problems."},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","review":"Great subject; poor execution. Starr is so determined to prove his point that people have the capacity to determine their historical decisions that he forces the facts of his arugment to fit his theory. There are some perfect moments of pure contradiction here. My favorite is the chapter on radio, where he concedes that maybe the technical limitations of media determines the process of their deployment in society, only to dismiss it with an offhand, \\"of course that can't be the case.\\" The book is also hobbled by a limp wrist embrace of American exceptionalism, as though the geographic, social and class context of America weren't enough to account for difference between the deployment of technology in America and Europe. No, it HAS to be the genius of our political institutions. There are at least three great stories here: How the aesthetic conventions of media determine historical consicousness (a la McLuhan), the role of media in price revolutions, and how media is used as a tool in class and ethnic competition. But Starr misses all of them either because he has an agenda when he gets to the facts, or because doing political history is easy, and economic history hard. Either way, lame. For bourgeois historians only. If you're a media professional, pass."},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","review":"I read this book for a History of Mass Media class at the University of Pittsburgh during the fall semester of 2009. We had to do class presentations from the chapters in the book. One of the points that the class had to present on was the strengths and weaknesses of the chapters. Every week the class said the same thing. That Paul Starr doesn't order his information chronologically, he doesn't give good enough examples, he jumps from one time period to the next within the same paragraphs, he also jumps form Europe to America without telling us that he does it. He just writes as if he knows the information like its the back of his hand, he doesn't have skill in explaining ordinary concepts in a clear and concise way. It seems as if he writes too academically, he should just write to explain his concepts and the history instead of going off on tangents. Also he frequently goes off topic. The book covers the Mass Media systems of the U.S. and Europe. He starts with the newspapers and the post office then goes to books, next is the telegraph, then the telephone, next is the radio then movies. He barely mentions the Television in the book.My overall review of this book is that it is horrible. I would not reccomend it to any professor to teach from. My professor even gave the class her notes of the book every week because she thought that it was a tough read. I also wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who would like it for just plain reading. Alot of books help you think critically, this book doesn't help you think critically or abstractly, it just leaves you plain confused. You will be frustrated at the end. All of my classmates agreed that this was a horrible book for a class text."},{"Title":"Organizing Successful Tournaments-2nd Edition","review":"Organizing Successful Tournaments is a great book for any budding tournament organizers or directors to build a library upon. John Byl does a very nice job of defining and discussing the various types of tournament, and how each one may or may not apply to the needs of the organizers. Included worksheets make this job even more simplistic and go a long way towards making the tasks of the tournament director less stressful. If there is any area that this book did not cover it would be that Mr. Byl focused mainly upon sporting tournaments instead of also including more game oriented events, such as cards, chess and the like. However, the tips, information, planning and worksheets make this book appicible to almost all events with very little alteration. A very nice job, and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Organizing Successful Tournaments-2nd Edition","review":"Very handy source for competition planning.

It's well written and humorous!"},{"Title":"The Deluge Story in Stone","review":"This book by Byron Nelson was originally published in 1927, and it and its companion volumeAfters Its Kindwere very influential upon later creationists such as Henry Morris and John Whitcomb.Nelson wrote in the Preface to this 1931 book, \\"(the author) was compelled in ('After Its Kind'), by lack of space, to discuss one phase of the subject more briefly than he desired... The author would have liked to present more complete evidences of the Flood as the cause of the fossiliferous strata than he was able to do in the space available. He resolved, however, to satisfy his desire ... by writing a separate book dealing only with that subject. That book, a companion to 'After Its Kind,' the writer is presenting to the Church in 'The Deluge Story in Stone.'\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"It would be folly indeed to maintain a Flood theory of geology, if the Bible did not countenance such a theory.\\" (Pg. 1)\\"The manner of their entombment tells an instructive story... It can hardly be thought that these fish are in their native habitat, or died naturally where they bred and flourished, as uniformitarian geologists maintain regarding shells that are found in the strata. Only some catastrophe of the nature of the Flood can satisfactorily explain their mode of burial.\\" (Pg. 42)\\"...for no other reason than that the strata are in the wrong order, on the basis of a supposed organic evolution, the strata are said to have reversed themselves.\\" (Pg. 146)\\"According to the sacred record, the purpose of the Flood was to punish and destroy men. The question is asked, Where are the fossils of these men? Why are they not discovered as are the relics of prediluvian plants and animals? To this objection various answers have been given: ... It was God's deliberate purpose to leave no vestige of prediluvian man remaining.\\" (Pg. 161)\\"Assuming the Biblical record to be correct, the general similarity between the widely scattered accounts (of the Flood) is readily accounted for. The only alternative to the theory that there was one single flood catastrophe, universal as far as the human race is concerned, which is the basis for all of the Deluge legends, is that there were many separate local floods each of which is the basis of a different flood account. This alternative has this chief objection: namely, that the remarkable similarity in the Deluge legends is not accounted for.\\" (Pg. 166-167)"},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"This book presents notes from a summit of several top thinkers in the fields of psychoanalysis, neurophysiology, Buddhism, Western philosophy and others. Completely unlike a collection of essays; you're presented with the rich, dynamic and fascinating syntheses of the theories from each of these fields. The dialog format emphasizes the creativity and intelligence of participants. Worth reading no matter which philosphy you endorse -- all the better if you have some interest in each! This book has that rare quality of really making you work your brain muscle AND being a book you can't wait to come home to after work. Don't skip a page"},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"Can you imagine a conversation about the essence of art taking place between, oh, say, Picasso and art therapists who treat mental patients, and some chemists who concoct formulaes for oil paints? Something like that is taking place here. The title alone is enough to pique your interest, but the content is less than secret-divulging. If you're not a neurologist,or a specialist in a related area,then much of the material presented by the neurologist will be for all practical purposes useless. If you're not familiar with the basic assumptions of esoteric buddhist psychology, then much of what HH Dalai Lama has to say will sound like so much dogma or articles of faith. I know next to nothing about brain sciences, but am academically acquainted with the buddhist conception of reality, so I found what the Dalai Lama had to say both interesting and amusing. Interesting, because he speaks as plainly as he can about things that are usually wrapped in some hairy buddhist language. Amusing, becuase the Dalai Lama would show utmost courtesy in listening to all the dry academic presentations, which even I found somewhat tedious, and then offer his views about the matter at hand by often beginning with what sounds like a gentle correction rather than a positing of difference of perspective only. I paraphrase from memory: &quot;Well, your numbers and theories are all very nice, but no, it's actually like this.&quot; Some of the discussions on REM, and animal responses to dream states are interesting, but just merely interesting. Better on the Discovery channel. Much of the philosopher Charles Taylor's presentations concerning the Western/Christian conception of the Self is reliable but elementary. And dealing with the subject matter at hand, even an eminent philosopher can do only so much with Ratio alone. The book is of some value if one is willing to be open to the possibility that the Dalai Lama may be speaking of things that are real but not measurable, at least not with knobs and dials. Not yet. He never mentions it specifically in the book, but the idea of rebirth and the attendant conditions are indirectly there, for example when he questions the authenticity of the phenomenon of seeing one's departed ones in a near-death experience. He says, &quot;Maybe the person is hallucinating at that point or projecting a wish. They (the loved ones who departed long ago) would have found new bodies by then.&quot; Taken as an record of an encounter with the Dalai Lama, this book sheds some light into that aspect of the man that won't show up when he is on Larry King or speaking of compassion to the multitude in Central Park. The guy is a professional in his own field, after all, and he knows his chops. Here, refreshingly enough, he sheds some of his avuncular &quot;hey, be cool, people!&quot; image and divulges some of his professional knowledge at a speed and intensity of delivery considerably higher than the mass media have shown him to be capable."},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"I found this book to be a little dry at times but nonetheless provides some useful explanations on the myths which have been with the human race since the ancient time: dream, sleep and death.From a buddhist perspective it helps reinforces the belief (at least not disproved it) of buddhist that there is a higher level of consciousness not yet been measured via any scientific means. From a scientific standpoint, the book has summarised the recent developments in neuroscience and showed us that there is a possibility one day both religion and science will meet face to face and one would have to change the fundamental concepts one used to hold. It could be the scientific community or the religious groups. At least HH the Dalai Lama is very open to the ideas in the book while the scientists were at times pretty &quot;close&quot; and reluctant to take a different perspective which made some of them sounded a little bit defensive."},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"I'm not sure why this book received all the bad reviews that it did (though I confess I have never given a Dalai Lama book less than a 5 start review-I love the guy!). The book is one of a plethora of transcripts of the Mind and Life Conferences held in India, this being the fourth conference in 1992. Sure the discussions are varied, and by no means is everyone simply in agreement with one another here. But the dialogue is engaging and thought provoking, and above all else, illuminating. At the conference we had philosophers, neuroscientists, psychologists, and many more; so of course we are going to get a huge spectrum of views.The cultural ecologist, Jane Halifax (whom you all may know of), had a particularly fascinating section in here on near death experiences. All the Dalai Lama did was show some uncertainty as to the validity of these claims in light of the Buddhist view of a natural death and rebirth. So what if the Dalai Lama didn't agree with her, you don't have to have agreement to have a good book! Differentiating views provide all of us more food to chew on, and then decide which works for us. It's not a matter of who had it right, but rather, \\"Does it sound right to you?\\"Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"Don't get me wrong: the Mind and Life institute is doing good and necessary work, and some of their publications I thought were excellent (e.g., The Dalai Lama at MIT) and provide some real food for thought. This book is simply not in this class, however. As the reviewer above noted (Sagan Lazar), what we have here is people who speak completely different languages (literally and figuratively) lecturing each other with little or no real 'dialogue.' There are some occasional interesting diversions, but these are very much the exception rather than the rule.The conversation on dreams, my own primary interest and field of research, is particularly disappointing. Almost the entire 'Western' section is devoted to the Freudian view! I was shocked that these speakers weren't embarrassed and ashamed to bring to the table a psychology as pauper, outmoded and frankly ridiculous as Freud's, especially when they were sharing that table with people well-acquainted with the vast, subtle Buddhist psychology. As if this were all the 'West' had to offer! The lucid dreaming section is better, but then the Tibetan Buddhist view on dreams doesn't really have anything to do with them... the Dalai Lama mostly rambles on about consciousness and self, then about 2 pages are devoted to 'dream yoga'; but even this section is mostly just platitudes and vague mentions of how diet affects dreaming. None of the very interesting and practical dream yoga advice you can find in other Tibetan works such as \\"Ancient Wisdom\\" by Gyatrul Rinpoche and translated by Alan Wallace (highly recommended).Death: again the section is mildly interesting, but 'dialogue' is conspicuously absent. With the meeting of all these 'great minds' you would expect a lot of fresh ideas and original opinions, but mostly you get a long list of terms and definitions, nothing you couldn't pick up in a textbook of medicine of Buddhist philosophy.Altogether forgettable; certainly this book doesn't stand out in the subject of sleep, dreams, or death/dying; and in an effort to combine all three it just fades into further superficiality."},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"this book covers a small conference where scientists, philosophers and the Dalai Lama have an intimate and candid dialogue. I have read a number of the Dalai Lama works. This one brings new light to his brilliance, sharp thinking, and wit. It illuminates differences between some Tibetan and Western attitudes and philosophies. Yet, it is presented not didactically, but in an interesting conversion which reveals the nuances of personalities and biases. The editor/narrator, Varela is also brilliant at capturing the essence of the conversation in an efficient manner. I highly recommend this book for anyone attempting to reconcile their beliefs in both science and Buddhism."},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"The work Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness with the Dalai Lama is from the 1992 Mind and Life Conference, sponsored by the Mind and Life Institute, an organization aimed at advancing dialogue between the contemplative traditions, primarily Buddhist, and the tradition of science. Dialogue is exactly what this work is. Divided into chapters with many subsections to help orientate the reader, the work transcribes the proceedings of the conference and thus has a conversational flow along with its natural tangents. Despite the frustration felt at times when a contributor's question remains unanswered or point unexplained, the content is absolutely gripping.Many perspectives and disciplines are represented by a plethora of acclaimed contributors from backgrounds as diverse as Tibetan Buddhist, neurology, psychology, medical anthropology, psychoanalysis, philosophy, biology, and religious studies. Some of the main topics covered include notions of the self, sleeping, dreams and the unconscious, lucid dreaming and dream yoga, near death experiences, bodily death, and the question of consciousness at death.This, as well as the other Mind and Life publications, will really appeal to those interested in modern Buddhism, Buddhism and science, and religion and science, but the work has wider appeal too as sleeping, dreaming, and dying are all common factors of the human experience. I would not recommend this for reference or in-depth research, but rather as a topical resource on the historic dialogue occurring between contemplatives and scientists, illustrating the potential for combining methods and findings in the future. This work is a topical treasure, as well as a simply stimulating read."},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"HHDL has had a lifelong interest in the intersection of buddhist thought and western science, and he has attracted many westerners to buddhism because of it.

I was constantly amazed at the intellectual clarity of the Dalai Lama's points and questions and the utter respect the scientists showed for Eastern understanding.Some years ago, I had the good fortune of doing a graduate-level independent study with one of the leaders in the field of Near Death Experiences. I suspected that though the phenomenon is not a purely physiological one, as the secular humanists would have us believe, the experiences are culturally dependent. I was simply stunned to read the Dalai Lama, with his wealth of knowledge in spritual and mind-related experiences, suspects the same.I hope this topic will be covered again in the future, and in greater depth, revealing the results of recent studies using the most modern scientific techniques.What a wonderul read!"},{"Title":"Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying: An Exploration of Consciousness","review":"Informative book.

What it lacks in depth in makes up for in scope however; I was happily surprised at how many cultures were represented in the collection. In leafing through, you may find a character or story that sparks you to investigate further.

However I have some problems with it. The first is the layout, it is set up in alphabetical order this makes it much harder to find information if you don't know the name of what you are looking for then if it was set up by mythos, for example if you wanted to know the Japanese god of fire but didn't know his name then you would have to search the entire book stopping at every Japanese looking name until you found it, also almost everything in the book is from a different language and often times have different translations (lets see did he spell that with a E, I, Y, or J ???). The second problem that I have is that the locations are very general, Babylonian, Sumerian and Assyrian myths are all labeled as Middle East. It is also incomplete; there is very little on Norris myth and almost no mention of anything from Arabia(1001 nights). Finally the book contradicts itself in more then one place, witch is to be expected to some degree when dealing with stories that are thousands of years old, it just seemed more noticeable here then in most cases."},{"Title":"Rhythms Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"Brynn Halstead, a dancing diva finds herself drawn to Simeon Storey, a jazz musician, club owner and accomplished composer. Having met briefly years before, they meet again working through their misunderstandings and begin looking forward to a possible future. When Brynn suffers a possible career ending tragedy that leaves her broken in a thousand pieces, Simeon is right there to pick up the pieces, never anticipating that trying to piece together something so fragile may further pull them apart.When I picked up this book I was in the mood for romance and that is exactly what I got. Doris Johnson created a heroine that one could empathize with and hero that every woman would want. However Ms. Johnson takes the proverbial saying \\"when it rains it pours\\" to a new level. I became a bit overwhelmed in all the obstacles faced by the characters. Nonetheless, the passion shown for their dreams and each other was infectious and the tragedy, recovery and discovery of oneself that our heroine goes through, distinguishes this from other romances that I have read. I found it enjoyable and definitely a recommendable read.

Here is a book that is excellent for one wanting to start studying more in depth the MANY attributes and works of Jesus Christ and how all of history revolves around His sovereignty. Mr. Lockyer does a great job and will get you started, expanding your mind beyond the &quot;milk&quot; theology in which so many Christians remain. But be careful.

The more you read of it, the more you want to read.Although this is a great scholarly work of immense research, it is easy to understand and a delight to devour. And you really will devour this book if you have an enquiring mind.When the plain facts appear in front of your eyes, you will keep turning the pages. All the way through this magnum opus you will encounter clear proof that Jesus truly was the promised Messiah and the very Son of God.You may be delighted to discover those things or they may infuriate you, depending on your world view. You may even choose to put it down and ignore the conclusive proofs. But... love it, loathe it, or ignore it, you won't be able to disprove a word of the contents.As someone who has read three translations of the Good Book from cover to cover, and dipped into all of its books in various other translations over the last thirty years, it surprises me that I didn't see those proofs before. On reading this real treasure of a book, you'll be surprised too at how you've overlooked the proofs--providing you're familiar with Scripture.Herbert Lockyer is not only to be commended for this great work, he is also to be commended for it's readability.\\"All the Messianic Prophecies of the Bible\\" proves five things conclusively, viz., 1. That the Bible is a unique book with which no other can be compared or ever will be; 2. That there has never been another human being as unique and wonderful as Jesus Christ nor ever will be; 3. The irrefutable veracity of the Bible; 4. That the Bible is Divinely inspired; and, 5. that there is a God.The very facts in this book mock and confute atheism.It's difficult not to pick this book up and be awed--at least for those who think as I do. I have to ask, albeit rhetorically, why this is not pushed in our schools and colleges? But there again, neither is an even greater book, the Bible itself. Besides, there are vast battalions of liberals and ecumenists out there who don't want either book pushed. After all, Lockyer's classic, and the Scriptures in themselves, expose the much vaunted claims of liberal and ecumenist objectivity as outright fraud.C.S. Lewis, the famous Christian apologist and philosopher, published a book called \\"Miracles.\\" He showed by impeccable logic how miracles are real. Lockyer's book shows from the Bible how the Bible itself is a miracle. And he does so without bothering to argue the point.\\"All the Messianic Prophecies...\\" should be in the library of every Christian. It will strengthen their faith.It will take guts for a non-Christian to read it if they want to remain an non-believer and be objective. To be both would be virtually impossible in view of the truth provided in this volume. How many other books can make such a claim. As a work of a scholar, on that note itself, it stands alone.I am very glad I own a copy. I would be gladder still if all my friends owned one too."},{"Title":"All the Messianic Prophecies of the Bible (The \\"All\\" Series by Dr. Lockyer)","review":"Herbert Lockyer is to be commended for writing such a thorough, entertaining, and readable tome and for so clearly laying out his position. He will likely be seen as a hero among like-minded believers. However, I was disappointed that the author so readily and uncritically adopted a number of fundamental presuppositions, which dramatically limits the audience to which this book might otherwise appeal, and significantly detracts from the scholarship. I find it inexplicable that in a large volume devoted to this single topic Lockyer never broaches the question as to whether the purported prophecies scattered throughout the Old Testament are indeed what orthodox Christianity deems them to be--passages with dual meanings that foreshadow future messianic events. Moreover, the book contains little discussion (aside from the standard dogma) of what prophecies consist in or how they are identified or verified, and is largely silent on the diversity of opinion regarding them. With few exceptions, the author presents his case as though there were virtual unanimity among scholars in accepting the orthodox Christian view. Therefore, I see the work as being essentially \\"devotional\\" rather than scholarly. While this book will no doubt resonate with many Christians, I believe it is easily dismissed by those who are skeptical of Christianity's claims, as I shall explain.First and foremost, Lockyer's presupposition that the Old Testament is replete with prophetic passages concerning Jesus is problematic in that it deftly skirts the most interesting and difficult questions regarding prophecy. Most importantly, what evidence supports the premise of dual meanings? And on what basis can a phrase be deemed prophetic when its original context does not even purport to be prophecy? As Lockyer fails to addresses questions of this nature, the book appears to speak only to those who share his convictions at the outset, and not to those who wish to consider the evidence supporting his convictions. To his credit, however, Lockyer makes this presupposition crystal clear on page 29 when he asserts\\"Our obligation is to believe ALL that ALL the prophets have written of Christ, and search out how their prophecies of Him were fulfilled.\\" (Emphasis in the original.)This single statement illuminates the entire volume. That we bear this obligation to believe is taken as axiomatic by Lockyer, which is presumably why the following questions are never broached: 1) How do we know that the Bible accurately records what was said, when, and by whom, and 2) How do we recognize bona fide prophecies of Jesus?While the former question is often an article of faith among believers, it is a legitimate question of historical veracity for skeptics. Given that even a great many believers concede that the Bible contains interpolations, transcription errors, and even forgeries, the question ought not to be ignored. The second question is far more interesting, however, as some have argued that it admits a clear objective answer: namely, because the probability of one man meeting so many criteria by coincidence alone is infinitesimal. In other words, the close correspondence between the historical Jesus and numerous passages in the Old Testament, even if not originally written as explicit messianic prophecies, singles out Jesus as a unique individual in all of history and simultaneously reveals the passages as miraculous. Lockyer never wavers from this (implicit) position as he meticulously builds what, to most believers, must appear to be an overwhelming case for the divinity of Jesus.Unfortunately, these presuppositions are the primary reason I regard the work as less than scholarly. Lockyer never considers explanations for the correspondences other than their purported prophetic nature; that is, that they are adumbrations of Christianity (most unbeknownst to their authors) that were fulfilled in every detail in the person of Jesus. Yet there is also a perfectly mundane explanation for such correspondences, and Lockyer needn't have looked far to find it. A simple explanation that accounts for the vast majority of the purported prophecies is that the history of Jesus was crafted by weaving together passages from the Old Testament through a practice known as \\"midrash.\\" Given the late inclusion of such details (beginning in the Gospel of Mark), the virtual absence of extrabiblical corroboration, the numerous telltale signs of copied and embellished passages, and the prevalence of midrash among the ancient Jews, this explanation fits the available facts and rests upon well-documented tradition. No supernatural intervention is required, no amazing coincidences are claimed, no conspiracies posited, and no deception or insanity need be invoked. On what grounds, then, does Lockyer completely ignore this and all other alternative explanations?I do not wish to entirely dismiss this author's considerable talents and effort merely because he did not give credence to an alternative theory that I favor. Lockyer has every right to present his ideas from his personal vantage point, omitting those ideas he does not find compelling (or perhaps is unaware of). But doing so clearly limits the audience to those who wish to proceed uncritically from the same presuppositions as Lockyer. Hence, the book cannot be construed as an answer to skeptics, nor can it be construed as a scholarly examination of the evidence; it simply reaffirms what one has already chosen to believe.Even when considered within the genre of devotional literature, however, I must take issue with Lockyer's absurdly exaggerated claims of objectivity and certainty, such as his claim on page 164 that the physical resurrection of Jesus is \\"...one of the best attested facts in history.\\" Although this notion is often echoed in other devotional works and in countless blogs, it's an outlandish claim. Paul makes only abstract references to the event, which are devoid of historical context, while coeval historians are completely silent about it, and the few fragmentary extrabiblical references are dubious at best. In my view, and that of numerous scholars, the historical evidence is extraordinarily weak, resting almost exclusively upon late anonymous hagiographic works (the Gospels) and ultimately upon faith. While everyone is entitled to believe what they wish, such beliefs ought not to be flaunted as well-attested historical facts without sufficient warrant.Lockyer also has a tendency to uncritically embrace all arguments that support his case, exhibiting little interest in gauging the strength of evidence. This tendency is exemplified by his eagerness to accept that \\"500 brethren\\" witnessed the risen Jesus (also on page 164) based on a single vague uncorroborated and possibly inauthentic passage in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians. Lockyer touts this as \\"weighty\\" evidence for the resurrection with no further elaboration. But what did these brethren see? Did they experience \\"visions\\" similar to Paul's? How did Paul come to know of these visions/sightings? Why do none of the Gospels mention this panoply of witnesses? It seems that Lockyer unflinchingly accepts this one Pauline passage as roughly on a par with reliably documented eyewitness testimony, which is quite a leap from what is at best hearsay.Another unfortunate consequence of Lockyer's presuppositions is that he ignores a great many ideas that have direct bearing on the validity of the evidence he invokes. In this large volume Lockyer makes not a single reference to \\"midrash,\\" \\"interpolation,\\" \\"forgery,\\" \\"apotheosis,\\" \\"hagiography,\\" \\"spurious passages,\\" or Markan priority. While many modern Bibles contain annotations flagging spurious or suspicious passages, Lockyer does not mention such difficulties even in passing. Once again, this illustrates that the work cannot be touted as an answer to skeptics, as it routinely ignores troublesome questions rather than addressing them.I gave the book three stars for the quality and thoroughness of the writing. The book will likely be applauded by the audience for which it was intended, but will persuade few that possess a modicum of skepticism. My main complaints are with the wildly exaggerated claims, the nearly complete lack of critical analysis (the most common symptom of which is ignoring alternative explanations), and the inclusion of numerous fanciful interpretations with little or no supporting evidence.Caveat: I've based my review on portions of the book (totaling approximately 30%) that I obtained through an on-line source, and also on numerous keyword searches of the complete text. It is entirely possible that I have misrepresented one or more of the author's views or that some of my criticisms are overly harsh. If so, I'd be happy to entertain rebuttals in the comment section, particularly those that are civil and provide relevant quotes and/or page numbers. If such comments could remain focused on the content of the book, or my criticisms of it, I'd greatly appreciate it."},{"Title":"Discovering the Soul of Service: The Nine Drivers of Sustainable Business Success","review":"Dr. Len Berry keeps pushing the envelope of service.

I always believed customer service should be any service industry's number one core value, and creating the right environment to breed that philosophy was at the top of my priority list.This book has captured the secrets to developing and sustaining a culture of excellent customer service which any company will surely benefit from, especially if its livelihood depends on taking good care of customers."},{"Title":"Discovering the Soul of Service: The Nine Drivers of Sustainable Business Success","review":"It is easy to see why Leonard Berry is certain that this book is his best work.

Overall, this book deserves to be studied not only by service practitioners, but by the highest levels of corporate management.

My conclusion? Rock-solid. In fact, both books are even more relevant - and more valuable - now than they were when Leonard Berry wrote them. That is amazing...and commendable.With regard to the title of this book, consider this brief excerpt from the concluding chapter: \\"Great service companies have a soul that underlies their strategies and day-to-day operations. The company's soul - its value system - is its foundational center, its inner core.\\" Berry fully understands how difficult it is to achieve and then sustain a great service company, noting that such companies are \\"humane communities that humanely serve customers and the broader communities in which they live.\\" Decision-makers, especially in companies which have problems attracting and then retaining the talented, skilled, and principled people needed, would be well-advised to consider very carefully the meaning and significance of Berry's concluding observation. The same can be said for companies which have problems keeping valued customers and don't know why.As Berry explains, his purpose in this book is to identify, describe, and illustrate the underlying drivers of sustainable success in service businesses. Creating a successful service operation is unquestionably a difficult task...The greater involvement of people in creating value for customers, the greater the challenge.\\" He examines 14 outstanding service companies which include The Container Store, the Charles Schwab Corporation, Chick-fil-A, Enterprise Rent-a-Car, the St. Paul Saints AAA baseball franchise, and USAA. He suggests what lessons can be learned from them. Although quite different in terms of their size and nature, they demonstrate the same nine drivers of success, to each of which Berry devotes a separate chapter.One of his key points is that humane core values sustain human service energy as organizations grow and mature. When the \\"product\\" is a human performance, values-driven leadership is at the center of sustainable success. He focuses on often-neglected or under-appreciated basics and explains how the superior service to which the exemplary companies are wholly committed creates for each of them a significant, perhaps decisive competitive advantage. The core strategies seems obvious: focus on serving a specific market need rather than on marketing a specific product for that need, focus on serving underserved market needs, and focus on serving the chosen markets with executional excellence. When stressing the importance of \\"trust-based\\" relationships, Berry includes everyone involved in the given enterprise. Hence the importance of what he characterizes as \\"humane organizational values\\" and he correctly insists that such values depend on values-driven leadership which must permeate the organization, at all levels and in all areas of operation. Stable leadership stabilizes values and propels all other success sustainers.Of special interest to me is what he has to say about Cora Griffith in Chapter 8, \\"Investment in Employee Success.\\" She is a long-time waitress for the Orchard Caf&eacute; in Appleton, Wisconsin. According to Berry, she implements each day the nine rules of success: she treats each customer like family, she is an alert listener, she strives to anticipate her customers' wants, she is attentive to significant details (\\"simple things make the difference\\"), she \\"works smart\\" by constantly scanning all the tables, maintains an on-going effort to improve her skills while learning new ones, and is contented in her work. \\"Cora is a team player, an all for one, one for all employee.\\" She takes great pride in her work. And credits her employers, Dick and John Bergstrom, for convincing her how important it is to take good care of each customer and who gave her the \\"freedom\\" to do it. How many service providers have you encountered lately who measure up to Cora Griffith's standards? The sad fact is that most service providers could but, for whatever reasons, don't.It is to Berry's great credit that he recognizes the importance - and significance -- of the Cora Griffiths in this society at a time when most books which discuss superior customer service focus almost entirely on companies such Nordstrom, Ritz-Carlton, and Southwest Airlines. They are indeed exemplary organizations but two points need to be made: Each has its own significant number of Cora Griffiths, and, the same high level of customer service can be provided by all other organizations, even by a hotel restaurant in a small midwestern town.With all due respect to Mies van der Rohe, God may not be in the details but \\"the soul of service\\" certainly is."},{"Title":"Discovering the Soul of Service: The Nine Drivers of Sustainable Business Success","review":"It is very difficult for me to work with \\"interviews and case study\\" based books since they are almost invariably full of \\"brilliant\\" quotes and \\"success and beyond-duty\\" stories that, to say the least, sound too good as to be of a sustainable nature in real world. This book is based on experiences and what seems very solid research and, for sure, is not free of this type of passages; and yet, it is one of the most useful and often-referenced books that I own and work with. So, if you will yourself through it, you'll find one of the best and most down-to-earth books on Customer Service. The author identifies nine drivers that can make any organization successful, all of them emphasizing the human nature of the relationship with customers (customer-centered). It is truly a recipe for success, more easily applicable to on-going enterprises rather than to start-ups. From this book the reader can produce very useful check-lists to diagnose the company and its strategic practices regarding their service approach. It can also be used as a guiding document to move a company to a truly customer-awareness territory and, most important, to keep it there. Of special relevance is the author's brilliant exposition in the final chapter \\"Lessons from World-Class Service Companies\\", where the reader obtains a rarely seen synopsis of all the good things that excellent companies do \\"to sustain their excellence\\".

If you like &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker's Creek,&quot; be sure to read &quot;Inland Island&quot; by Josephine Johnson. She has the same unromanticized view of nature's uncompromising rule (whatever survives, works), and she has the mind of an agnostic poet expressed in prose. Example: I think it is disgusting to praise God for making us acknowledge His presence by a poke in our eyeballs with His sharp stick.And: All day, a rain of life and death goes on. A catbird crashed against the pane and fell gasping. Then it gathered itself in a narrow canoe shape and lay there patiently waiting to recover or die. Awareness is a name of agony. I wish there was something to pray to for its life. But one must not get excited. One must not grieve. Nature, Mom, all-powerful, monstrous and monolithic Mother sits and chooses.The whole book is wonderful! I wish I could read it again for the first time just for the pleasure of its discovery."},{"Title":"The Inland Island","review":"What a strange little book. Reading at times like a nature primer, a stream of consciousness practice, and an anti-war rant, Josephine Johnson's month-by-month tribute to her patch of land and the animals that inhabit it is a literary piece badly in need of an editor.Rambling, unfocused, and sometimes meandering off in directions that have no resolution, it's not an easy book to read. There are moments of real beauty, as in the following passage:\\"The feeling of all this unknown creature-life that passes and repasses here brings on a curious dreamlike feeling of enchantment. It is the seed of fairy tales, the seeking of lost valleys. Timeless pockets in the world of time. Either I should not ever leave, or I should not return again\\".Now that's lovely, and the book is sprinkled with more of the same. However, Johnson decided that it wasn't good enough to write about the natural world. Instead, she added strange references to the ongoing Vietnam war (this book was published in 1969), oblique references about the quality of life in the elderly, a couple of agnostic/atheistic moralizations with some pagan wisdom thrown in for good measure. It needed only the addition of: \\"Kumbiya, my Lord, Kumbiya\\", and I'm just about ready to throw on my tie-dyed sundress, throw a flower in my headband and run barefoot through the mary-jane scented fields at Woodstock. Nothing wrong with any of that per se, but WTH does it have to do with chickadees, deer, muskrats and racoons?A book ruined, IMO, with observations that had nothing to do with the scope of the book.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?

He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"which is a waste of paper. What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it. Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason. I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one. In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'. The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair)."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

His intellectual prowess not only perceives him as a mystical thriller but between the lines you can see the seductive yet fanatical characters he enlists. Before Stephen King his writing is considered fascinating and is still to this day one of the premier writers of history.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a true classic."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated. And if you ever need a quick comeback, quoting Dorian Gray will throw off most anyone. And if it doesn't, perhaps you will have a new friend!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is going to have to be one of the best books I read this whole year. I so would love to have this book be a movie. It takes such interesting turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the whole era has always been pleasing to me. What a fun read!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Four stars because it's a bit slow at times. The imagery in the book is quite good and the moral is well taken.

Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well.

It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through. Lots of old English and lots of footnotes describing what the words or phrases meant. I struggled through about 3/4 of the book, but then it picked up and I managed to get it read. In the end, it was worth the time and effort but does take some patience to get through. Not for everyone."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It makes one think what would happen if one were to remain young/immortal. Part of our lives revolve around aging, preparing for that, and what have you, while Dorian doesn't have to.

It's overall a good read, and I'd recommend this to anyone who is in need of a good, classic read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was difficult to read at first. I accept that the great ones always take a while to hook you as they build the characters. It has been a while since I read this book and yet much of it is fresh in my mind. Not a beach read. It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later.

Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time. I finished it in one day, because I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book, and all other Oscar Wilde works for that matter."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a Faustian novel, and one of the first ground-breaking pieces of gothic literature along with novels such as \\"The Castle of Otranto\\" by Horace Walpole and \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" by Anne Radcliffe. Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out. Chances are, going in, you know the premise of the novel, but I still don't want to risk a spoiler. Either way, slowly, he starts to lose himself, and the gentleness of his nature, and he is driven to \\"sin\\".It's a good read in many ways. For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \\"curse\\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions. Is beauty only skin deep and what happens to the outside of someone who has become hideous inside?With beautiful turns of phrase and provoking insights which will invade your thoughts long after you put the book down, this is a class worth your time."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is really worth reading! Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious.

He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems?

This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it. This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process. It was very good and I advise as many people as possible to read it."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A great classic. It's better the second or third time.Dorian Gray, a fabulously good-looking young man with a poetic glow about him, starts out innocent and pure. His more worldly acquaintances spoil him with many observations on how wonderful it must be to be young and fabulously handsome.Reflecting on his own beauty in an amazingly like portrait of himself, his obsession becomes never growing old. The earnest prayer he utters before the portrait grants his wish. Now only the portrait will show the effects of age. And the stains on his character.For the rest of the book we see his life become his beauty. All the other important things in life fall away. Everyone wishes they could have his life of fortune and youth, but they have no idea how his soul is suffering. Neither does he.There are some passages that might appear wordy. There are many moving and inspiring passages, if one takes the time to reflect on them.This is a great book. Your teenager will probably be assigned to read it in middle-school or high school; you should read it too."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is a classic novel suffused with intriguing philosophies along with discrete ethical lessons. Oscar Wilde encorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture.

Society artist Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray which ages and hardens as Gray's quest lead him to a remorseless and brutal lifestyle is the mirror to his soul while his physical form remains as youthful as ever. The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale.

And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years.

At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century.

The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull.

Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly.

I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie based on the other reviews, and found it to be a good read.

There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Perhaps I'm jaded by modern science fiction conventions (ala The Twilight Zone), but I felt Dorian Gray ended predictably. Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. Moreover, with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story, Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading some of the contemporary reviews of this book, I was more than a little curious to see how awful this book really was. I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\\""},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the version I read while first discovering the many talents of Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment. He becomes a person driven by pleasure and he decides to experience everything he can, whether it's good or evil. Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing. Never read any Oscar Wilde before, and didn't think I would love it. Truely witty dialogue and great morality tales are both fun and though provoking. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel. Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so.

When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction.

Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake.

It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book.

Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde. This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face. A Picture of Dorian Gray is now one of my most favorite books of all time. If only Wilde had written more than one novel!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was shunned by the public after publishing The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul. How tarnished it becomes if we live a bad life, etcetera.I recommended anyone to read this Wilde masterpiece. You do not have to like horror to enjoy it. Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read.

But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book. It is engrossing, absorbing, entertaining, and not the least bit boring. Brilliant."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel provides a fascinating story on a young man's desire to keep his appearance while having his age expressed and progressed in a portrait of himself. The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life. I have read this book as an assignment for preparation toward the AP [Advance Placement] test in English Literature and enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who, not only would like to prepare for an AP test in English, but to those who appreciate philosophy."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde).

This is a classic that one should truly make time to read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading. Still, I would not rate this work of art as an excellent one. Its actuality for todays life is limited and, on my opinion, contains too much unbased social philosophy."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"about an old classic like Dorian Gray? Still entertaining after all these years. A bit wordy for the new crowd, but the lesson of the story is infinite."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fantastic quotes and very poetically written book. Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Occasionally one reads a book that leaves a lasting impact in one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and crops up at the most curious of times. \\"Dorian Gray\\" by the brilliant Oscar Wilde is such a one for this reviewer. While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is real entertainment. You have debauchery, murder, a love story that isn't really one, a main character that you both like and hate, and some kind of supernatural thing going on (usually not my cup of tea, but this case is the exception of the rule.) The best part of the book was that I kept wanting to know what happened next, and there were enough twists and turns to be interesting, yet still believable. I highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this when I was in High School and read it again now and I still see Oscar as a genius.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy.

Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try.

After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before).

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read. Boy, was I wrong. The book held my interest for the first half, but it got very boring.

If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I think Dorian Gray is a book that is different for different people. For me it was a new experience, because I haven't read many books from the 19th century. I would believe that at the time when it was first published, it was a very different book for everyone. You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism. Notwithstanding, this book was a pleasure to read! It was easy to understand and was smattered with references to events and literature which were likely considered posh by English nobility in the mid-ninteenth century (i.e. Shakespeare, Greek Mythology, etc.). As stated above, this book is very reflective of the author in both spirit and style. I would definately recommend this book to a beginner reader of the English classics, due to its length and lack of confounding implicies which are common for this type of literature."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wish I could give this book more stars but I can't.

Wilde did an outstanding job in conveying his thoughts and opinions through Lord Henry. Dorian Gray was a very intriguing character who made me really think about myself and my actions. The only downfall of this book, in my opinion, is that there was no substantial background given on Lord Henry. I kept waiting to find out about his history, but there was none. Oh well...just adds more to the mystery surrounding the entire story."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The definition of &quot;classic&quot; is something timeless and universal; this book is neither. It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the hideous painting?The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward, the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine! I dare not give it away, for you must venture into those pages to find out where all the events lead to. The last page of the book is truly the climax. You'll be left shivering with sweat trickling down your forehead just to see what happens.&quot;Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature,&quot; Lord Henry claims in one part of the story. Nay, they don't, I must say - for it was an Englishman that produced this book!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.

However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's.

The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's amazing how Wilde's words continue to ring so true in this day and age.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. ."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After letting his friend Basil Hallward paint a portrait of him, Dorian Gray makes a wish to the heavens above that the the picture would take on all his sins and showings of age and he would remain youthfull and boyish. Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering. Its best to read with a dictionary near by or atleast some knowledge of English Literature and diction."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A comely, vain, innocent young man named Dorian Gray gets his portrait painted and hides it away in an unused room in his house. After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill. This is the book which reveals that Oscar Wilde was blackballed by the Oxford Union."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century.

Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar WildeI have downloaded this ebook and have found it to be the most well thought out in terms of navigation."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's classic gothic tale of a man who is granted his wish to remain forever young is still a fine and compelling read. Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

Dorian teaches me a very important lesson:You can never escape the consequences of evil and regardless of how fortunate you are in some areas of your life, there are always lurking in our souls those moments of shame and regret.I know that the book has many messages about narcissism, beauty, art, conscience, friendship, social classes and other topics, but Dorian's inability to shake his evil actions is what I will remember the most."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables. Aside from the tangents on his experiences abroad and the scents of different flowers and such, it was a good read. Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

Indulgence and youth and beauty -- these are things that really matter in life.Good book. Bad moral."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

Wilde is a genius of literature.

The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book.

But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect.

The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot.

I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel!

However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"An absolute classic. This has always been my favorite. I highly recommend this book. It gets better everytime I read it!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is a classic. Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb. I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty. He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember.

In this story, Dorian Gray is an extraordinarlily good looking man. As he is so beautiful, painters use him as a sitter. One day, as he is looking over a portait of himself he realizes the fragility of his beauty and wishes for portrait of himself to grow old, rather than himself. For this, he would give his soul; and that was exacly what happened.This is no ordinary book. This book is funny and interesting. While reading this book, you will find that it is saturated with Wilde's epigrams and wonderful sense of humor. I admired it quite intensely, just as Wilde has."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian Gray is an excellent story that shows how money and beauty not allways lead to happiness.

Do you want to know why this doesn't make him happy? Magnificent ending. Read it"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility. However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into. The first half is a way for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading.

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design.

One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.

This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain.

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The effective board of trustees (American Council on Education/Macmillan series on higher education)","review":"This book lays the foundations for any board member to understand his or her role.

He shows us many ways we may be evading the very goal of our prayer, how we may be shielding ourselves from God's light shining upon us.Merton did not write this book in order to become popular. It is not all sweetness and gentle breezes of the Spirit. It is more like a cold wind that seeks to blow away our defenses and leave us face to face with what our souls really want - God. Whether we enjoy the process is not the point, but a book like this lets us know that we are not alone on the path, that, tough as it is, others have gone before.

In doing so he provides exercises for the contemplative novice (like me) and warns against bad habits of prayer that are easy to fall into. Here is his explanation of the purpose of monastic prayer: \\"To prepare the way so that God's action may develop this 'faculty for the supernatural,' this capacity for inner illumination gy faith and by the light of wisdom, in the loving contemplation of God\\" (p. 45). He writes well and clearly; one need not be a monk or an academic to understand what he is teaching.This was the first book of Merton's I ever read. I read it during a grief-filled time in my life when I felt the need of something to anchor me, to help me to pray more meaningfully, to concentrate on listening to God more than on my own verbalizing. At one point he says that he is easily distracted by many things; I realized that I had just heard my true name--Easily Distracted By Many Things--for the first time. He promised to teach \\"a way of keeping oneself in the presence of God and of reality, rooted in one's own inner truth\\" (p. 23), and he did.The book's introduction is by Thich Nhat Hanh, a Zen Buddhist; it includes a helpful series of prayers as well.Merton helped me to heal, and to grow from the healing, and to re-engage an often hurting world. He opened up what was to me a new practice in Christian spirituality. I recommend you read him."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"This book is profound: in a mere 116 pages Merton reveals indispensable spiritual insights one after another. Contemplation is the practice of seeking clarity--a clear vision of who we are, a clear vision of our relationship to God. So, with honest, relentless precision, Merton exposes our false postures of ego, pride, attachement, fear--those unholy but seductive impulses that cloud our souls and separate us from God. It is obvious that \\"Contemplative Prayer\\" is the product of an experienced contemplative, one who has experienced and reflected upon a lifetime of struggle, enough so that he can boil down the essence of spiritual survival into a handful of simple words. But he does much more than that: after shattering each underpinning of our personal complacency, he draws back and puts his observations in their monastic and theological context, giving us a fuller, deeper understanding of the religious tradition we belong to. For example, at one point, Merton elegantly and brilliantly summarizes \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" (St. John of the Cross) in a way that makes it fully relevant to the modern reader. As a bonus, this edition contains an introduction by the distinguished Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh (who in some respects is himself a Buddhist version of Thomas Merton). Hahn explores and compares the spiritual struggles of Buddhism and Christianity with respect to prayer, meditation, practice, and God--on those crucial levels we see that ultimately we have one nature, despite the obvious and superficial differences that tend to separate us. On a literary note, \\"Contemplative Prayer\\" will be particularly interesting to those drawn to existentialism or seeking a deeper understanding of it. At first glance, one might think no two people could be further apart than Camus' Stranger and the Christian contemplative, but they are in fact quite alike. Both have heightened awareness of their true nature. Both acknowledge the meaninglessness of the world formerly thought of as \\"real\\". Both have learned that contemplation of the real comes at a heavy price, yet one that is unavoidable to the soul honestly seeking truth. Christian, Buddhist, existentialist...in the end it seems we are all drawn to the same road."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"This book, 'Contemplative Prayer', was Thomas Merton's last book. A prolific writing on spiritual topics, Merton was perhaps in an ideal setting to be able to write about the ideas and methods of contemplative prayer, being a Trappist. Trappists devote themselves to prayer, adding the disciplines of silence and solitude, things that are needed for the contemplative side of things to emerge.In the introduction by Merton's friend, Thich Nhat Hanh, there is a nine-fold prayer that relates to many of Merton's ideas about contemplative prayer. However, it is a mistake (and both Hanh in the introduction and Merton in the text mention this) to think that prayer is something in and of itself - Christians and Buddhists tend to have the understanding that prayer without practice lacks efficacy.Merton traces a strong history of contemplative prayer, from the earliest Christians (particularly the Desert Fathers and early monastics) to the latest theologians (Hahn relates Merton's ideas to Paul Tillich, and without mentioning him by name, Merton also seems to strive for that same purity that was the pursuit of Kierkegaard). Merton concentrates especially on various 'via negativa' methods and theologies - St. John of the Cross is but the most powerful example, but Merton draws on Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, Catherine of Siena, Meister Eckhart and others.This is not a how-to manual for contemplative prayer. This was a subject that was beginning to interesting Merton more and more near the time of his death, and we can but wonder if he would have gone on to produce more practical writing on the topic after this piece. However, Merton, being a person with a good grasp for the authority and power of tradition and history, understood that the first task would be to understand what people have done before and how things have worked or not worked, before embarking upon a new subject for oneself. This is that product, and we are the poorer for not having a follow-up to the book.Reading Merton is never wasted time. This is perhaps less 'spiritual' and more 'academic' than much of his writing, but it still has characteristic Merton sensitivity to subject, and is worthwhile for any looking for a deeper understanding of comtemplative practices."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"&quot;Without true, deep contemplative aspirations, without a total love for GOD and an uncompromising thirst for his truth, religion tends in the end to become an opiate.&quot; These are the words with which Thomas Merton (1916-1968) closes this book. I learned to appreciate that meditation is an embracing of reality more than a retreat from reality. I have been inspired to focus more clearly on the situation at hand and to reveal how my spiritual relationship can improve what I see. It is easy for me to be distracted by many things during the day, and this tendency is only exacerbated when the task is daunting. Thomas Merton has taught me that, in meditation, I am advantaged by an attitude or outlook of faith, openness, attention, reverence, expectation, supplication, trust, and joy. All these finally permeate my being with love in so far as my living faith tells me I am in the presence of the LORD, that I live in Christ, that in the Spirit of the LORD I &quot;see&quot; the LORD, my GOD, without &quot;seeing.&quot; I know her in &quot;unknowing.&quot; Faith is the bond that unites me to him in the Spirit who gives me light and love. If you are interested in meditation in the twentieth century, or in building a stronger spiritual awareness, this book will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Thomas Merton, a great teacher of spiritual principles above and beyond religion and institutionalized group consciousness.Merton became a Buddhist at the end of his journey. Not the Buddhist of religious philosophy but the Zen experience far beyond explanation,structure and preconceived verbal formulas with absolutely no objectification, including that of God.Notice this quote and ask yourself, \\"Is this a description of the Christian contemplative or a Zen Master? Then again, the Zen ontological experience of say D.T. Suzuki can no doubt be likened to the Christian mystic, Meister Eckart.\\"Comtemplative prayer comes only when we are able to \\"let go\\" of everything within us, to enter into \\"emptiness,\\" that is to let go of all desire to see, to know, to taste and to experience the presence of God. It is only then when we truly become able to experience his presence. It is neither the desire nor the refusal of desire that counts, but only that \\"desire\\" which is a form of \\"emptiness.\\" Not the false emptiness of simply \\"blacking out\\" our thoughts in systematic methods and techniques, where emptiness becomes a thing, but rather the true emptiness that is a no-thing, a nothing, which is total inclusivenss, able to trancend all things, and yet is immanent in all. For what seems to be emptiness in this case is pure being. Or at least a philosopher might so describe it, but to the Christian contemplative is it other than that. It is not this, not that. Whatever you say of it,it is other than what you say. The character of emptiness, at least for a Christian contemplative, is pure love, pure freedom, free of everything, not determined by any thing, or held down by any special relationship, but a pure unconditional, nonparitial, nonjudgemental, inclusive love. 5 stars do not do this book any justice.\\""},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Thomas Merton's final book, this slim volume in many ways concludes the spiritual journey begun in The Seven Story Mountain. It is a guide for young monks in the aspirations and discipline of contemplative prayer, but it is also a deeply felt meditation on the condition of (especially modern) mankind and its apartness from God. The general reader will find profound wisdom of a rigorous and mature intellect which compliments and sums Merton's earlier work."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Contemplative Prayer, the last book by the renowned Trappist monk Thomas Merton, is a treatise on the practice, benefits and dangers of contemplative prayer for modern day monks. Although it seems to have been written primarily for others that have devoted their lives to monastic living, the casual reader and spiritual seeker can still glean much from Merton's book. In its 19 chapters, Merton takes the reader from the desert, through the dark nights of contemplation, to the effects that such contemplation should have on the contemplative and, therefore, on the world.Merton combines both personal insight and traditional Christian teachings on the practice of contemplative prayer; his sources include Scripture, the Desert Fathers, Patristic texts, as well as mystical writings from the Christian tradition, most notably those of St. John of the Cross. Perhaps reflecting the ecumenical spirit of the middle to late 60s that was present in the Roman Catholic Church - due in large part to Vatican II - Merton also uses various ascetic writings from the Eastern Orthodox Church, most notably excerpts from the Philokalia, which is sometimes referred to as \\"the Bible of Eastern Orthodox spirituality.\\" Merton's use of sources and personal insight serve to convey a deep understanding of the practice of contemplative prayer; the reader is left feeling that (s)he is in the presence of a spiritual guide, a wise fellow seeker, and a friend.There are two other sources that are worth pointing out although they are less obvious than the sources cited above. First, the existentialist theme that runs through the book is worth noting; Merton seems to desire to engage some of the intellectual trends of his time with his book. Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Gabriel Marcel are both alluded to and cited throughout the pages of this book; the idea of an \\"existentialist dread\\" of death and the darkness within the human self serve, at different times, as points of departure for Merton's teachings. Given the teachings of the urgency of the moment that both Existentialism and Christianity espouse and the unrest that was a part of life in both the United States and in the international community, such a coupling of Existentialism and Christian spirituality makes a lot of sense.Secondly, Merton mentions at points the ground that the soul meets God on. Such an idea seems to recall the teaching of Meister Eckhart, the controversial Dominican monk and mystic of the 13th century . Merton never cites Eckhart and given the controversy surrounding the condemnation of Eckhart's, if Eckhart is a source for Merton's thought, Merton's apprehension of citing Eckhart makes sense. The parallels are worth noting, though. Yet, unlike Eckhart, Merton does not view union with God as an experience of the self dissolving into the Godhead. In fact, Merton does not at any point actually mention \\"union with God\\", but describes instead \\"the creative and healing work of the monk [by God]\\" as being \\"a participation in the saving death and resurrection of Christ\\" (26). Such language about \\"participation\\" certainly recalls the language used by the Greek Fathers when discussing union with God, a union where the Creator and the creature remain distinct but in a full, intimate communion.Contemplative Prayer, although short, is not a light read. It calls one to look within before looking without; it is a call for self-confrontation. Each chapter - and even parts of chapters - could be read and meditated upon for days on end. This is a good thing, though, as it makes this book helpful guide for the spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"In this book, Merton has given us a view of the contemplative prayer as practiced by the order in which he was a member. He then goes on to explain why the practice is done and the meaning that it holds. Even more effective though, is how Merton then takes the lay person who has an interest into the role of a contemplative. He opens the door for the lay person to begin a life of contemplative prayer ahile learnign to understand it as the monks do. It is also phenomenal how well it relates to the Bhuddist prayer life as related in the introduction. this book is highly recommended by this reader for those who are searching for a start, or an explanation of why, there is a contemplative prayer life."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Merton wrote this, his last book, to offer guidance to contemplatives, particularly with their inevitable encounter with inward times of darkness and barrenness. Citing many different monks, Merton has graced us with a work of incredible profundity and beauty--and in doing so put his final touch on the mission described so poetically by Blake: &quot;We are put on earth for a little space to learn to bear the beams of love.&quot;"},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Thomas Merton's thoughtful work on Contemplative Prayer is worthy of careful contemplation by Christians of all traditions. The chapters are brief as is the book but it contains many powerful ideas. Merton is careful to not separate contemplation from either corporate worship or service. He will have none of the false dichotomy of \\"spiritual\\" life and \\"earthly\\" life. He also avoids pointing to contemplation as a gimmick or a method for true spirituality. The highlight of the book for me came on page 112. There Merton writes, \\"Prayer does not blind us to the world, but it transforms our vision of the world, and makes us see it, all men and all the history of mankind, in the light of God.\\"I come from a different Christian tradition than Thomas Merton, but I value his insights as I seek to walk the sometimes fearful, sometimes exhilirating, sometimes inscrutable path of prayer."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Merton is not out to convince anyone of anything in this book. His is a mission to destroy the defenses we all build which shield us from Truth -- from God. Therefore, it is frightening. However, it is comforting as well: Merton has experienced the &quot;dread&quot; of which he speaks and also the wellspring of new life which travels in its wake.

Above all please believe and read this book.Originally published by Cistercian Publications asClimate of Monastic Prayer: Cistercian Studies Series Number One (1), this book has an interesting exodus on its way to this accessible Image Book publication.In October of 1968, a few months then before his untimely, tragic death under still suspicious circumstances, this book, here of about one hundred pages, received the Ecclesiastical Approval for publication from the Abbot General of the Cistercian Order Ignacio Gillet, and the Bishop of Worcester Bernard Flanagan. Merton's writings often had a difficult time in the office of Gillet, whose aide entrusted with reviewing English language texts was not very masterful in comprehending the English language, yet this met approval, and meets the approval here of so many reviews, and I urge yours as well.Read this valuable, brief book, please. Bring peace to your heart and mind and eternal soul, and thus to our world.Increasingly valuable is the humble introduction by the well known spiritual master Thich Nhat Hanh, author of among several other well-known works,Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life, writing this introduction in December 1995, a quarter century after Father Merton's death. This fortifying introduction begins - I first met Thomas Merton in 1966, and continues through a concise presentation of prayer among our Desert Fathers, including St. Macarius. We also find here a very strong nine step prayer, which we are urged to pray for ourself, for the person we like, for the person we love, for the person who is neutral to us, and finally for the person we suffer to think of. We are also urged to pray these for the group, people or nation we like, the one we love, the one neutral to us, and finally the one we suffer to think of. In this way we may finally come to realize what it truly is to follow the commandment of Jesus Christ to Love our enemy. This prayer alone is worth the slight price of this book. Reading Father Louis' presentation of contemplative prayer is the great cathedral we enter through the portal of this gentle introduction which concludes - It is a pleasure for me to write these lines to introduce his book.Thich Nhat Hanh had shared with us the words Father Louis used upon the death of his teacher in Vietnam in that time of war: Brother, please know that your teacher is now utterly free.We know now that Father Louis is utterly free, and Thich Nhat Hanh utterly compassionate in sharing this truth so subtly with us. Please read most thoughtfully, prayerfully this great if tiny fruit of his long life of arduous service as monk.

This is not a book in which you will find the latest gimmick which &quot;brings you closer to God.&quot; This book is more of a history lesson mixed with advice. I have problems with the introduction. It is written by a Buddhist who tries to say that there is no big difference between Christ and Buddha. I do not feel this man should be allowed to push his agenda in this place just because the man was Merton's friend. However, we can overlook this, for the rest of the book proves more intelligent and useful. In this book Merton walks through the history of monastic thought about prayer in a step by step manner. His commentary is useful in seeing how the different ideas about prayer came about. He does tend to have a bias towards his own ideas. Therefore, I recommend this book to those interested in the history of prayer in the monastic tradition. I cannot however, endorse this book in good conscience to those seeking to learn about prayer itself. For those interested in learning about prayer in and of itself, I suggest Richard Foster's book on the topic."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"Thomas Merton was a Roman Catholic monk who wrote \\"Contemplative Prayer\\" as a primer (not a how-to book) for monks developing a prayer life. To help these monks, Merton attempts to define contemplateive prayer, offers its benefits, and points out dangers associated with it.Merton distinguishes contemplative prayer from liturgical/corporate prayer. The latter fully engages the mind and emotions as a Christian decides what he wants to communicat to God, then expresses these thoughts/feelings. Contemplative prayer differs in that the Christian attempts to devoid himself of all his thoughts and feelings so that God can come directly to him--increasing this Christian's faith and understanding.While this result is great indeed, there are also horrible dangers associated with contemplative prayer. The Christian a) may be contacted by a demon, b) might lose his faith, c) might experience intense dread as he believes that God has abandoned him, d) fools himself into thinking that God came to him when he actually created thoughts and feelings himself (and he thus becomes secure in false belief).Merton deliniates particular blessings that one can gain through contemplative prayer. While an increased personal faith in and understanding of God is an individual's blessing, the Church is also blessed by contemplative prayer. Merton argues that deep contemplative prayer makes corporate/liturgical prayer more meaningful, which makes contemplative prayer deeper, etc. in a sort of upward spiral. He takes this idea further by advancing the idea that if it were not for the contemplative prayers of the monks, the Church (relying only on liturgical prayer) would move increasingly further away from Jesus Christ and lose its saving faith.I disagree with this last point because I disagree with Merton's analysis of contemplative prayer. Merton advocates an immediate (without physical means), subjective encounter with God over and against a mediate (through physical means) objective encounter. God encounters the Christian through Scripture and the Sacraments and has given us physical, mental, and emotional faculties to respond to him. The idea that a correct understanding of God comes not through mediate means but through subjective personal experience runs counter to Biblical teachings.Active meditation (where you actually do something, as opposed to Merton's idea of prayer) can certainly aid the Christian as well as the Church in the above described \\"upward spiral.\\" Contemplating Scripture (that is, actually thinking about it and wrestling with it) does make prayer and worship more meaningful. However, emptying yourself of all your thoughts and emotions with the hope that God will be compelled to come to you is just plain dangerous--even if Christians of other centureis did it. Stick to Bible and Sacraments.This book is not recommended."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"If you want to learn about the spiritual deception of Contemplative Prayer, this book is good. Thomas Merton mentions his associations with Zen Buddhists and has written other books about Zen. Because I see this form of prayer creeping into the Christian church, I wanted to learn more about it, to warn others who may be deceived by Rick Warren and the Emerging Church movement that is changing the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ and recommending New Age techniques. Thomas Merton tells you how to empty your mind (meditate), but he also warns of the dangers of this and that some have had mental breakdowns while meditating. This is the last days apostasy that is mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:3."},{"Title":"Contemplative Prayer","review":"My mother ordered this book for me in hopes that I could use it in my study on prayer. I was very thankful! After all, I'd heard the author's name many times, and I expected great things. After only a paragraph or so through the introduction I started to get a handle on the book.For starters, anyone who is interested in prayer but also a firm believer in \\"sola scriptura\\" (only scripture)must consider this book carefully. The author gives a lot of quasi-spiritual mumbo jumbo and very little scripture on the subject. He's also very inclusive of the Eastern religions, so one can see a blending of this inner-light/meditation-consciousness business. It can be very confusing, and it's very VERY far from biblical.Secondly, the author approaches seemingly every subject from the standpoint of \\"experience\\" and not truth (scripture). When trying to understand Christian prayer with the only Christian God, one must support his teaching with the Christian Bible.I'm tired of reviewing, but let's just say I'll be using this book as an example of heresy existing in the church. I'm terribly sad to see it represented so highly by supposed Christians. Don't disappoint yourself with this purchase, unless you don't believe in the Bible.

In that book, Goffman, a sociologist, discusses the rise of \\"Total Institutions\\", i.e. institutions that totally control the lives of those within. Melville's \\"White Jacket\\" is a book that Goffman often referred to in order to illustrate different aspects of life within the total institution.The introductory essay to this book discusses White Jacket in relationship to the growing bro-ha-ha over slavery, but I thought the book was much more interesting then that.What was most suprising to me, having never read Melville before, was how funny some of the chapters were. Episodes involving Surgeon Cuticle amputating the leg of an unwilling seaman recall the funniest moments of television shows like Monty Python or the Simpsons.Melville's accurate portrayal of life within the \\"T.I.\\", reminded me of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\". There, the setting is an insane asylum, here it is a Man O' Wear, but both books deal with the tactics and strategies an individual might employ when faced with an oppressive living environment.Although I am not sure when, or if, I might try to tackle author's masterpiece 'Moby Dick', I did come away from this book with a profound respect for Melville's capabilities as a writer. I will no longer take for granted his status among the pantheon of American writers."},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"The title, \\"White Jacket\\", serves as a double entendre by the author, Herman Melville. He actually sews up a hand-stitched jacket made from white sail cloth and other material, but it is ill-fitting, continually wet, ineffective against the cold, and actually the source of trouble between himself and the crew. So, the white jacket is a suit of his own making that very well brings about his own downfall. In the end, he discards it when he sees himself about to drown. And so, Melville uses this theme to serve as a metaphor for white superiority and the threatening danger of civil war over slavery.Indeed, Melville experiences effective slavery during his voyage aboard the USS United States (USS Neversink in the book) during its run from the Pacific back to the Atlantic. And like so many black slaves, he and his crewmates suffer the ever-present threat of public lashings for even minor infractions. So, Melville also uses his book as an indictment against a hypocritical system, whereby officers are never wrong and never experience corporal punishment but the enlisted crew remain in perpetual danger of arousing the slightest displeasure of any officer with the ultimate result of a humiliating public lashing. However, no military organization could function effectively if it were a democratic institution; who would ever risk their life in such a case? (Even the early Communists quickly abandoned that principle.)But the vast majority of the book focuses on the minute details of life aboard a frigate during the age of sail. Several hundred (500?) souls are packed into the space of a single wooden vessel for months on end. How the ship is organized and the rituals of life aboard ship are the mainstay of the book. Melville describes in factual detail the actual work (trimming sails, cleaning decks, etc.), the daily routines (meals on deck, standing watches, playing cards in secret, sleeping in the crew's quarters), the professions (sailor, waistman, quartermaster, boatswain, carpenter, surgeon, captain, commodore, purser, midshipmen, chaplain, pharmacist, cook, cockswain, gunner, and yeoman), the less usual events (floggings, making a port of call, receiving official dignitaries aboard ship, rounding Cape Horn, the order of Neptune initiation rites, rumors of war), and all the underlying social structure and tensions ever-present.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in life aboard naval ships in the days of sail. With the rise of modern wireless communication, captains no longer enjoy such an absolute despotism as in times previous, but he still remains the unchallenged master aboard US navy vessels. While much of life aboard ship has changed, probably half of the book would still be quite familiar to modern-day sailors."},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"I wanted to celebrate the Fourth of July by reading a classic work of American literature and decided to reread Melville's \\"White-Jacket\\", alternatively titled \\"The World in a Man-of-War\\". The book was Melville's fifth novel, written just before \\"Moby-Dick\\". It proved appropriate to July 4 for many reasons as, in his study of Melville, Andrew Delblanco aptly describes \\"White-Jacket\\" as a \\"paean on behalf of democracy.\\"Melville: His World and WorkIt is that and more.Written in 1850, \\"White-Jacket\\" purports to describe Melville's own experiences when he shipped in 1843 as an \\"ordinary seaman on board of a United States frigate,then lying in a harbor of the Pacific Ocean.\\" Melville's voyage as a sailor lasted about 14 months as the ship sailed south around Cape Horn and then north in the Atlantic until ultimately reaching the United States where Melville was discharged. Melville calls the ship the \\"Neversink\\". It was a large sailing vessel, a man-of war, consisting of over 500 sailors and commanded by a captain, Captain Claret. There is also a Commodore on board the \\"Neversink\\" who commands a fleet. (At the time of the voyage, there were no admirals in the United States Navy.) Melville wrote \\"White Jacket\\" quickly and claimed he did not think highly of the book. In that judgment he seems to me mistaken.This is a lengthy book consisting of 90 short chapters written in a large, expansive almost bravura style. It does not have a continuous developed plot but rather is episodic in form. Melville describes in great detail life onboard the Neversink, and the people on board. He makes great use of the telling anecdote. \\"White Jacket\\" is also full of long passages of reflection about navy life and the ambiguities of human nature. In many places, the book becomes almost more a long essay than a novel.The book tells the story about an individual and about a world and microcosm. The book is narrated by \\"White-Jacket\\", and the reader never learns his name. The baggy white jacket the narrator wears and that give him his nickname frames many of his adventures as the jacket, together with the narrator's introspective, \\"meditative\\" disposition, separate him from most of his fellow sailors. As the book progresses, the white jacket subjects the narrator to ridicule at various times and, near the end of the book, almost becomes his shroud which leads to his death. After falling overboard from the mast, the narrator is able to cut off the old jacket to be rescued by the crew and return to a common humanity.Besides this individual component of the story, Melville uses the ship as a metaphor for diversity and for American life and democracy where good and evil and people of all backgrounds and positions are intermixed. There is a degree of cameraderie and freedom from the restraints of a 9 to 5 life (or its 1850 equivalent) onboard the Neversink. There are acts of heroism and strong, noble individuals, including particularly Jack Chase, Melville's superior on the mast whose praises are sung throughout the book. Melville dedicated his late final novel \\"Billy Budd\\" to Jack Chase.The strongest impression left by the book, however, is its criticism of excesses and cruelties in the Navy. In particular, \\"White Jacket\\" includes many passages and chapters about the punishment of flogging which was widely practiced on the Neversink under Captain Claret, an individual who is also shown as having good qualties. Melville offers graphic and repeated descriptions of flogging, including a description of how White Jacket himself fortunately and narrowly missed a severe flogging and of how an aged, revered sailor named Ushant received a flogging for disobeying an order of the Captain to trim his beard. Melville's book may have been a factor in an Act of Congress which outlawed flogging in the navy.Melville also describes the large degree of stratification in the Navy between the seamen, or \\"people\\" and the officer crew, from the Commodore and Captain,through the Lieutenants and the young dictatorial Midshipmen. The book recognizes the need for discipline and organization on a military vessel at sea. But Melville writes sharply about petty tyrannies of one person over another,about rigid social distinctions, and about unnecessary excessive, and harsh discipline. The backdrop to the book is American democracy with its many people and freedoms, but also its excesses and injustices, including the institution of slavery. Melville also is critical of many of his fellow sailors, with their ignorance, profligacy, smugglings and thefts, and violence. At the end of the book, Melville writes:\\"Oh, ahipmates and world-mates all round! we the people suffer many abuses. Our gun-deck is full of complaints. In vain from Lieutenants do we appeal to the Captain; in vain-- while on board our world-frigate-- to the indefinite Navy Commissioners, so far out of sight aloft. Yet the worst of our evils we blindly inflict upon ourselves; our officers can not remove them, even if they would. From the last ills no being can save another; therein each man must be his own saviour.\\"Besides constituting a \\"paean on behalf of democracy\\", \\"White-Jacket\\" has a more immediate relationship to the Fourth of July. Several chapters in the book describe the celebration of the holiday on board the Neversink. When the ship ran out of grog before the holiday, the ship's officers allowed the sailors to celebrate the day by performing a play or \\"theatrical\\". The men decked themselves in costumes and wrote, rehearsed, and performed their own drama called \\"The Old Wagon Paid Off!\\" starring none other than Jack Chase. During the July 4 performance, ship discipline was relaxed. With the exception of the Commodore and the Captain, the ship's officers attended the performance, and shared a spirit of brotherhood and fellowship. White-Jacket said \\"the unwonted spectacle of the row of gun-room oficers mingling with 'the people' in applauding a mere seaman like Jack Chase, filled me at the time with the most pleasurable emotions.\\" White Jacket continued:\\"Nor was it without similar pleasurable feelings that I witnessed the temporary rupture of the ship's stern discipline, consequent upon the tumult of the theatricals. I thought to myself, this now is as it should be. It is good to shake off, now and then, this iron yoke round our necks. And after having once permitted us sailors to be a little noisy, in a harmless way -- somewhat merrily turbulent -- the officers can not, with any good grace, be so excessively stern and unyielding as before.\\"Alas, rigourous discipline soon returned to the ship.In the story of the individual narrator, of life on the Neversink, and of the freedom and cameraderie of the theatrical on July 4, \\"White-Jacket\\" reminded me of the ideals celebrated in the United States on Independence Day.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"In this early title from the great Melville, we get an episodic account of the author's service aboard the USS United States, sister ship of \\"Old Ironsides.\\" To avoid prosecution under the Articles of War, the name of the ship (called in the book the \\"Neversink\\") and his fellow crew members have been changed, but the stories retain their often startlingly candid detail. From the ritual floggings at the masthead to a critical grog shortage, Melville gives us a seaman's eye view of life of the 400-man crew of an American man-of-war marooned uncomfortably in a time of peace.Each chapter is a commentary on some facet of life aboard the ship. Some are laden with irony and dry humor, others express thinly veiled outrage at an institution that completely deprives men of any form of liberty and justice as they work to protect the freedom of their country. In these chapters, you will also see the seeds of the themes and images that appeared in Melville's later works.\\"A blog,\\" you ask? That is exactly what this book is. There are many characters, no plot to speak of, but an incredibly rich garden of facts, opinions ideas and observations. It does little to flatter the U.S. Navy of the mid-1800's but provides a richly detailed and distinctly un-romanticized view of the lives of those who served. If you're a fan of Melville or just like books about sailing the seas, White Jacket is a must-read."},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Reading this book made me realize how much I have in common with the sailors of old in our illustrious Navy. We all hate general quarters. This book is a good read for anyone looking for a more indepth look at what naval life was/is like. Underways are long, port visits are short ( and more restricted than ever), and you never feel at home no matter where you go. Naval life is great but it isn't a adventurous as some writers tend to make it appear. To have adventures you must go it alone or pick a liberty buddy with similar ideas."},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"It's often said that, in 'Huckleberry Finn', \\"life is a river\\". 'White-Jacket', Herman Melville's fifth novel, may be his take on this: \\"the world is a ship\\". In fact, the subtitle of 'White-Jacket' is 'The World in a Man-of-War'. This is an interesting idea for an allegory and, in many ways, Melville suceeds. Using the events on the man-of-war Neversink, Melville draws many parallels to society in general and human justice in particular. Further, in the final chapter, Melville provides a moral to tie his allegory together.However, despite these successes, 'White-Jacket' pretty much fails as a novel. The main problem is that Melville exercises no control over his allegory. 'White-Jacket' contains far too much content that doesn't add to the allegory, and some of it clearly is not even meant to. While every word and chapter does not necessarily have to drive an allegory (unless you're Dante and writing something genius like 'The Divine Comedy'), the narrative that does not propel the allegory should have some point. Unfortunately, that is not the case here and it makes 'White-Jacket' pretty tedious.The excess material is especially frustrating because 'White-Jacket' quite simply tells no story. There is no plot, no character development, no conflict, nothing other than the allegory. So if a chapter doesn't fit in with the allegory, it really serves no purpose whatsoever! And, quite frankly, if Melville had honed his allegory the way he should have, his final chapter - which is terribly prosaic - would not have been required.Oddly, it seems to me that in writing his fourth, fifth, and sixth novels, Melville repeats the path he took with 'Typee', 'Omoo', and 'Mardi' (his first three). His fourth book ('Redburn') was like 'Typee', even though 'Typee' was more romantic and 'Redburn' darker. Both are quite successful works, tell a great story, and have clear themes communicated by those stories. 'Omoo' suffered from a directionless narrative that never came together as a story, very much like what we have with 'White-Jacket'. In his third book, Melville made an ambitious attempt at something deeper and, since his sixth book is 'Moby-Dick', the parallel seems to hold.I also found myself thinking of 'Redburn' and 'White-Jacket' as two halves of the whole that would become 'Moby-Dick'. 'Redburn' focuses on the story, and 'White-Jacket' focuses on an all-encompassing theme. In 'Moby-Dick', Melville would attempt both in a single novel. In addition, 'Moby-Dick''s theme of the microcosm echoes the 'world in a man-of-war' theme in 'White-Jacket'.Okay, all that said, is this a book worth reading? The answer is 'no', unless you're interested in delving into Melville's development as a writer or have an urge to learn in great detail what it was like to serve on a man-of-war in the 1800s. Bottom-line, in 'White-Jacket', Melville was overtly trying to write another 'tale of the sea' to earn money and regain the attention of his readers, while creating a deeper work 'under the radar'. However, the lack of plot means the book fails dismally as the former and the lack of control by Melville undermines the latter. 'White-Jacket' could have been much better, but Melville clearly needed more time, effort, and craft on this novel to realize this potential."},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"If you find yourself in a position where the individuals in authority over you are, in the actual state of affairs, your moral inferiors, then on this level alone you will be able to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"White jacket: Or, The world in a man-of-war (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"I feel quite strange presuming to give a numerical rating to a book by one of American literature's greatest authors.It's important for readers to realize that White-Jacket is not what would, in the modern day, be considered a novel. There is essentially no plot structure. It's a melange of events, descriptive passages and polemic, narrated by the eponymous White-Jacket, whom I suspect of being Melville himself. At times the book is entertainingly humorous - as when the narrator tries to get rid of his famous jacket. And much of the description of life aboard a man-of-war is fascinating -- the book would make a helpful companion for people reading modern novels such as O'Brian's series. (And, of course, White-Jacket probably was one of the sources used by O'Brian and other aquatic novelists.) The polemic -- Melville's rants against flogging and his pacifist pleas -- I found tiresome, as I always find polemic, regardless of its aims."},{"Title":"The Boss's Survival Guide","review":"As a student at the time of this writing, I have only been exposed to the employee's perspective.

That sexual harrassment can only occur between individuals that work for the same company (this is mentioned nowhere), and 2. What compensation would be due to a MAN that had been unfairly accused (and perhaps disciplined or fired)of sexual harrassment.

The University of Nebraska Press reprinted Frederick Manfred's novel in 1982. It is also available in various paperback editions.Although Manfred's account largely adheres to the actual historical event, he changed the names of the key characters. For example, Manfred's Cain Hammet replaces the actual Nate Champion that organized the small ranchers' Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Grower's Association (NWFSGA) to compete with the cattle barons' powerful Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA).The title of each chapter is a character - Cain, Dale, Harry, Rosemary (Rory), Hunt, Jesse, Mitch, and others. This structure allows the author to focus on characterization as well as on the action (confrontations, hangings, and ambushes). Manfred's shifting perspectives occasionally reveal deep misunderstandings and false assumptions made by both parties, although his account is largely sympathetic to the plight of the small ranchers.Cain Hammet is a reluctant protagonist. Link Keeler, the murderer of Cain's grandpa some years ago, has recently returned to Johnson County (under the name Hunt Larson) as a deputized inspector of cattle charged with eliminating rustling. Unable to goad Hunt into a gun fight, Cain lets his hated adversary walk away. While admittedly killing a peace officer would be foolhardy, Cain's inaction ultimately makes matters worse.Frederick Manfred's Riders of Judgment was the basis for the 2002 TV movie The Johnson County War.Caution: In 2001 another respected Western author, Ralph Compton, published a novel with the same title, Riders of Judgment, that is also based on the Johnson County range war.

The history professor at Columbia University would ultimately win 2 Pulitzer Prizes before dying at the age of 54 in 1970.The point Hofstadter consistently made is how important pragmatic considerations were in the evolution of the great political shakers and movers of American political annals. He rejects the view of historian Charles Beard and others about the impact of economic determinism in the foundation and shaping of early America. Hofstadter does not discount its impact, but cites the pragmatic necessity of studious compromise involving the interests of important American sociological groups which were often disparate, such as the manufacturing interests of the north and the rural farming interests of the south, as well as slavery and anti-slavery interests. The need for compromise influenced Thomas Jefferson in constructing a U.S. Constitution, which relied on the separation powers doctrine of English philosopher John Locke and that of separation of powers advanced by French social scientist Montesquieu.The chapter on Franklin Delano Roosevelt is fascinating as a study in political pragmatism. Roosevelt ran on a Democratic Party platform for 1932 which rivals one of the most conservative doctrines ever put on paper by an American political party. He initially criticized incumbent President Herbert Hoover for spending too much money in dealing with the Depression and its related effects. Once in office he changed his mind and forged a government activist agenda embraced by progressive reformers.Abraham Lincoln is studied in detail as well within the framework of a very astute political figure with his eye squarely on success in that arena from the beginning, where the \\"railsplitter\\" image played well with voters. He purposely straddled the fence on the slavery issue since there was much controversy surrounding the issue even within the fledgling Republican Party which he joined after the Whig Party folded, despite its reputation for being an essentially anti-slavery party.Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson are evaluated as two important political figures who perpetually juggled conservative basic instincts against the need they believed existed for certain progressive systemic reforms. For Roosevelt this meant anti-trust legislation and conservation, while Wilson, whose traditional Virginia conservative roots left him unwilling to budge in the field of race relations, nonetheless undertook mighty electoral reforms embraced by William Jennings Bryan and the populist movement. Bryan is another figure covered in the book.The chapter of Herbert Hoover is also fascinating. Hofstadter envisioned him as the last of the laissez-faire American presidents. In the wake of the great upheavals occurring in America, particularly related to the Great Depression, a political pragmatism later advanced by Roosevelt to stem the tide of unrest was eschewed by Hoover."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN POLITICAL TRADITION","review":"The classic story of American History, as told by Richard Hofstadter, has rightly come to be thought of as a masterpiece of American history since its original publication in 1948. This well deserved reputation comes from the rich storytelling, attention to detail, and thoughtful and complete narrative Hofstadter puts forward in this book.Hofstadter takes as his guide one figure from each generation starting from the beginning of the Republic, and through biographical sketch describes both the historical figure and the time period he is depicting. Beginning with Jefferson and including people such as Jackson, Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt, Hofstadter demonstrates how a combination of the great men and the times they lived in shaped what have come down to us as the leading tradition in American politics: the belief in American greatness, individualism, and compassion.The most significant contribution of this book is to show how these men, who have come down to us as legendary and nearly mythological figures were very much political animals. Just like Bill Clinton and George Bush make decisions today based on political calculation, so to do Lincoln and Jefferson. That these men were not demigods but in fact mere humans makes their achievements that much more incredible."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN POLITICAL TRADITION","review":"This wonderful book fills a hole in American history that's been open too long. Instead of treating great figures as saints or unapproachable geniuses Hofstadter gives a realistic picture of what they believed and what they stood for. More than that he points to the philosophic and cultural continuity that these figures embodied, struggled with, and sometimes redefined. It's as much about how the greater American view on work and indivdualism evolved from the founding as about the men who made it. Also, kind of inadvertantly, the author weaves in a history of the American liberal idea and how Jeffersonian liberalism stressing free markets, small business, and individualism, was transformed into New Deal liberalism. He argues that the transformation wasn't a betrayal but was instead a development based on necessary responses to an economically and socially changing world.

It tends to sacrifice historical accuracy for political proselytizing. Howard Zinn's &quot;Peoples' History of the United States&quot; is a case in point: almost everything Zinn says seems dedicated to supporting the author's left-wing agenda.Hofstadter's book neatly transcends this problem. It is most definitely revisionist. Each chapter examines a different American political leader, with a great deal of in-depth detail and criticism. However, Hofstadter escapes the political trap of mentioning only the negative or only the positive points about his subjects. Both sides are always examined in detail.This evenhandedness results in a very interesting and useful text. Rather than heroes and villains, our past politicians come across as human beings, and very interesting ones at that.A choice history text, both detailed and objective."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN POLITICAL TRADITION","review":"Richard Hofstadter, late professor at Columbia University, launched the Consensus school of history with his book, The American Political Tradition, and the Men Who Made It.

If the writer were living today, he would undoubtely have included John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, William F. Buckley and Ross Perot. In other words, each period had a particular individual that stood out and influenced many other thinkers, the public , and politicians. This book is really what history is all about, events shaping men and men shaping events. It is historical analysis; and it shows why reading and studying history is an exercise worth doing."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN POLITICAL TRADITION","review":"This marvelous series of essays on American leaders made Richard Hofstadter's reputation as one of the most important young historians in the country during the late-1940's. Professor Hofstadter took on this assignment at a very early age. He was only 28 years old when he started this book, now a bit of a cult classic in American history, and finished it when he was 32. In spite of his youth, he clearly had fully formed opinions on what drives American politics. Hofstadter throws new lights on American history in a series of twelve finely-drawn portraits, mostly of Presidents but one of a stern moralist, Wendell Phillips, and one of a constantly disappointed Presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan.In each of these sketches, all masterful in their unique viewpoints and careful analytical approach, Hofstadter sees similarities that quickly bubble to the surface. In all of them, the consistent struggle is that of the conflict between differing views of economic organization. That is the prism through which Hofstadter constructs his view of American political development. In all of this, we are treated to a great ride through our nation's history from an historian who refuses to tell the familiar story but reaches for an understanding of how opinions change over time.Jefferson, the great Virginia aristocrat, is as clear and eloquent as any of the founders in his defense of the common man, both his rights and his liberties. But of course Jefferson's love of liberty had its clear limits: he was a lifelong slaveowner and almost assuredly the father of one of his slave's children. Andrew Jackson struggles for the common man, dismantling the Bank of the United States, but Hofstadter reminds us that Jackson's early days were spent defending the rights of the propertied class.John C. Calhoun is presented as the most artful defender of slavery, an institution that had, apart from its heinous and inexcusable human consequences, the effect of sharply reducing the cost of labor in cotton farming, a highly labor-intensive industry. We see the emerging clash between the North and the South as an economic argument. Curiously, Calhoun is also presented as a Unionist but he wanted a special kind of Union, one dominated by the South not the North. Here again, Hofstadter's take on Calhoun presents him in a quite different light than the most portraits of the Great Nullifier.It is Hofstadter's analysis of Lincoln that most arrests the attention of any student of American history. Hofstadter calls the Emancipation Proclamation not much more than a \\"bill of lading\\". It called for emancipation not because slavery was wrong but only that the emancipation of the slaves was required for \\"military necessity\\". Only those slaves in the disloyal Southern states were to be freed. Slaves in the loyal Border States were not touched by the Proclamation. His hesitation to fully address the moral wrongness of slavery is based on electoral politics, according to Hofstadter. The most important source of Lincoln's electoral strength was centered in the Midwestern (then referred to as \\"Northwestern\\") parts of the country, where voters feared that the institution of slavery, if it spread to other parts of the country, would depress wages and result in more intense competition for jobs. It was not the moral wrongness of slavery that Lincoln initially appealed to but to a more convincing economic argument. Nevertheless, Hofstadter eventually focuses on Lincoln's slow turn to the abolition of slavery in all parts of the country. But we are left with a portrait of Lincoln, probably our greatest president, that is at times frustratingly nuanced.Hofstadter's discussion of the emerging strand of progressivism in American politics develops slowly. The post-Civil War period was perhaps the most dynamic period of industrial development in the nation's history. Only by the end of the nineteenth century did the voice of the common man find its full volume. William Jennings Bryan was this voice but his career never achieved its full potential. Bryan, three times the nominee of the Democratic party, failed in his most important quest: to change the monetary system of the country from one based on gold to a more accomodating system. Hofstadter's discussion of Bryan is a sad interlude between the magnificence of Lincoln and the emergence of Theodore Roosevelt.This is perhaps the most puzzling of Hofstadter's portraits. Roosevelt is here presented as a conservative. He opposes bills to raise the salaries of police and civil employees. He guards against the potential violence of labor strikes and urges firing live bullets at striking workers, if necessary. He enters the Presidency with no strong position on the problems caused by corporate power. In fact, as Hofstadter relates, he admits \\"I have let up in every case where I have had any possible excuse for doing so.\\" One is left with the impression, very much encouraged by Hofstadter, that Teddy was far more noise than substance. This is in stark contrast to recent biographies of Teddy; wanted to read a fuller exposition of Hofstadter's take on Roosevelt, particularly in view of the now widely-celebrated Part Three of Edmund Morgan on Roosevelt, an expansive but ultimately hagiographic study.The final two portraits (excepting a brief piece on the immensely talented but woefully inept Herbert Hoover) are perhaps the most interesting, since they touch on issues that have emerged in the present decade.Both Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt had clear conceptions of the use of governmental power to influence events. Wilson turned from a highly successful career as a college president to politics, almost as an afterthought. He came from an intensely conservative background, as did Roosevelt, and brought with him highly conventional views. Hofstadter traces the gradual movement of Wilson, first as a governor and then as President, towards more progressive positions, ones that infuriated business interests. He instituted the income tax, created the Federal Reserve, reduced the tariff (the first significant reduction since the Civil War), and extended control over big business with the Clayton Anti-Trust Act. Resentment against Wilson became white-hot as a result of this. This loss of trust enabled the Republican party to defeat the League of Nations treaty, a world structure that Wilson felt would be his most signal achievement. It ended badly for Wilson and Hofstadter sums it up acutely: \\"He said that American entrance to the war would be a world calamity, and led the nation in...He said the future... of the world depended on removing the economic causes of war, and did not attempt even to discuss these causes at the Peace Conference.\\" Here it is again: economics rules, according to Hofstadter.Finally, it is Franklin Roosevelt's turn for the Hofstadter lens. Here, he is at his most critical. Not only does Roosevelt seem to be nave and practically disinterested in economic policy but he fails miserably in restoring the American economy, lurching from one unsuccessful program to another. Only with the run-up to World War does the American economy respond to governmental intervention. By now, after eleven portraits, each of which offers a different slant on the most prominent American political figures, Hofstadter's reservations about Roosevelt seem predictable and a bit forced. Nevertheless, Hofstadter's overall point is well-served: the American Political Tradition is one of compromise, constant tacking to catch the wind, shifting to capture the mood of the electorate, and growth as broader perspectives become more visible.In all of this, Hofstadter seems to be saying that important questions are ultimately decided by society's attempt to move towards a middle ground, one where the scales of opinion reach equilibrium. He does this with a series of portraits, each of which illustrate the process of political movement. Not surprisingly, economics has determined most of the important issues of our history. Hofstadter's book is deeply satisfying and constantly interesting. It may not be the easiest read in American history but it is one of the most important."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN POLITICAL TRADITION","review":"The cover is in bad condition, and some pages are as if they had water on it.

In order to achieve the first goal, Hofstadter uses a trick familiar to every gadfly and pickle barrel orator; he simply argues the opposite of the accepted wisdom. Thus, his chapter headings include: I. The Founding Fathers: an Age of Realism; II. Thomas Jefferson: the Aristocrat as Democrat; III. Andrew Jackson and the Rise of Liberal Capitalism; IX. Theodore Roosevelt: the Conservative as Progressive; and X. Woodrow Wilson: the Conservative as Liberal. Get it? The Founders weren't idealists but realists. The liberal icons of the Left--Jefferson, Jackson, TR and Wilson--were actually all conservatives. This continues right up to FDR, who despite a brief and half-hearted break from this past, refuses to go along with the most farsighted and sweeping aspects of the New Deal. As this version of American history unfolds, we're treated to a kind of grand conspiracy theory whereby the leaders of the Left turn out to be wolves in sheep's clothing, secretly supporting the system and channeling discontent back into heterodoxy.Then comes the hammer blow, because do you know what all of these schemers and dupes, either naively or maliciously, preached and believed in? As Hofstadter scornfully informs us, all of them believed in individualism, free markets, competition, equality of opportunity and all of those hoary old shibboleths that had been totally discredited by 1948 and would surely never again see the light of day:The things Hoover believed in--efficiency, enterprise, opportunity, individualism, substantial laissez-faire, personal success, material welfare--were all in the dominant American tradition. The ideas he represented--ideas that to so many people made him seem hateful or ridiculous after 1929--were precisely the same ideas that in the remoter past of the nineteenth century and the more immediate past of the New Era had an almost irresistible lure for the majority of Americans. In the language of Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln these ideas had been fresh and invigorating; in the language of Herbert Hoover they seemed stale and oppressive. It is a significant fact that in the crisis of the thirties the man who represented these conceptions found himself unable even to communicate himself and what he stood for. Almost overnight his essential beliefs had become outlandish and unintelligible. The victim of his faith in the power of capitalism to survive and prosper without gigantic government props, Hoover was the last presidential spokesman of the hallowed doctrines of laissez-faire liberalism, and his departure from Washington marked the decline of a great tradition.Hofstadter later asks of Hoover: &quot;Could he have seriously believed that free enterprise might be restored to the postwar world?&quot; This is what we mean when we speak of hubris in Greek tragedy. It would be amusing if Hofstadter and his ilk had not proceeded to do so much harm with their abandonment of American values and traditions and their eager embrace of a centralized planned economy. It's really too bad that he died so young. I'd have liked to have seen him explain away the rise of Ronald Reagan and the Opportunity Society.This book is profoundly awful. It is wrong in its major theses, informed by a really snide tone of self congratulation and, in celebrating the worst moment in the history of American governance (the rise of the Social Welfare State), fails to reckon with the fundamental tension in American history (indeed in all of human history), the ongoing struggle between the forces of freedom and the advocates of security. I don't doubt that this book was influential, and in that sense great, but to call it one of the best nonfiction books of the century is to abuse truth, defile common sense and elevate partisan political loyalties over clear eyed analysis.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN POLITICAL TRADITION","review":"This book was very biased and did not tell the reader the whole concerning the actualities of the time...so I believe that this book does not deserve to ever be printed again...it just tells the autrocities that the people performed, so i dont think that this book was very good!"},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"After the absolutely amazing 'Lord of the Barnyard', i went into this book hoping for the best and, admittedly, expecting the worst. What i got was much closer to the former than the latter, but still this book is as nothing compared to Egolf's first book. I would definitely recommend this if you're not looking for too much meaning in a book. it's one of the most fun reads i've had in a long time, and it only took me one night, so if you're strapped for time, you've got a winner. however, i can't write this review without stating that Tristan Egolf's first book is the finest piece of literature i've ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"Over all I believe this Novel was one step below Lord of the Barnyard, but the sole reason is the length of the book. If you liked Lord of the Barnyard then you will love this as well, you will also be let down with how short it is.Fortunately for Egolf fans that is the only flaw I really see in this book, I partially expected a sophomore slump, especially with the long wait for this release. But no, it held all the wit and humor that Barnyard held.With such mediocrity in lit now a days, I dearly hope egolf continues to write, and is right now hard at work for a third novel... I just hope it doesn't take 4 years for his next one."},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"This book was my introduction to Egolf who is an interesting writer. At times this was so hip, I really wasn't sure what was going on. Charlie is a half Cambodian, half black, alcoholic violin virtuoso whose gigs fall through and decides to live in a flop house. He works at a deli and moonlights bashing rats in the sewer on a pay per carcass basis. He buddies up with his friend sometimes called Tinsel, sometimes called Greetz, who does not believe in bathing or cleaning, calls himself an anarchist, and dreams of robbing a bank someday. After several spurts of bad behavior, the guys meet up with Louise Gascoyne, a wealthy jetset reporter who circles the globe looking for danger. She lures the guys out to an elegant restaurant, dresses them in Armani, gets Tinsel to take a bath, and then suffers from crabs which she extracts from the anarchist. The boys create havoc for a movie crew filming just outside of the upscale hotel as Charlie falls for Louise. Escaping through the lobby, Tinsel steals Louise's purse and camera. To get back at him, Charlie goes back and robs the deli, steals their truck, and sets up Tinsel to rob a bank as revenge. It's a fast-paced, improbable, but quite fun romp, filled with lunacy. We don't really get a sense of character which is sacrificed for the witty barrage of dialogue and the ambiance of the street. Eglof handles dialogue exceptionally well. Maybe the sequel will allow us to know the characters' motivating force. This one goes down quick and sweet. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"This book is, above all else, very catching. I saw it while I was browsing at my local bookstore and started to read the first page. I had a great deal of trouble checking myself and remembering to buy the book instead of just reading the whole thing standing there. With moments of both insanity and downright strangeness, this book entertains from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"I have just finished _Skirt and the Fiddle_, and in doing so I have read all three of the published novels of the late, lamented Tristan Egolf. I have been able to ascertain by my reading two equally valid, yet mutually exclusive conclusions about this work. 1) It is the best book by this particular author 2) It is the worst book by this particular author.Now, normally I would try to defend both positions here, but I'll let that slide. The evaluation of a text is so subjective anyway; I will leave it up to you to decide. Not much happens in the story, but then a lot of little things happen as Egolf tells his tale again of an interesting low man brought lower yet redeemed (Think _A Confederacy of Dunces_).However, there were a couple of things that I found interesting. He leaves a little nugget in a reference to the plot of his earlier novel, _The Lord of the Barnyard_. I like this post-modern slip of self-referentiality when it is not overdone when the tales are otherwise unrelated. Also, interestingly, he calls out his future text _Kornwolf_, which is something that would get fuller treatment as a thematic element if this were an academic paper I didn't want to write.Stylistically, this book is one I called a gonzo collaboration of Hunter Thompson and David Foster Wallace. From my point of view that is a beautiful and dammed praise, as DFW's work is alienating and unpleasing to me. However, this alienation is avoided by Egolf; he is more humane and approachable. I wish he were still working and bringing beauty to this world."},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"Tristan Egolf's Lord of The Barnyard was what modern lit badly needed someone not obsessed with overly perfect prose and crystal clear simple sentences. I worried the follow up would be a disappointment. Skirt in The Fiddle is a fun swift read with a main character-Charlie who is duped into accepting a gig playing for a band called Volstagg defined by Egolf as \\"corporate-Satanic Limburger metal\\" and abandons his violin playing ending up in a flophouse. He also ends up bagging rats through the sewers for money-he is paid by the rat just an example of the way Egolf finds the oddball in the oridinary. Another example of Egolf's prose is a line on page 55 \\"watching him yak and prattle\\" this is what I enjoyed about Egolf's writing these fun sentences and clever witty prose not just dry and informative language. This a nice comical romp."},{"Title":"Skirt and the Fiddle","review":"I loved Lord of the Barnyard. This was not good, plain and simple. The chapters didn't connect with each other, therefore a coherent story was never formed. Another problem is that you never really care about the characters.

The Dalton gang clearly divides into two seemingly armed camps, who loathe each other. The \\"Swamp\\" Daltons and the \\"Society\\" Daltons do not allow a happy event to interfere with their long standing feud. Though not an invitee, Foley's former wife arrives to cause even more desolation and destruction among Charlotte's side of the gathering group. All that wrangling seems like mere child's play when a murder occurs. Amateur sleuth Claire, who has helped in prior homicide investigations, cannot resist sleuthing.SHIVAREE is a humorous amateur sleuth cozy that provides readers with interesting, spiteful, and badmouthing characters ready to orally assassinate someone else. The lead protagonists remain a warm couple (see BEHIND ECLAIRE'S DOOR) and their best friends deserve a nicer ceremony.

He carefully examines the origins and history of the gospel traditions from the lifetime of Jesus to the appearance of the written gospels.Gerhardsson's viewpoint is that the primary setting for the early Christian transmission of the Jesus tradition is the tradition itself. This tradition must be understood as a conscious, technical art of instruction. Acknowledging the creative character of early Christian interpretations, Gerhardsson upholds that \\"it is one thing to take these changes in the transmitted material in all seriousness, and quite another thing to presume that the early church freely constructed the Jesus traditions, placed the words of early Christian prophets and teachers in Jesus' mouth, and so on.\\"The Origins of the Gospel Traditions presents a Scandinavian alternative to classical continental form-criticism in biblical studies. It provides students of the Bible with a summary of a significant perspective not previously available in English.Birger Gerhardsson is Professor of the New Testament at the University of Lund, Sweden and the author of 'Memory and Manuscript' and 'Tradition and Transmission in Early Christianity'.\\"My review:1. This review based on Hardback edition, English translation, 1979.2. The author states his difference with form-critical scholars \\"whom I agree with in part, but in part differ from - is their work is not sufficiently historical.\\" Pg.8. Throughout this presentation he makes an argument that, in particular, Dibelius and especially Bultmann take the form-critical approach past reasonable limits, and thereby accuses them of denying the basic truth of the Gospel message. He claims they do this because \\"their work is not sufficiently historical\\" and that the lack of their historical anchoring is due to an inadequate understanding of the process of \\"how holy, authoritative tradition was transmitted in the Jewish milieu of Palestine and elsewhere at the time of the New Testament.\\" Pgs. 8-9.3. This is a small book: only 85 pages of text. There are no endnotes, and only some 26 footnotes, and these containing only reference and not content.4. Gerhardsson is a true believer in: Jesus was divine, did work miracles, and was physically resurrected.5. Gerhardsson is a true scholar: \\"It thus seems historically very probable that the Jesus traditions in the Gospels have been preserved for us by men both reliable and well informed. But even one who has come to this point of view sees directly in our Gospels that the Jesus traditions must have undergone certain changes on the way from Jesus to the different evangelists. If one places the three Synoptic versions side by side - that is, by looking in a synopsis - one can see immediately how they differ from one another. It is thus uncontestable that changes took place in this material in the process of its transmission (as well as in that of its final redaction).\\" Pg. 81.6. The detail of his analysis is not presented here, and he asks readers to refer to his major works (see dust jacket summary presented above). Nonetheless, some interesting and important details of analysis are presented, and they are woven into the discussion in an effort to support his major thesis of transmission accuracy. The entire book is \\"lecture form\\" that \\"consists of a series of lectures presented in March 1976\\". This explains the lack of scholarly detail.7.

If you're one of those people who like your sci-fi in an hour TV show where everything is wrapped up neatly for you at the end of the hour, so you don't have to bother to think very much, then this is probably NOT the book for you.That said, I loved this book for being brave enough to be unconventional. Bartolomeo, the narrator, paints a broad picture of life on the Argonos, a ship wandering the universe for centuries. History, sociology, and religion are all explored in his description of the society and bureaucracy on the Argonos. Bartolomeo wants to be devoted to his captain, embroiled in a power struggle with the church (who else?), but the social structure where the privileged few profit from the labor of the masses ultimately disturbs him. He is also distracted by his feelings (one couldn't really call it a romance) for Father Veronica, a female priest who ends up with him on the exploration team.All of this becomes moot as the Argonos comes across first a massacred colony and then an alien spaceship that may or may not be responsible for it. The editorial review quote demonstrates just a bit of the horror and shock of the exploration crew that finds the remains of the colony. For the most part, though, the suspense is the exploration of the alien ship: it appears to be deserted, yet it is constructed oddly and even threateningly, and strange &quot;accidents&quot; and &quot;illnesses&quot; keep occurring among the crew. Yet this book never descends to the &quot;jump out and say boo&quot; level of B-movie aliens. It is mostly subtlety, which will keep you guessing until the end, and maybe even after.A final word: one of the reviews below that says it won't give away too much about the story TELLS YOU ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAPPENS!!!

Everyone's on a spaceship bound for nowhere, nobody knows where it came from or why its going on. The Roman Catholic church (why are science fiction authors obsessed with the RC church, think of Dan Simmons's Hyperion/Endymion books? Is it the ceremonial nature and centuries of hidden intrigues of established Christianity?)is up to no good and, although it has finally gotten around to allowing women to become priests, is running an alternative power structure to that of the existing &quot;government&quot; of the space ship, which is a government of privileged occupants living on the fruits of the labor of a wretched and resentful underclass of inhabitants.Everything gets called into question when the spaceship encounters signs of nonhuman life and an alien spaceship that is either a deserted wreck or a deadly trap. How the ship's people and institutions respond to the challenge is a fascinating story and the way events unfold is riveting in Russo's narrative.The final quarter of this book is unforgettably riveting and terrifying. I couldn't put it down and doubt that any reasonably attentive reader would be able to.The end is more of a stop than a conclusion, but this is common in the genre. Perhaps there is a sequel on the way.This is a superb book.

I was about a third of the way through when I realized it was a different author. No matter - I was enjoying this story so much that I kept on reading, finishing the book in a day. This is the type of sci fi I like - more of a social cultural look at our future rather than dependance on hardware, with many themes that we are still tackling today. Fast paced story, well written, with interesting characters and dilemmas. Now I want to search for more of this writer's books."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I first picked up this book years ago close to release, but the negative things said about it have persuaded me to defend it.This is by far one of the best sci fi books I have read, ever. It remains completely personal and never becomes a chore to read. You will find little to get bogged down by, as the writing moves incredibly fast. It's greatest stregnth is it's charecters, all held together by intertwining motives, ideals, and conflicts.Don't let some of the negative reviews fool you, this is magnificent. I've read quite a lot about the dissatisfaction with the ending, and I am baffled. Everything that needs to have an end, does. At the risk of spoilers, this novel is about these charecters and the ship they inhabit. At the end, that story is finished. The ship is gone, the threat of an alien race, gone. What charecters do make it out of the ship are going to a new chapter of their lives. Many of them have had their lives changed by an unforgettable experience, and now they are moving on to the next.While it is true that you never find out some things, they are hardly things that seem important. Do the aliens need a motive? Do we need to know more about the Church's plot to overthrow the current ruling body? Do we need to see the final fate of the captain? Do we need to see what's on those video moniters? Do we need to see the return to Antioch?I think not. Nearly every \\"unresolved\\" issue in this book are issues that the reader creates for themselves; not the author. Our own desire to know more, that hunger for knowledge and power, is the roots of our destruction and one of the mainy strong points of this book.That being said, none of these issues in question are necessary to the primary focus, and that's why I was surprised at the disdain for the ending.The conflicts that have been going on between the charecters and the primary plot lines of both the political uprisings and the alien ship ARE resolved at the end of the story.Even if by some chance you are unhappy with the brilliant end, you will still have read one of the most engaging and thought provoking novels in a long time. It is beautifully written, and you cannot go wrong.At the very least, pick it up and try it.You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"The Argonas is a gigantic spaceship that houses thousands of people while visiting different galaxies. The residents on board have lived on the ship for generations and have lost sight of their original mission or who even built the craft. Inside the ship, is a city structure with two classes of people: the ruling oligarchy and the downsiders who provide forced manual labor. The latter have no rights or freedoms.The travelers have not touched down in a planet in twelve years, but now receive a signal from a place capable of sustaining life. The leaders decide to explore the planet. Humans once colonized Antioch, but when the visitors arrive they find the horrible site of numerous skeletons hanging from hooks in an alien-like chamber. They flee rather quickly, but soon stumble across an alien space ship as big as their own. No one seems aboard as members of the Argonas explore the vessel, unaware of that they have let loose on their own population.Space opera was never quite like this tale. Anyone who were enthralled by the aliens from the movie Alien will love Richard Paul Russo's latest masterpiece, SHIP OF FOOLS. The title is appropriate. The author creates a shocker of an ending that no one could have predicted, probably not even the author when he was drafting the novel. Even the day-to-day details of life on the spaceship seem fascinating as readers are simply hooked by a wonderful plot that would make a powerful movie.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Richard Paul Russo here tackles two of science fiction's hoarier scenarios: The generation starship, and the mysterious alien ship which no one can understand. Although he writes a more engaging story than some of his predecessors (e.g., Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, and John E. Stith's Reckoning Infinity), he doesn't pull it off.The book is most interesting in exploring how the good ship Argyros works. The political machinations and tensions among the factions, the sense of sameness - if not ennui - which pervades their society, and occasional moments of desperation and revolt.Unfortunately he sets this against a backdrop of the aforementioned mysterious alien ship, with the twist that the ship appears related to a dead colony on a nearby world, and is, well, far from safe to explore. As such Russo sets out to paint yet another picture of aliens so alien and mysterious that we can't understand them. Such stories are never satisfying, because when the aliens' (or perhaps their ship's) behavior is the centerpiece of the book, we need to eventually be told SOMETHING about them. Why are they behaving as they are? Why are they sitting in the middle of space, silent? Why are the rooms constructed the way they are? It's not that we need all the answers hand-delivered, but we need to be given something, and we're not. We can't even draw our own conclusions because there's nothing there to draw from. Worse, one is left with the strong impression that Russo himself doesn't even have an idea as to what it's all about.The story ends up being - sort of - about how humans react to such an encounter, but the alien ship is so generic it's not even up to the level of, say, 2001, and the ending seems all-too-predicable, ultimately. The religious and spiritual overtones are not without interest, but they're at best the third-most-interesting element of the book and cannot carry it.I suspect that I'll barely remember the details of this book a year from now, although I enjoyed it for most of the ride. Chalk it up as another novel which could have been much better than it is, if it had had a firmer direction."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Brilliant book, great story and thoughtful subjects. This book intends to cause much thinking in the reader. If you are desiring a book to lead (link) you from point A to point B to point C, etc., you might try something else...like Grisham. The subjects are intentionally not solved for you, no silver platter, no ribbon and bow.Instead, you get a believable world (on a ship - a big ship), with real people (the protagonist wears prosthetic body armour), in some terrible situations, some of their own making. This is not black and white writing, nor is it shades of gray; it is technicolor. The faceless Hollywood science fiction movies fail to tell stories as engaging, fresh and as interesting as this one.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Richard Paul Russo's latest work, Ship of Fools, is as much a philosophical exploration-or simply a mood piece-as it is a tale of fiction. As always, Russo breathes a gritty authenticity into the people, places, and social system of Ship of Fools. Unfortunately, the book fails to fall neatly into any conventional science fiction niche. Not heroic enough for space opera, not intense enough for horror, not comprehensive enough as a dystopian treatise, and not revealing enough as a tale of alien contact, the book is stylish and thought-provoking but raises more questions than it attempts to answer and sets up more potential story lines than it bothers to pursue. Fans expecting something like Russo's Carlucci books, or relying too much on the back-cover synopsis or reviewers' quotes, are likely to end up disappointed. Readers who enjoy observing how a master writer creates and manipulates the fabric of a story, or exploring their own beliefs and tenets through the thoughts of others, will find the book rich indeed.The human generation ship Argonos has been in space for hundreds of years. Its original purpose is murky. Its aging mechanical systems are gradually falling apart. Its tightly closed social system consists of a working class which performs the labor necessary to keep machines and society functioning, and a ruling class which peripherally includes ship's crew and clergy. Tensions are running high between classes and among the various ruling class factions.Argonos picks up a radio signal from a nearby planet. At this point, the ship really needs a habitable world in order to re-provision if nothing else. An exploration party finds the planet habitable but no longer inhabited. A cache of grisly human remains among a cluster of strange buildings hints at an alien menace, but no records can be found to explain what has happened.When the transmitter that drew Argonos to the planet begins sending out a different signal, the ship's leaders decide to follow up. This takes Argonos to another vast starship, clearly alien and apparently derelict. Teams are sent to systematically investigate the vessel, thus leading to the story's climax.Russo's main themes are evil, particularly the evil outside versus the evil within; nobility, duty, or whatever else provides the motivation for people to rise above self-interest and serve a greater cause; and how a closed society breeds lifestyle abnormalities along with genetic abnormalities. Russo's characters directly or indirectly question God, the status quo, the value of individual lives, and man's place in the universe in general, with varying degrees of resolution before the tale's end. Ship of Fools provides no big, emotionally satisfying payoff, but offers an absorbing read nevertheless."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I'm disappointed to read some of the reviews of this book which state that it's a letdown and that it doesn't have a tidy resolution. Clearly these are the type of people who like Americanized versions of foreign movies, where all the loose ends are tied up for you nicely, instead of making you think. This book has great characters and is more suspenseful than any book I've read in a very long time. If you like your books compelling and thought provoking, give this a shot. If you want a fantasy sci-fi book that's the equivalent of a tv sitcom, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I find it very hard to really pin down this book. I have recently re-read it and I did the exact same thing that I did the first time I read it two years ago. That is, I got so involved in it that I read almost of it at one sitting and as soon as I was done with it, I began searching the web for any hint of a sequel. I think Russo is just sitting back laughing at me, the big weasel.The story is, to me anyway, absolutely riveting. Russo paints his story with a master's brush. You not only have the suspense of a truly enigmatic first contact with an alien species, but also a growing insurrection on the human space ship with all the accompanying drama. The two stories run parallel to one another until the alien contact develops to overshadow the problems of the human.The story ends up with a lot of un-answered questions but, I felt like the book has just enough meat and gives just enough answers to keep me interested until after the last page. The big problem is that \`after' part there. I could really have used a few hundred more pages, or better yet a sequel.If you are the sort of reader who thinks Graphic Novels are \\"deep\\" and that Douglas Adams is heavy reading, you will want to skip this one. But, if you are the sort of person who doesn't need to have everything explained to you and realizes that, ultimately, a lot of life's questions aren't answered, then this is the book for you.Read it, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This book won the 2001 Philip K. Dick award, and that tells me two things. First, 2001 must have been a monstrously poor year for Science Fiction. And even given that, (second:) the standards of this award have become perilously low. I'll come back to that in the end of my review. I'm still furious that I wasted time and money on this book, and I want to convey this in my review, too.It's hard to make my point clear while not giving one or the other hint on how the story plot is developping. It's not that the publishers would mind, they didn't ask the Wikipedia guys to remove their plot synopsis - but I don't want to spoil the reading \\"fun\\" for those who are still willing to buy this ... effort.The plot is not rich enough for a novel and would have been more adequate for a short story - but that isn't even my point of criticism. You could say that the author inflates a short story to a novel, but at least that he's doing extremely well: the characters are well done, deep, rich and credible, their relationships are complex and elaborate, the places are well drawn and engaging, and the story plot is quite convincing, at least for the first three quarters of the book, where it is logical, coherent and psychologically probable. So, for the first and greatest part of the book, this is actually really good literature (or one great bore for a not-literary-minded hard core SciFi fan...).An especially strong point of the book is the depiction of the complexity of relations and politics on the generation ship. For the main plot, it would ultimately have been sufficient to reduce all that to a simple, Star-Trek-like chain of command, but Russo took the pains to elaborate the ship's society, and succeeded. For some dozen pages you could even think that this is going to be the main theme of \\"Ship of Fools\\", the ship being a timeless symbol of human society and history itself. It's good and thoughtful, it's a memorable achievement.Another strong point is the treatment of religion. Russo manages to avoid the simplistic pitfall of setting stupid, evil fundamentalists vs. good iconoclastic rationalists. Instead, he treats the topic in a thoughtful, intelligent and well-balanced manner, and integrates it neatly into the overall framework of the plot. Also here, the book is a rather good read, and I commend it for that.So what went wrong?The main plot starts when the generation ship reaches the planet Antioch, finds that it had already been settled by humans, and discovers the gruesome fate of the settlers - just as it is hinted at in the book's flap text. By now, the author has presented us with a complex and interesting story background, engaging characters, a shocking revelation and a mystery that yearns for a solution on an intellectual and literary level worthy of its exposition. That's exactly what the reader has the right to expect when the ship leaves the planet and has an ... encounter soon afterwards. Even there, the author continues to build up expectations and a sense of mystery.Now there is a promise here, given to the reader by the author. Just imagine a crime novel that received, let's say, the Agatha-Christie-Awart (if that exists). It starts out with everything done right by the author, just like in \\"Ship of Fools\\", and at first you get the impression that whatever twist the plot is going to take, in the end you'll be presented with a worthy ending, a deeply philosophical, intellectually surprising and truly memorable solution to the central mystery of the plot. But it's horse manure you'll get. In the end it was the gardener, and you might have suspected that all along, but who would have thought that the book is going to be that stupid after all! And it was not just the gardener, it's also that he did it just because he's that sick and evil kind of person you'll only find in third rate direct-to-video crime movies. The kind who'll get their behinds kicked by Jean-Claude van Damme. There's NOTHING MORE BEHIND IT, he's not really a character, just a MacGuffin, and that's all. All! That's how the story ends! Ten exclamation marks! Goodbye, reader, buy my next book ...And that is exactly the experience you'll get from \\"Ship of Fools\\". Moreover, it all ends in a jumble of badly forced drama, cheap-tragic heroism and the kind of stoic self-sacrifice you'd expect from a direct-to-video movie script. It's painfully illogical. There is not even the sense of an open end here, of questions better left open because we cannot possibly probe the alien mind. All questions are implicitly answered, only in a very, very stupid way. It's one big insult to the reader. \\"I'd say it's a piece of horse manure, but I've never seen a horse that big.\\"You'll hate this book if you're a more literary minded reader: it starts as good literature, then utterly collapses and ends up as cheap genre barf. And you'll hate this book if you're one of those no-frills SF fans: for them, everything up to planetfall will be a hell of a bore (all those discussions about religion, freedom of will etc.), while the ending is so forced, so hackneyed, threadbare and unengaging that they'll regret not having spent the money and time on another Star Wars novel instead ...Finally, back to the Dick award: the most charitable assumption on why Ship of Fools (also published as Unto Leviathan) was granted such an honour is that the jury members only read the first half of the novel, and dealt out the award in good faith, expecting that a novel that starts out that well couldn't possibly blow it all in the end. Any other assumption about the award-giving mechanism would be just too depressing. Philip K. Dick himself had the approach to start many of his stories with themes and motifs taken from lowly contemporary genre trash, but then giving unexpected depth to his material and twisting it into intriguing and deeply engaging works of literature, one could even say: philosophy. Russo, however, goes exactly the opposite way: he starts his novel as good literature (in the conceptual framework of a specific genre), does everything right for three quarters of the book, but then insults his reader with a cheap, stupid and utterly disappointing conclusion, with a broken promise ... He just totally blows it.Thus I conclude that in 2001 the jurors at the Norwescon found no one worthy of receiving the Philip K. Dick award. Instead, they decided to give away what was really an Anti-PKD-award to mark the worst and most pretentious failure of the year, and the winner was: Richard Paul Russo, \\"Ship of Fools\\". The rest was just one big misunderstanding ..."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I found myself with the same feeling as many reviewers after reading this novel. The conclusion leaves something to be desired but majority of the piece was quite satisfying. Much of the writing is understated:I have discovered since \\"Ship\\" that there is a penchant for bombast over style or quality in science fiction writing. Russo's approach to story telling allows you to savor moments subtle strangeness. The unfolding plot is given time so that over the course of the novel we are lead to believe that something of great importance is going to be revealed; The slow sometimes wondering plot threads of secondary characters suggest that the reader stay with author. We stick with the capable writing, we stay with the vivid imagery, and we hold on to the hope of a satisfying conclusion. In the end the book is satisfying but a disappointment. It does not conclude: it fades away. We are left with the notion that the author really didn't care for the characters, story, or process. I enjoy Russo's writing a great deal, the Carlluci trilogy is wonderful, but SHIP OF FOOLS leaves the reader without a real ending."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"PROs:- Zippy writing style- Nice, accelerating tension as the book progresses- I love the theme of first contact- Like the idea of a ship that has been traveling for centuries and that the crew doesn't know much about its origins and has become quasi-religiousCONS:- Bartolomeo, the protagonist, claims that many people don't like him. The book is told from the first person (I) perspective. However, Bartolomeo always treats everyone in a decent manner. Yes, he's deformed, but if he's a captain on a ship and treats everyone fairly, it's hard to believe that he is so disliked, even if he deformed. Either the author quit saying that Bartolomeo is disliked or he should have made him be more of a jerk.- So-so ending. I won't be a spoiler, but I would have liked a more satisfying ending.CONCLUSION: It's a good scifi book that I would recommend to many Sci-Fi nuts, but for those who are more picky, keep looking."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a book of ideas, says the Times review on the cover. And it is, in the way that finding what challenges you and confronts you as something that you need ideas to face the challenge and confrontation. But it does lack in results. There are many many mysteries, a thousand MacGuffins in the overall story, and a hatred for the church that seems to exude more from the author than the characters.Bartolomeo, the main character, is a rather refreshing personality in his lack of personality. Deformed, isolated, different, he's a connection to a reader who feels many of these things about themselves and wants to be a hero in a place that they are unwanted. His drive to discover defeats his humanity. In fact, in this story, he sometimes feels to truly be an alien amongst humanity, because his emotions are sharp but very detached from the person. Sadly this may be a fault of the author, as this book is a history, an autobiography told with a lot of textbook accuracy.The supporting cast runs the gambit of humanities stereotypes. And they give the book the flesh around the stiff exoskeleton of the main character. Always more human, more emotional, they drive him to do what he must for the ship, the crew, the situation.But I get too many missteps, too much ignorance, ambivalence and downright coldness from a lot of this book. Sometimes he moves too fast through moment, others too slowly. Overall the story has a great amount of potential, and there's a feeling I get at the end of this book that this wasn't just the ending, but a plan of maybe coming back to this story.Also, I'm not religious in any way, but I'm bored with religious characters as bad guys. This is a cliche that bugged me from the first chapter, so it's not a spoiler. Haven't we seen enough since Cardinal Richelieu?Also a good plug for the resellers here since this is an out of print book. They described it in much worse condition than I got it in. My copy was near pristine. Have faith in the resellers, they sent me a great copy.This book is a good read, a story about a morality that needs to be defined when floating through the malaise of reality, but with flaws that may turn you off. I found it good, and was compelled to the ending, but you may have a definite negative POV after its over."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"After reading some of the other reviews I'm wondering if I liked this book because I really don't know much about SF. That could be true. It could be true that this story has been written before, by somebody better. But I still thought Russo did a great job with the creepiness of the story.I read this book about 3 months ago, and I still get flashbacks to parts of the story. Russo isn't interested in answering questions and leaving the reader with a nice little package by the last page. He definitely leaves more questions unanswered than not.Overall, I thought this book was weird but very enjoyable. His protagonist is just so isolated from everyone except the reader that it makes for a very compelling experience. It was nice to read a scifi where the lead character isn't named John, 6 foot 5, and a stone cold bada**. Bartolomeo is both tough and fragile. He is so isolated emotionally from everyone on the ship yet he is certainly in the middle of all the important political and social action."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"At first I had a hard time, this book is rough and rather slow. But I realized its his style. He brings things to life and makes things realistic. His characters are unrefined so why should the dialog be refined? Also if the character was in the dark, so were the readers. A lot of complaints are how many unanswered questions there are, but question is, why do they need to be answered? The characters were unaware of the aliens motives just as we are unaware of the way others think. We can try to grasp it, but rarely do we truely understand it, and in a time where you are trying to save yourself you don't really stop to ponder why they would do it. Since they didn't ponder it we didn't get a response. They were in the dark, we were in the dark. Not every book has to end happily, the book wasn't open ended, the characters themselves didn't know what was in store for them, space is boundless, so we don't as well. I feel if everything was explained it'd be boring, this was just amazing, no useless explanations half of the chill this book gives is because you don't know. People take confort in knowing everything, and they don't like this book cause they can't know what and why, it just is.The characters were developed individual, their dialogue was unique to each one. The main character wasn't a standard, perfect, loveable character. There is a very good chance you won't even like him, I didn't.This book is well written, it draws you in and leaves you in the end with a chill down your spine.However, if you are someone who HAS TO KNOW why everything is the way it is, how everything ends, then don't read it. the unanswered questions aid the style and air of the story,I had my boyfriend read it after I did, I loved it so much I needed, neeeeded someone to talk to about it, and he absolutely loved it too.I can't see the word Antioch without thinking of it, it left a lasting impressionI've even purchased his other books."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Russo can definitely write very well and create characters you care about and invest in. This books starts off at like a rocket then sort of coasts to a soft thud. the political infighting is well done, but the middle of the book needed to be chopped WAY DOWN. And the end needed to be enhanced. He should have given you a few chapters on the planet or maybe sequel to developing the planet. That would be something to look forward to, how they fail and/or succeed in deevloping a new society. I will definitely read more form this author and hope the next book is more balanced."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I thought that the plot in \\"Ship of Fools\\" was fascinating and very interesting and the story moved along at a brisk pace with lots of twists and turns. The author's did a terrific job of creating the environment for this group of characters that are on this lonely ship and the adventure is riding on a high wave of suspense throughout the entire book. The characters are likable but flawed, and the science is better than most. Mr. Russo seems to have a deep understanding of the human spirit and clearly reflects it in the dialogues between the characters. I understand there may be a sequel to this book and I certainly look forward to reading the next installment. I would gladly recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Maybe closer to four and a half stars. This quick read was a breath of fresh air after the long-winded ramblings of the last book(s) I had read, Peter Hamilton's Commonwealth saga. Russo's prose is lean and spartan, and presented in very short chapters, an unusual style for most science fiction, and one that for the most part helps him to evoke and maintain an eerie disquiet throughout the book. I don't understand people's complaints about the ending of the book. No, we don't discover the origins or \\"reasons\\" for the alien ship and its actions, but those who wish Russo had done so, it seems to me, have missed the point. This story is a multiperspectival meditation on the nature of evil and otherness in a morally ambiguous universe, and to have been too literal or explanatory about such in the end would have been thoroughly contrary to Russo's subtle philosophical explorations throughout the rest of the novel. Fans of Iain M. Banks will probably like this one."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I started this at 9:30 A.M. finished it at 6:00 P.M.Could not put it down, blew-off my workout that I hope to do it tonight.The firstperson narative is great with Bartolommeo, being unique in himself.I like books that give me a little creepy feeling. I have not found many that do. I am not saying that it is scary. Few books are.There is intrigue, power-struggles and unique personal situations, on a huge spaceship that has been in space for centuries. This ship of so-called fools encounters a strange, advanceced and very alien vessel.This is No- Alien(A.D. Foster-from the screenplay-great book)though is slighly remenisce.I loved this book, though You may not, as some of the others here."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a thoroughly engaging read. The story and character development draw you in from the start and you are not disappointed up to the very end. I was uncertain if Russo could make the jump from short stories and serial work to a fully developed novel. He can, and did! I place Russo in my top ten of sci-fi/fantasy/future vision writers. His work is thought provoking, intriguing and, unlike many in the genre, he has a command of our language and a deeply intuitive feel for the pulse of our culture. I have read Ship of Fools twice, if for no other reason than I am wanting for more Russo and until his next book I at least have a very good piece of work to satisfy that need."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Ship of fools is very readable but I found it rather lacking in the plotting. The author wanted to set up a sense of dread and fear but did so at the cost of any depth. Characters tend to be paper thin and there is not enough background to explain any of their actions. Too much historical background is left unknown never allowing the reader to connect with the story."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Do not let the excellent wtiting and character development fool you. This is a book that truly underestimates its audience. During the whole book, there are questions, mysteries, and plot that are never resolved. Instead, we are left to think that not all questions are answered in life and to enjoy a sense of mystery.The problem is that what is left unresolved is not trivial, but quite major and essential. So, I truly think that the author developed the questions, plot twists, and other unknown facts WITHOUT EVER INTENDING RESOLVE THEM.Instead, he opted to satisfy his readers with a movie ending.So, I repeat: the author himself does not know what motivated the aliens, the reasons for the preponderance of the Church, the history of the humans, or anything that he teased us with.He never intended to answer these questions, so he did not bother to answer them in writing or even in his own mind."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Ship Of FoolsI will keep this review short and to the point.I have seen many B-film slasher movies, you know the type; brave girl decides it's a good idea to check on the strange noise coming from the dark room.

So much more could have been revealed, which would have added a great deal of interest, not to mention satisfaction, in the last chapter. Who were the aliens? Why did they impale humans mercilessly? Why the elaborate ruse of the vessel if the goal was simply to murder humankind?This book was frustrating, to say the least. I don't recommend it unless the reader is accustomed to multiple unresolved issues."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"The multi-generation starship Argonos has aimlessly wandered the galaxy for hundreds of years, searching for any signs of life. Its original mission and destination have long ago been forgotten. Returning to Earth is not an option, for it has become a toxic, irradiated wasteland.A mysterious signal draws the ship to an abandoned colony on an Earth-like planet. Nikko, the ship's captain, barely averts a mutiny as several hundred passengers would rather take their chances on the planet than stay on the ship any longer. The planet's attraction suddenly disappears when several hundred humanoid corpses are discovered in an underground room. The colony is abandoned because the inhabitants were slaughtered.Later, the Argonos comes upon what looks like a huge, derelict alien ship. Bartolomeo, Nikko's friend and advisor, advocates exploring the ship thoroughly. On the other hand, Bishop Saldana, Nikko's rival for the captaincy, is all for putting as much distance as possible between the ships. He is not the only one who feels malevolence, if not actual evil, from the alien ship.Room after room is explored on the alien ship, most of them being empty, with little or no sign of aliens. The decision is made to attach the two ships together, and tow the alien ship to an intelligent civilization (there has to be one somewhere) as a peace offering. Then, several hundred more humanoid corpses are discovered on the alien ship. Even Bartolomeo is convinced that the sooner they get away from the alien ship, the better. Now, the alien ship comes alive, refusing to let go of the Argonos.This is a really good, well-done story looking at the concept of evil. The author does a good job with the characters, and it will certainly keep the reader interested."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I thought this book was great. The characters were well developed, it had an interesting premise and plot. I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"The premise seemed good. The cover looked promising. However, this was one of the worst books I've read in years. I was shocked. It read like a direct-to-video movie. The characterization was unrealistic. Individual character traits, such as the deformities of the main character, were never explained nor added anything to the deapth of the character. There was absolutely NO explination for why the aliens would perform such savage acts on humans, why the humans let them do it, or how they went about performing said acts. There is likewise no explination of how the survivors plan on dealing with the consequences. The history of the ship is hinted at but never explored in any deapth. All in all, the book offers much promise, but delivers about as much as the average Schwarzenegger movie. I would not reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I've said to many people that I feel that Sci-Fi is like rock&roll; and bebop jazz and that most of the important work was done before 1973. While I acknowledge some good work done since then (Gene Wolf's novels come to mind), the genre has not produced the innumerable great writers that flourished in the golden age.I had high hopes for \\"Ship of Fools\\": the synopsis, the reviews, the PKD award and yes the packaging. Russo is an excellent technician as his prose is effortless to read and absorb. However, the novel was a confused mash of Sci-Fi cliches, flat characterization, unresolved mysteries, bad Star Trek scenes, high school philosophy, illogical plot devices and deus ex machina manipulations which destroyed my willing suspension of disbelief about half way through the book. In retrospect, the novel reminded me of a Dan Brown weekend, sans the Templar knights.I had been thinking of checking out the Carlucci novels but probably won't bother now. If this is the best book the PKD award people could find in 2001 then Sci-Fi is truly on life-support as a genre. Can China Mieville save the scene? He won't even call himself a Sci-Fi writer. I suppose Bruce Sterling was right in his comments on Slipstream fiction being the true heir to Sci-Fi's infinite tools of imagination. Sci-Fi is dead, long live Weird-Fi."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a thoroughly engaging read. The story and character development draw you in from the start and you are not disappointed up to the very end. I was uncertain if Russo could make the jump from short stories and serial work to a fully developed novel. He can, and did! I place Russo in my top ten of sci-fi/fantasy/future vision writers. His work is thought provoking, intriguing and, unlike many in the genre, he has a command of our language and a deeply intuitive feel for the pulse of our culture. I have read Ship of Fools twice, if for no other reason than I am wanting for more Russo and until his next book I at least have a very good piece of work to satisfy that need."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"i cannot understand why this novel was published, let alone won awards...as the other Negative reviews state, the setup was interesting. and then the author failed to do anything with it.i will go another step further than many of the Neg reviews, and say that the character development was also very weak -- how many times did you read a character had a \\"sly grin\\"? that is not development! was i the only one who learned that you dont *tell* your readers a character is \\"sly\\", you *show* them! russo didnt show us anything! he *says* the protagonist & the captain are close friends and have strong history, but he doesnt *show* us anything of the sort!and the oft-praised prose is trite and easily consumed. im a slow reader and i read this 370p jumbo-text book in three days during my free time (i work FT, have friends, etc). i suspect the font was made so large in order to fool buyers into thinking there was more *content* than there really was.as for the villians -- these super smart aliens build a marvel of science & technology, only to drift in space and....\\"KILL ALL HUMANS!!\\" so cliche. never explained. why? because the author himself has no idea why he wrote it this way...perhaps he didnt realize he was rehashing so many scifi cliches, perhaps he never thought to be critical of alien motivation.it goes on.. lame."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Pros:1) Russo is an excellent writer and very easy to read.2) He develops characters well3) He describes settings well4) He initiates a number of interesting conceptsCons:1) Ridiculously incomplete2) Virtually every important concept and event introduced was left underdeveloped and unexplainedBottom Line:If I had Russo's talent for writing, I'd be embarrassed to release such an incomplete work. Even if a sequel is on its way, this book left me feeling cheated. If he was a poor writer I could have dismissed the book shortly after picking it up, but because he has such obvious talent it was unexpected that he would fail to complete the many interesting concepts introduced."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Philip K. Dick Award winning author Russo spins an intriguing mystery in Ship of Fools. He delves deeply into what it means to be human. The crew of an intergenerational starship desperately seek a habitable planet. They are divided by class and religion. The ruins of a human colony lead them to an enormous alien vessel -- the first contact of humans with another intelligent species as far as they know. Will it save them or destroy them?"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a very thrilling book. Once you pick it up, you cannot put it down until you have finished it. The best thing about the whole book is that there isnt an effort to explain everything, which would have definitely made the book tedious. I think thats what sets Science Fiction genre apart. All the classics inspire some amount of awe in the mysteries they weave. There is also pathos in it and the triumph of the human spirit against all odds. I would recommend it with 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"A very dark story populated with fascinating, multi-dimensional characters.\\"Ship of Fools\\" is told from the perspective of the first officer of a giant generational star ship.

I delivers a great plot, very belivable and likable characters and much more. Above all else I loved the idea of a ship sailing aimlessly through space carying a population of several thousand people. Reading this book almost felt like reading a mystery novel. When the alien vessel is found and investigation of it is started it gets even more intense. I knew that something is going to happen and when it finally did I could not put the book down.This book reminded me of the movie Event Horizon more than anything else. Obviously, Event Horizon's main weakness was extreme amount of bloodshed. The idea of the movie was great nevertheless. The Ship of Fool does not make the same mistake and it keeps us wondering up until the end.I have to agree with other reviews written here... the book does leave some loose ends and some things are left unexplained. However, life is full of loose ends and their presence simply makes the book more realistic. Being bombarded with books movies and messages that have an answer to every plot twist, it is getting much harder to appreciate the complexities of the unexplained."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a thoroughly engaging read.

While not a fan of the sci fi genre, I found this to be a quick and entertaining read...actually pretty user friendly for the non &quot;space&quot; reader such as myself. It wasn't bogged down with a lot of technical alien/interplanetary mumbo jumbo. It actually had a story and some interesting character development. The pay off wasn't quite what I was hoping for, however, so it tended to come off in the end as a long episode of a sci fi show a la STAR TREK. Plenty amusing, tho, for that airplane ride or bedside table."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is the story of a spaceship that travels through space for no discernible reason. It has a ruling class and a huge cathedral, a powerful Bishop and a hereditary captain. The latter is advised by the narrator of the story, a man born deformed who wears visible prosthesis. At some point, the ship encounters an alien vessel, and the last part of the book is taken up with efforts to explore the vessel... I won't spoil it for you.The book builds up a bit of suspense but in the end the let down is palpable: this is a book where nothing is explained. Instead the author relies on vagueness to build up suspense; on intimations, partial indications, incomplete answers. This would be fine if there was some kind of payout at the end of the tunnel, but there ain't one folks. As for the ending, I think the past decades since the book was written have not worn well on it because it just made me want to shrug and say, yeah, so?"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Don't let the &quot;professional&quot; review above fool you. This book is about as good as non-hard science fiction gets.I've been following Russo since his first novel &quot;Destroying Angel&quot;, up to the last of the Carlucci books. Each one was more riveting than the first, with a definate emerging style of his own.In this novel, his style finally comes into fruition.Details details - every death has weight and is treated as a tragedy. Every character (except for a few PIVOTAL characters...minor problem there)has depth. The main characters view point consistant. The plot always moving.I don't want to give any more of the plot away than already has been said. If you like brooding, dark, obsessive tales that make you think and give hope to us SciFi lovers, this is your book.Read it."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I have read the good and not-so-good reviews of this novel that have preceded me, and I agree with them both.First, my complaints.The ending serves only as a point at which the pages stop, because it does not capitalize on ANYTHING that the novel set up prior to that point. This book should have been at least 550 pages to follow through on its potential appropriately. Without giving anything away, I shall make a quick list of things that are not properly elaborated on in the novel:- David- Father Veronica- The aliens- The alien ship- The \\"old woman\\"- Antioch- The novel's theological veins- Leona Frip and her catatonicality- Starlin and Winton, and- Every other point in the entire book!In fact, the Ship of Fools ends in a completely unexpected manner, simply because when reading it one figures there is no way in Heaven it could end so expectadly. ...The dialogue in Ship of Fools is very inconsistent, though it always retains a stripped-down feel that is appropriate at many points. At others, it reads like the work of an inexperienced writer who tries to be overdramatic and tends to be repetitive. Russo often leads into scenes of council or discussion that should go far deeper than they do, but are stopped short by poor dialogue. The beginning of the novel abounds especially with these instances, to the point where I was harboring serious thoughts of forgetting the book entirely.I had read the back cover, however, and was determined to at least reach the point at which \\"the grisly remains of a former colony\\" showed up.So I'm trudging steadily along, alternately grimacing or nodding hopefully as the novel hits high points and low. And then \\"the grisly remains\\" show up, and there is no way in hell that I'm not going to finish this book.I cannot recall whether the scene was particularly well written or not, mostly because I can recall no words at all. The enormity and suddenness and strangeness of it lent a tension to the rest of the novel which was, unfortunately, never aleviated. But for its promise, its subtle edginess, and the sheer power of that one scene (it's not often one image can hold a reader's interest throughout an entire book), I give it three stars.I just wish that Russo had explained that SCENE!!"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"These are the voyages of the starship Argonos, its 5-year mission to.....whoops, what is our mission? Where are going? Where did we come from? This is pretty much the setup for this Philip K. Dick award winning novel by Richard Russo. The Argonos is a starship that has been in space so long that all memory of its mission has been forgotten. Was it meant as an exploration vessel? A ship to make contact with alien life? Or was it a liferaft from a doomed Earth? Nobody knows. So they simply wander the universe with no purpose. I guess that would make them intergalactic existententialists?The ship is divided into distinct and competing social classes with the military, educated and the religious orders at the top while the workers grind away down below. In fact the captain of the ship is losing his grip over his command to the plotting of Bishop Saldano. The main character of the novel is Bartolomeo Aguilera, the boyhood friend and most trusted advisor of the captain. A signal from an unknown planet brings theArgonos to a deserted world. Well, it's not quite deserted, in a sealed section of a settlement they find thousands of human skeletons impaled on hooks. They show evidence of torture and horrible deaths. Soon after, another signal is received which will lure them to an alien spacecraft and even greater mystery.This novel had so much potential, but it was squandered. Russo never capitalizes on the suspense or horror of the first discovery. Most of the book concerns uneventful exploration, similar to Arthur C. Clarke's novel Rendezvous with Rama. It's not very engaging. If I wanted to read about exploration I would buy a memoir of a spelunker, not a science fiction novel. This aspect of the book was just plain boring. The human interaction between the characters was great, especially between Aguilera and the captain, and also a tragic love story between Aguilera and a woman priest.Another negative about the book was the lack of any resolution or explanation of questions which pile up in the book. It's like Russo leaves us hanging at the end just to prove how mysterious the universe really is. There's also a subliminal Christian message underlying the whole novel. Maybe the problem with this book was that it was underground religious fiction."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Richard Paul Russo is unquestionably one of our finest contemporary writers of science fiction. However, I wasn't satisfied with either the plot nor its end in his latest novel, &quot;Ship Of Fools&quot;. Russo offers some tantalizing clues regarding a deserted human colony on the planet Antioch and the mysterious alien starship which may be related to the colony's sudden demise, but he doesn't quite pull all the pieces together. As the tale's narrator, Bartolomeo Aguilera is an intriguing character, along with others as diverse as the Argonos's captain and Father Veronica. Yet I didn't understand why Bartolomeo would risk sending the colonists aboard the starship Argonos to the planet Antioch towards the end of the tale. Still, this is an enjoyable reading experience graced with some of Russo's best prose."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I'm always interested in sci fi novels that involve generations living and dying on a spaceship bound for who knows where. Often, however, after the author has expended a lot of energy detailing the society that has evolved onboard, he or she doesn't know where to go with the plot. &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; avoids this, and almost every other pitfall of the genre. Russo has thought up an interesting social structure, and has delved into its political and religious ramifications. He's come up with a crisis involving an alien civilization that is both sobering and scary. He's got a narrator who is interesting, with a real point of view. And he's managed to end his story without disppointing the reader. This book hooks you from the opening paragraph, and never lets up for a moment. It's probably the best sci fi I've read in a couple of years."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I enjoyed Ship of Fools immensely. Russo crafts a believable 'generation ship' and then dives into the machinations of different political and religious factions on board. The story is told from the perspective of an unusual protagonist, which serves to highlight the tension and claustrophobia, especially once they make planetfall. The encounter with the alien ship is very well handled and original. Overall this book is a great read. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"The editorial review of this book is rubbish. Obviously, the reviewer scanned through the book without ever becoming invested in the characters or their stories. This book requires us to think and really to associate ourselves within the story to fully understand the deeper allegory being told. There were a few places I found myself needing to reread earlier dialog to catch on to the deeper meaning of timeline events which made me feel my reading time was well spent. I've no need for books that spoon feed me the messages, I much prefer smart stories that tell their messages in subtlety as does Ship of Fools. Is there a tidy ending with all strings tied off? Are the characters flawless, perfect mental and physical specimens of the human race whom super humanly resolve every disaster via wit and good looks? No, the characters are flawed, both mentally and in some cases physically (a product of closed quarter circumstance), there are some unresolved questions that are, to be honest, best left unresolved in my opinion. Not every question in our life is answered in the time we have, so why should every question be answered in their lifetime? That there are still questions at the end is proof to me the realism of the story about a ship, traveling through the universe, generation after generation. Ship of Fools is just one aspect of a larger story spanning thousands of years. Such illustrates the fragility of life aboard the Argonos, and the unrequited hopes of her passengers.Good book, not great but good and as well written as any sci-fi has been written in quite some time. The pages (Kindl(e)y speaking of course) turn quickly and the dialog is rich. The science is accurate, the myth is engaging and the universe is enough like ours, imagined, that the story is easy to slip into. Likely better than the 4 stars I've given and not a 5, simply because I'm hoping for more to come and until it does, I'll not be satisfied."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Bartolomeo Aguilera has lived aboard the Argonos -- along with several thousand other people -- his entire life. After centuries in space, the ship's original mission has been lost to history. Now those aboard the Argonos wander somewhat aimlessly through the galaxy, seeking out worlds in which they may replenish their supplies and perhaps make some new discoveries.After many years without a successful landfall, the Argonos receives a transmission from a world they dub Antioch. While the transmission is likely automated, those aboard the Argonos decide to investigate. Upon reaching Antioch, several small settlements are located and teams are quickly organized to explore. Among those going to the planet is Bartolomeo. Upon landing, the settlements are clearly abandoned, but did the people leave of their own volition, was there an outbreak of some kind? Bartolomeo and the others proceed to investigate. What is found is so disturbing that the Argonos breaks orbit and decides to leave as quickly as possible.Several weeks after leaving Antioch, another discovery is made. A huge ship...clearly not of Human origin. For the first time in all the history of the Argonos (and possibly all Human history), contact is made with an extraterrestrial intelligence. Like on Antioch, Bartolomeo and others are sent to explore the ship. It quickly becomes apparent that Antioch and the alien ship are somehow connected. But how? For weeks, Bartolomeo is part of the ship's exploratory team. Slowly pieces begin to fit together...and then... Everyone's lives will change...Ship of Fools presents a fairly eerie trek through an encounter with an alien intelligence. The author pulls off well the dichotomy between the exploration of a benign alien ship and the inherent uneasiness Bartolomeo and others feel for the ship. The feeling the author tries to present is akin to walking down a dark alley late at night. There may be no one there...but you are constantly looking over your shoulder wondering about the shadows. While the ending of the story was appropriate, I do wish that (without giving away too much) it had been more...conclusive. Nonetheless, Ship of Fools is an enjoyable -- if a touch creepy -- alien contact tale."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a dark, creepy space opera. The setup is a ship that has been traveling around randomly for generations -- possibly thousands of years. Then they find a human colony, but everyone is dead.This was a page turner. Highly recommended. Think Rendezvous with Rama, if Neil Gaiman had written it."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I agree with the other reviewers here who wonder what is behind the conspicuous number of apparently loose ends in the book, and I still can't help but wonder if I've completely missed some underlying connection. One might attribute these things to the essential inscrutability of that which is alien but, as others have mentioned, there is a real danger of leaving the reader dissatisfied. What's more, it was not clear that some of the loose ends were even related to the aliens- I still don't really understand the motives of the bishop, who we are told has a strong interest in creating machines but is only seen utilizing one as part of a baroque assassination attempt.In spite of these things, I was utterly gripped by the middle-to-end of the book, frequently taken by surprise by the developments in the story and anticipating some shocking conclusion. For instance, was it going to be revealed that there some temporal anomaly and the skeletons on Antioch were actually the hapless crew of the Argonos? Why the reference by the bishop to Schrodinger's cat? Were the horrors in the alien ship somehow a product of the fears and expectations of the explorers? Surely something had to tie together."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I think what a lot of the reviewers are missing is the fact that Richard Paul Russo can WRITE! I was drawn from chapter to chapter in a way I haven't been in years--the book had the feel similar to that in Rendevous with Rama. I don't read much science fiction anymore--there is so little sense of wonder in it. Ship of Fools has wonder aplenty, and the characterization is excellent. Nor did I find the dialogue clumsy, as one reviewer did. I was most impressed with Russo's balanced viewpoint between Christianity and disbelief. A sympathetic priest in a SF novel? Quite refreshing.The scene with Father Veronica (you know the one I mean) is breathtaking. And yes, I felt the ending was not quite as dramatic as I would have liked. But I really enjoyed the ride. I would indeed read the sequel, but I rather hope there isn't one.I also hope that those who read these reviews and decide to buy the book buy a new version rather than a used one. The writer receives no royalties on used books, and cannot continue to be published unless someone buys new copies."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I was fooled by the &quot;ship of fools&quot;. I must say this is one of the weirdest books i've read, not because it has strange ideas - it hasn't - and not because of the plot - it doesn't exist - but because I've finished reading it and I asked myself what? What did Mr. Russo want to say? and if indeed want he did - where did it go wrong? The book is very readable, you can read it cover to cover in a couple of hours, but in the end, I'm sure you would wonder yourself: why? Reading it through I feel like opening layer after layer of gift-wrappings, only to discover there's no present inside. Very very disappointing."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"A tiny speck of matter among the billions of stars that make up our galaxy, the Argonos spacecraft is meandering through the vast emptiness of space, from one star system to another, replenishing supplies from suitable planets and then moving on. The ship, home to thousands of people, has been wandering in isolation for centuries, but its origins and purpose have been lost. How does this situation affect the religious views of those on board? What will they encounter in the uncharted depths of space?Russo's exquisite writing has integrity and is backed up by a keen understanding of human behavior. The characters are genuine and the dialog has depth. I was already a fan of the main character and narrator, Bartolomeo, after the first 10 pages. Instead of insulting the reader with needless explanation and gratuitous filler, he lets this mysterious and compelling story unfold, and kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning. I just bought his collected Carlucci novels, and I can't wait to sink my teeth into it."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"The story is told through the eyes of Bartolomeo, a prickly fellow born deformed and raised by adults who he assumes knew his parents. He lives on a starship that has been wandering throughout the galaxy for centuries. All those on board had been born there. The purpose of their voyage remains elusive, and the archives that would give the passengers a sense of their past have been destroyed. It has been 14 years since the ship, called the Argonos, has visited a human habitation.As the story begins a signal is detected from a nearby planet. Bartolomeo leads a team to explore an area of the planet that looks to have once held a human colony. Now, though, it appears deserted. In a deep cavern beneath an odd star shaped building the team discovers the remains of the colonists and are sickened by the hideous manner of their deaths. Hours later the Argonos intercepts another signal, this one coming from deep space. The source is a barren, alien spaceship at once fascinating and frightening.I read this book about 3 years ago and the story stayed with me. I recently read it again, and the last hundred pages held me enthralled even though I knew what was going to happen. The characters and plot are very well developed. Yes, there are unresolved issues as some critics have pointed out. The aliens remain an elusive mystery, but that is part of what makes this novel ring true. Like real life some questions are never answered."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"If Ship of Fools had more of a conclusion, it would have been at the top of my list. However, Russo seems to have grown tired toward the end, and the pure energy that fills the first 805 of the book is lost.Still, Ship of Fools is full of excitement and discovery. Despite being set in a cliche (the &quot;colony of people who live on a ship and have never set foot on a planet&quot; cliche), Russo manages to pull of a highly original series of events. All of them surround the discovery of a mysterious vessel, which keeps a singular focus within the story. However, the events themselves range from death to inner conflict to paranoia to sympathy. Ultimately, it is a tale of exploration that is approached from many levels, grounded in the most obvious exploration -- that of the ship.If only it had an end, it would be a 5-star book. When I finished reading it, I immediately went online to order the sequel... I just assumed there was one, and was devastated when I learned otherwise.I would still recommend this highly to those looking for an interesting story about discovery and exploration, and anyone who enjoys reading because it makes you think. For those who look to sci-fi for space battles and combat and three-breasted she-beasts... well, while there is a cloud of danger and some action, this probably is not what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a well-written thematic story. Although it has several subplots, the main storyline is written to demonstrate the power of human curiosity. Russo takes his characters through a journey of exploration punctuated by frequent and gruesome clues that Something Is Not Right. But the characters press on, and - here is the magic of Russo's storytelling - the reader is right there with them. The lure of the unknown is so strong that you are willing to leap through every new doorway just to see what is on the other side, no matter how many dried corpses or mysterious accidents should have cautioned you away. Even after the last page is turned and the folly of the exploration unmasked, the book leaves you with the nagging urge to go back, to open one more door or seek the answer to one more question - a powerful demonstration of what Pavlovian creatures we can be."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I didn't find the ending shocking or horrible, mostly because I scanned the reviews here before coming across the book at Borders, so I was steeled for whatever might come. As endings go, I've read worse but it did feel tacked on. It's true that, in real life, one's way of life can abruptly end but, in this case, it seemed a bit hard to believe.Russo is a good writer and I applaud him for taking on a novel with ambitious ideas. Prior to \\"Ship of Fools\\", I'd only read one short story by him but it was one of the most moving things I've ever read. So, I had a clue going into this book that Russo wouldn't deal with any ideas, concepts or plots that were small potatoes.Having said that, I don't think the execution measured up to his ambitions. To a certain extent, I think that's okay; at least he tried to grapple with some big ideas. I don't feel my time reading the book was wasted but I probably wouldn't suggest it to my SF-reading friends either.In life, things don't get resolved right away. Sometimes they don't get resolved at all. Granted. But this isn't real life, this is fiction and even fiction that's aiming for a realistic tone (in other words, not everything wraps up neatly at the end like a fairy tale) has to follow certain rules. I was fine with some things not getting answered, but Russo left too many things hanging, for me. Plus, after a while, the explanation, \\"Well, they're aliens!\\" starts to sound like just an excuse. Being complex is not the same thing as being random. The aliens have to have their own internal logic and the author has to know what that is, regardless of what is actually revealed to the reader. Sadly, I don't know if he did know all the reasons they did the things they did or let certain things happen.My main quibbles with the book actually have less to do with the plot and more to do with the characters. Bartolomeo was hard to connect with as a main character. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, our experience is all with him. If he doesn't know something, we don't know. He's our touchstone and guide through the story. The trouble is, I found it really hard to stomach him. He says many times in the book that not many people on the ship like him and, you know what? I can see why. He's bright and that makes him interesting but he's not a bit likable. He has little sympathy for anyone and that makes it hard to have sympathy with him. He himself, in his described appearance and personality, is somewhat alien.Father Veronica was a more personable character but her expressed theology bugged me. She's not a Christian, she's a Deist, which is a whole other kettle of theological fish. To a certain extent, it makes sense: Deism believes in a closed universe and all she's ever known is another closed world, the ship. I just wish her views had been properly identified as such because, as a theologian myself, I'd hate anyone to think the character's belief was Christianity.Plus, a woman as bright as she seemed to be should know, from reading the Bible, if nothing else, that there are many functions of prayer, not just one, and that the concept of human free will does not automatically exclude the possiblity of divine intervention into the natural world.I admit this sticks in my craw for personal and professional reasons but I just wish authors would present a faith accurately or leave it alone. Or, if they are going to be distortions (which could easily happen on a generational ship that has no outside stimuli from the greater galaxy) then I would prefer that be explained. But Russo made it seem as if Father Veronica were preaching the real gospel -- and one wants to be on her side because the other religious figure of the book is so horrible -- but the truth is neither one of them has an orthodox view.All in all, it wasn't a bad read but it could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is one scary book. The world Russo builds is so realistic, and the aliens so mysterious, that you can't help but be drawn into the suspense, fear, and confusion the characters feel as they try to understand the strange and gruesome artifacts they discover, and as they disagree on how to interpret and react to events. Top notch fiction, but if you are prone to nightmares you'll want to read this during the daytime. Russo's Carlucci novels are also very good (though very different as well)."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Is it just me, or are lost generation ship novels making a comeback?Hearkening back to classic SF works like _Non-Stop_ to _Orphans of the Sky_, and more recently Elizabeth Bear's _Jacob's Ladder_ series (_Dust_, _Chill_, and _Grail_), fascinating stories have been told about generations upon generations of people living aboard massive ships where the journey's original purpose is lost to time.The crew aboard the Argonos are not quite so clueless as the inhabitants of the previously mentioned books, but they have nontheless lost their way; like the crew in the traditional woodcut, they seem a motley bunch with neither purpose nor direction, a malaise of pointless, repetitive existence. When the ship encounters an inhabitable planet, the oppressed workers make an attempt to colonize the world, but Russo moves beyond class consciousness when a signal from the planet leads to a potential first contact situation.As events turn from bad to worse, however, the ship's leading crew members come to turn aside from their individual listless and petty agendas and discover a purpose--to save the people from the Argonos from a horrific end."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Wow! This, for me, was one of those rare books that you enjoy every moment. The story is told by Bartolomeo, the captain's assistant on a ship exploring space for genertations. There are thousands on board, who live according to a class system, with the Church near the top. The book is divided into three parts. The first tells the story of an attempted mutiny by the lower class, after the discovery of an apparent habitable planet. The second involves the exploration of an alien vessel drifting in space. The final part reveals the doomed nature of the mission. One review of this book called it \\"Alien with intellect\\", and that is pretty accurate. While elements of \\"Alien\\" are present, this book is so much more. The characters are intelligent and interesting. Scenes are superbly described, with many images effective enough to likely stay in your memory for a long time. The politics and difficulties of a self contained world on a ship are well described. Religion is a sub-theme for the story, and the role it plays is fascinating. Other themes are identity, isolation, friendship, and good and evil. Everything comes together flawlessly, and the pace is designed to get maximum results. This is a psychological drama/suspense story, and as such it is excellent."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Finally I picked a book which wasn't just a three star average story. I am so glad that I found that book. It is one hell of a page turner and absorbing from the first to the last page. The style reminded me of Alastair Reynolds but just not as complex and mind twisting. Richard Russo has a great talent for creating an \\"Alien meets Event Horizon\\" kind of environment. When you read that book you want to make sure you are not alone! People who enjoy dark, gothic, and fear laden movies such as Alien will get a kick out of this book. On the negative side it would not be surprising if some people do not like the ending. I am not going into any details but you should not expect a happy Hollywood brainwashed finale. I personally do hope Russo keeps the story going in another book. In summary, it is a great book with a great story and great characters all along, it deserves 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I picked up this book not knowing anything about the author. Ship of Fools held my interest a lot more than I expected.At first, I thought this was a suspense book set in outer space, with a lot of the questions from Rama and logistics from 2010. After mulling it over, I think this book works best as a study of the political trappings of the Aragnos. The alien spaceship and Antioch serve as the catalyst for changing the dynamics of the Aragnos civilization.Sure, everyone would like all the alien issues resolved, but I think this book is worth the read even without all the i's crossed and t's dotted."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"\\"Ship of Fools\\" is set on the Argonos, a starship housing a small society which has been shipbound for hundreds of years. The story opens on the cusp of a proletarian rebellion and a potential theocratic coup d'etat, and the narrator, one of the captain's closest advisors, finds himself caught up in political affairs. At the same time, the society's ancient history and mission is called on: a dead human planet, and then a dead alien ship, are discovered, and the inhabitants of the Argonos must piece together the mysteries they offer.The issues explored by \\"Ship of Fools\\" are many and varied: religious belief and its place in politics, class struggles, the nature and strength of friendship, the existence and religious framework of evil (and whether it can conquer the truly unwilling), and the ultimate power and legitimacy of self-sacrifice. Yet somehow, even while considering all this, the plot is gripping and fast-paced, the narration is enjoyable, and the book is impossible to put down.The major drawback of \\"Ship of Fools\\" is that it tries to do more than is ultimately possible. Many of the issues the novel raises - physical disability and deformity, unrequited romantic love - are ignored entirely. Most of the issues that are discussed are not resolved; in fact, even the action of the story is only partially settled.Lack of closure is not always a fatal error, however, especially in a book with so many satisfying narrative and thematic elements. Perhaps the author intends to complete the story in a sequel; if so, it will surely be worthwhile reading. Even if \\"Ship of Fools\\" is the complete story of the Argonos and its inhabitants, it is compelling and thought-provoking reading worthy of any science-fiction fan."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Be forewarned, as many of the other reviews have stated, much of the story, particularily the ending, is not clear cut. If you are the type who needs to know exactly what happened, to know every detail of how the main characters fare, this might not be the novel for you.I found the concept, and the story to be fascinating. Russo paints a broad portrait of what is occuring by focusing on one major character, Bartolomeo. It is not giving away to much to say that the book is a narrative from that character. The author does not step away this character, and fill in other events that are unknown to him. If Bartholomew is not aware of an event, or aware of a reason for something, then the reader isnt either. This is why not every detail of what is occuring is known to us, simply because Bartolomeo isnt aware of them. The aliens are a mystery throughout the book, why is this? It's because Bartolomeo doesnt know. Why do certain events occur? If he doesnt know then we dont know.If you are the type of reader who likes a good mystery, who can fill in spots using your imagination, who doesnt need everything spelled out for you, who doesnt always need everything to conform to whats normally done, then i highly recommend the book. If you like spelled out endings where everything is clear, dont bother, you wont like it."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"While this book might not appeal to some readers, to me it was wonderful. It was creepy, intelligent, and very hard to put down. It has echoes of Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Rama\\" series, Alastair Reynolds' \\"Chasm City\\", and Peter F. Hamilton's \\"Reality Dysfunction\\" series. The characters are likable but flawed, and the science is better than most. I am anxious to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"One of the few sf novels to explore the hard questions of religion and faith. The character of Father Veronica is the best thing about the book. Her character is the lynch pin that holds the story together; deeply nuanced, tender, honest, unfailingly faithful, yet frought with personal doubts. The prose is spare, but extremely descriptive; I feel like I've been on the Argonos, a generation starship to end them all. The only quibble; too many ideas and scenes that are left unexplained. The ending is a perfect set-up for a sequel, but there is no indication in the blurbs that this is the first in a series, although I would welcome a follow-up. I want to know the answers to all the questions! Definitely a good read; the kind you can't put down."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"If you've ever wondered what human beings are capable of when given unlimited power and/or resources, you can look at Elvis Presley or Bill Gates. If you've ever wondered what human beings would do when they start asking, &quot;Where are we going?&quot; &quot;What do we want?&quot; &quot;What is our purpose?&quot; you could read SHIP OF FOOLS.The book deals with The Big Questions in a way that is both dramatic, suspenseful, and accessible. As with most human action when confronted with the unknown, we are by turns contemptible and small--and on rare occasions, noble. And that's what the book is about.Some reviewers gripe that not all the knots are fully unravelled. So what was the great white face of Moby Dick? Nothingness? The futility of human action? People still wonder about that one. So a few residual knots are not a problem for me.The only quibble I have with the book is the title. Although it's appropriate, in the spirit of its allegorical nature, I would have titled it YOU ARE HERE."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"This is a thoroughly engaging read. The story and character development draw you in from the start and you are not disappointed up to the very end.

You could call it plagiarism if it didn't plainly reek of creative bankruptcy. The theological investigations alluring to so many previous reviewers are pedantic, obvious, and naive. I'd label this a Christian attempt at scifi if I didn't hesitate to lambaste other far more insightful works with Russo's hackjob.

BORING! the only good thing about this was the endearing Father Veronica."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Russo's Carlucci novels aren't &quot;hard sci-fi,&quot; so I wasn't sure what to expect from this, a 'deep-space saga.' What it turned out to be, primarily, is Russo working against all expectations of the genre.He breaks several defacto rules, and presents some very unusual twists. Without giving away too much of the story:* The narrator is imprisoned for 7 months, and misses everything that happens during his absence* The main love interest is left unconsummated, and ends in a death* Several major plot directions just evaporate, halfway developed (just like real life...)* The ending leaves more questions unanswered than notRusso's short stories in &quot;Terminal Visions&quot; were highly developed and fully consistent, which makes all the more inexplicable the errors of scale here, a sort of &quot;Star Trek&quot; myopia:* The Argonos has visited a number of star systems within the lifetime of the narrator, which completely ignores the distances involved* Although set is a far-distant future of interstellar travel, telephones, video screens and ship controls are present-day* The population of the ship is &quot;several thousand&quot; which isn't enough for a true breeding colony* The ship is listed as self-sufficient, but the infrastructure for self-sufficiency isn't evident* For a ship/colony large enough to be self-sufficient, there are only a handful of characters who figure in the plotBut these concerns didn't really detract from the novel. Russo's strength, throughout all of his books, is his characterizations and &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; is no exception. He creates 3-dimensional people you can believe in, and runs them through a storyline that is unpredictable, generates some genuine feelings of dread and uncertainty, and does it with page-turning intensity.Despite breaking all the conventions of the genre -- or perhaps because of it -- this novel is a worthy addition to the pantheon."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"... I don't know. This book contained a lot of stupid rambling The plot could have been great but there were no explanations for a lot of things happening... blame it on aliens and just say since they are aliens, we are not going to understand the motives..."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. The main theme seems to be that plots/characters/\\"villians\\"/etc. aren't wrapped in a neat little cliched box - and that's what makes this story so unique.The plot basically revolves around Bartolomeo, the ad hoc first officer of the \\"generation ship\\" Argonos. But Bartolomeo is not your average hero (or even anti-hero) - he was born crippled, without parents, is not well-liked by any of the many factions onboard ship. He's not the perfect, unblemished character but you quickly grow to like him. Why? Because he seems to be the only one who is smart, unbiased, and principled of anyone in power.The Argonos itself is a huge ship which houses thousands of people. Its original mission is unclear and after 500+ years in space, it quickly becomes apparent that there really isn't any true purpose for it. It is as aimless as its divided, unique passengers and crew. In their wandering, the Argonos detects a signal and comes across a colonized planet where everyone has been massacred. What really happened is a mystery.Before leaving, Bartolomeo helps the serf-like lower caste of the ship's population lead an aborted mutiny. He falls from favor and is imprisoned. The Argonos leaves to follow the signal to its source and they discover a dead ship of alien origin. What is its purpose? How is it tied to the planet and its dead population? Is it good, evil, neutral? To answer this, Bartolomeo is released and given a second chance - lead the exploration of the alien ship and try to figure out its purpose.From here on, EVERYTHING changes and the Argonos and its people will never be the same. Sure, not everything is revealed and handed to you on a platter - the author challenges the reader to use their imagination. And that's what makes this book work. It's the reason it won the Philip K Dick award - it challenges your perspective, your prejudices, and your imagination."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Stylish and provocative, suspensefull and mysterious. This is definitely the kind of sci-fi novel that will not let you set it down until you finish it. There is very little monotony, it kept me turning every page with more and more anticipation and relentless curiosity. I absolutely loved the idea of a gigantic ship that has been the home of humans for so many hundreds of years that some even believe the ship has always existed.The ending is very un-hollywood which is a good thing, a little inconclusive and leaves the reader hoping for a sequel. Nevertheless, this book won't let you set it down! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Like other readers I was both awed and disappointed by this masterful story. The saga expands in an almost poetical vein with pointed characterization and succinct plots within plots. The ideas discussed in this book - origins, family, meaning of life, aliens, religion, discovery - require a sequeal and perhaps a prequel.High praise for the sparse, direct, superb writing and crafting.Kudos for interesting characters and for a new presentation of several well-used themes. Man's first encounter with ETs has been told again and again, yet this indirect approach is one of the best. The horrific race remains thoroughly &quot;alien&quot; to the end - their thoughts, morals, purposes and society a mystery, undecipherable. More positives: The elusive, alluring female priest, the shadowy bishop, the manner in which the dark, cloistered mood is created.Points needing expanding or revising: The origin of the &quot;Ship&quot;,The prominence of the Church - for logical not philosophical reasons. If anything, the role of the Church in the far future will be less that it is not now. The inscrutability of the aliens - why did they commit these horrific acts, to what purpose? Why did they remain hidden? Finally, what happens to the group on Antioch.Still, if you are not looking for &quot;this is Agon from the planet Zedur; stop your atomic testing or face destruction&quot; fiction but instead want a heady, taut experience, this is the one for you."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Fantastic! No wonder this book has reached the top-ten lists of some of the science fiction forums.The setting of a group of people on this lonely ship is well laid out. The characters are impressive in their humanity and the adventure is riding on a high wave of suspense throughout the entire book. Russo has a deep understanding of the human spirit and clearly reflects it in the dialogues between the characters.The plot is very interesting and full with twists. The pace of the events is fast and the suspense high. What else could you ask for?Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Fist of all: I won't give away the story !I thoroughly enjoyed the creation and development of the different characters. After only 2 pages I felt tied tothe story. Since I read some of the other reviews before Istarted reading the book I knew that the ending might not be forthcoming with ALL the answers and so I could trim my expectations optimally. That made a difference!The book made me interested in looking for more Science Fictionwhich is another compliment I want to make to the author.I liked that the main character was not the top notch strong, good looking and super-smart guy but was born with quite a fewdefects. Unlike some others I enjoyed the partitioning of thebook. It enhanced the feeling of progress in reading and fitted the narrative baseline of the story. It was like having a lotof snacks.I ovserved that at few moments the author had a little trouble to maintain the quality of a couple characters, they kinda lostmomentum or faded a little. This could be explained with furtherplans for another volume. There was only one part I felt was rather unskillful (2 pages or so) with a discussion between two characters about god and his role. It read like frozen tomato soup, - if I may say so. Yet compared to 370 pages of very goodstuff those couple pages are easily absorbed into a 5-star rating. Like someone else said: the last quarter of the bookwas so intense that it was impossible to stop. I absolutely hadto finish the book.Five stars, well deserved !"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"The book won the Phillip K. Dick Award and it deserved it. The basic plot here is whether or not there is evil in the universe. There is, although just what is the nature of this evil remains a bit of a mystery. The book keep me interested from beginning to end and made me think a lot along the way. Russo makes no attempt to explain the exact situation, but simply takes you along for the ride. This is the first time I've read this author, but I'm looking forward to getting some of his other books. Excellent! I guess the only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ending sort of left me a bit cold; I would have preferred a more definitive end."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"&quot;Ship of Fools&quot; seems to be that polarizing kind of book that folks either love and hate. The prose is well-written, Russo keeps the plot moving and the pages turning, and the novel is an engrossing read...until the end.The end, as others have mentioned, is where it all goes horribly wrong.Up to that point, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; is a somewhat standard but entertaining mix of Clarke's &quot;Rendezvous With Rama&quot; and Heinlein's &quot;Universe.&quot; Russo adds some interesting political and social observations on the theme of a ship that's been in space so long it's all anyone remembers. Putting class struggles on a ship was particularly inspired. It's when the ship starts exploring a seemingly dead ship (the &quot;Rama&quot; plotline) that Russo paints himself into a corner he can't get out of.The ship is Big and Mysterious--and maybe even Evil. But once Russo has given this ship all kinds of mysteries, the book ends with a movie-like escape sequence. It's ultimately unsatisfying, like reading through 300 pages of suspense only for the conclusion, &quot;...and then the little boy woke up.&quot;Some have argued that this is an expression of the theme that space is big and mysterious, and that there are no answers. That point is well taken, but even a novel on this theme must throw some sort of bone to the reader--a sign that the author really is trying to make that point. Otherwise, an ending like this makes it hard to tell whether the author had some grand point in mind, or merely stopped when he hit his word count.&quot;Ship of Fools&quot; had me engrossed while I read it, but after I'd finished, it was like having read half a book."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Reading through the reviews, I can't say I'm surprised that there are many people who don't understand the book. This is not a book about spaceships, aliens, or colonization. These are metaphors and the book is a huge allegory. If words like metaphor and allegory are odd to you, chances are you won't understand the book. On the other hand, if you're one of those science fiction fans who understands that Bladerunner isn't a film about a bounty hunter and androids, but about the search for meaning in life, then this book will probably appeal to you greatly.There's not really much to say about the book other than that. It is what it is. And that's one of the finest philosophical novels I've read in years."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"While there is a not fully resolved feeling to the ending, this is nevertheless a truly splendid SF read, and one that tackles some spiritual issues (faith, prayer, evil) without being a knee-jerk anti-religious tract. Refreshing. The main character is fascinating--an outsider even among outsiders, but one who connects in friendship with those at every level of this spaceship society (religious, political, underworlders). Bartolomeo is a man deformed by genetics, repaired by prosthetics, and at core sensitive and moral. He struggles to play the political game presented to him, lives with a certain weight of loneliness, but he takes risks to do what he thinks is right. It costs him. But it always costs when you have to make the tough decisions, which our hero must in fighting against an unjust political system and then against a sadistic and enigmatic alien presence.The alien menace (faceless and formless) is a great metaphor for evil. It's there, but you don't really understand it. You just try to fight it the best you can and survive.I loved the growing relationship between Bartolomeo (our atheist hero) and Father Veronica (a true believer). It rounds out his character that he is someone who has the ability to be both tender and tough, calculating and vulnerable, skeptical but wondering if belief might not offer comforts.The fact that the story is not completely resolved as far as the fate of the people of the Argonos annoyed me a little at first, then made sense. The questions that arise when one ponders the nature of evil and of the meaning of life are open-ended, they continue. We haven't vanquished evil. Many people are mired in meaninglessness. We live open-endedly---not really knowing how the tale plays out at the end. So, the ending made sense. There may be Eden or Hell as a destination. But the struggle to live, to find a place to call our own continues...Then again, maybe a sequel is in the works to explain what is left unwritten. :) I'd read it!But if I had my druthers, I think I'd like leaving it with a bit of mystery.Thanks, Mr. Russo, for a wonderful few hours entertainment and pondering....*Mir*"},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"After tearing through this book and staying up late last night to finish it, I have to disagree strongly with the professional review here. This book was a knock out. It was very easy to imagine these events occurring in our future. The writing is definitely a fat notch above the usual sci fi fare. Good writing, a great story, depth of characterization, and a lot to ponder...a five star book, in my book. Unresolved issues? Did the professional reviewer expect an answer to why God allows pain? The theology here is not cut and dried. Great science fiction takes a fundamental question and builds an interesting story around it. And leaves the questions unanswered. I wouldn't change a thing about this story, except maybe the Bishop. He was a bit too shallow, undefined. Maybe there was a reason for that, though.Hmm.

I like it for the fact that it reminds me of a X file episode. Where it always leaves you hanging wanting more. . It was a lot like reading a fast manuscript for a movie idea. So many things seemed like they could have been more fully explained or given more depth. Doesn't mean it wasn't a fun read however. &lt;don't read past it will ruin the book>. On the other hand there were a number of things wrong with the story if it was minimally examined. The old women was a sore point for me. Pg 199 with him speaking Spanish, so lame. Then the question of the old women/alien speaking of the planet name given by the bishop. Why would aliens with superior intellect and technology make such a careless statement. Why are the aliens dumb enough to leave doors unlocked that have tons of rotting dead people yet smart enough to control gravity etc. Why are the alien blaster weapons so weak and fire only at the last two ships. Why do some of the people go crazy. Why did the bishop try to kill him, and in such a strange way. What did the machine the bishop had at the start have too do with anything. What became of reading the records the church had. Why is jumping in a worm hole at the end going to save anyone, don't the aliens know the coordinates back to the planet. And a bunch more.In the end I give it a 3 out of 5. Fun read but not enough."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"I am a big fan of Russo's past works, and so I know he is a talented writer. Using that as a starting point helps understanding this novel as I know the type of narrative, story development, and situations have been created very carefully by the author for a reason. The story is told from the first person point of view, and therefore can only represent what that person feels and believes. He is not all-knowing, and therefore does not always have a good explanation of why some of the inexplicable things happen.Some people have complained about loose threads not being tied up and the ending being rather sudden...well, that is what life is really like and the novel simply follows one persons intrepretation of events. Encounters with aliens aren't always going to make sense because they are ALIEN! There is no common frame of reference, and the story is ongoing just like the long history of the Argonos itself.I enjoyed the suspense, mystery, and religious explorations that this novel presented and really enjoyed spending time with these characters and ideas. I recommend this book, and really any other from Richard Paul Russo."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"\\"Ship of Fools\\" does what many science fiction books fail to do (and this is true of movies, too): It puts believable and interesting characters in settings that are exciting or wondrous. Too much science fiction is written by people who spend all their time in the lab or on the computer or in their basements playing Dungeons and Dragons. Characters with any real depth are usually lacking from writers of this sort. Russo knows how to write real people and he also understands when not to explain or show something. In terms of \\"cool\\" gadgets and technology there's nothing new here. This is a novel about relationships and about moral dilemmas. I gave it four stars only because I think people who write these reviews hand out 5 stars much too easily. This is a good book, an enjoyable read, and worth your time."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Reading Russo's &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; is one of the most regrettable reading experiences I've had in years. This book reads like a novelization of some deservedly straight-to-video &quot;Aliens&quot; knock-off. The author tries to spook us, and subscribes heavily to the &quot;what you don't see is scarier than what you do&quot; school of the macabre.Unfortunately, Russo winds up showing the readers nothing of interest or originality, leaving us stranded aboard the dingy corridors of his fanciful generation ark hoping against hope that something interesting will happen.Be afraid.

I'm an avid reader, and have enjoyed &quot;realistic&quot; novels that explore character, and even occasionally leave plot threads hanging.Russo in this novel doesn't leave just a few threads hanging. Nearly every chapter introduces characters and incidents with great fanfare and foreshadowing, and then . . . never mentions them again. The novel reads much as genuine journal would read, written by someone who doesn't know much, if anything, about what was really happening. But why would I want to read such a thing, especially since it's NOT a genuine journal? I didn't find the character development, dialoge, theological explorations, or anything else about this book strong enough to overshadow the fact that it's a disappointing, plotless novel that reads remarkably as if the author wrote two or three similar books, attached chapters together randomly, and then lost the last half of the novel altogether.Frankly, I'm surprised this one got past the publisher, and I'm still annoyed that a few hours of my time was wasted reading the darn thing."},{"Title":"Ship of Fools","review":"Begins with interesting characters and compelling intrigue.

The only thing I did not like about this story was the ending. The little prince, with a help of a snake goes back to his planet after a year on Earth. It is a little dark, but perhaps that is just the adult in me seeing with my eyes and not my heart. I give this story 5 out of 5.

This is a terrible publishing hackjob. Petra Books seems to be an extremely shady operation (its website is flagged as malware in my Chrome browser). The formatting is ugly and generic and the binding seems shoddy, but the real issue is the famous images. It appears that someone took photos of a Le Petit Prince with their phone, converted them to extremely lossy jpegs, photocopied them, repeated this process several times. This is not a professionally book. This was meant to be a gift for a friend but I am returning it because it is just unacceptably horrible. DO NOT BUY.

The pilot tries and finally draws the sheep...a box, the sheep is inside, he tells the prince. This book is so full of symbolism. Saint-Exupery wrote this book in a way that ideas could be conveyed to children while also educating the adults. He talks about the greedy man, the workaholic, the &quot;king&quot;, and many other kinds of people. He also talks about that important person in our lives, the ROSE, who is like the rest of us, but to us, that person is unique. This book is for the whole family...teaching each of us a little something."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"This book was intended to be read in French. Indeed, that's why it was originally crafted, for students to learn French with ease. Since then, it has become a representative piece of French art. Written at a time when totalitarianism was still a dominant anti-U.S. force, Le Petit Prince is chilling at points despite its optimistic, airy, childlike prose. Don't be fooled. This book is far from childish despite the characters, for, behind it all, each character le petit prince encounters is a representative of a different facet of human nature, often not for the good.I have not read the book in English, yet I would strongly urge you to read this in French if you can. It is not a difficult read. The fact that I have been asked to read this book for high school French, intermediate college French, and advanced French studies, as have many, is a testament to its enduring legacy and the fact that it has touched many a reader."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I've read this book many times, sometimes in English, sometimes in French. I've read it for pleasure. I've studied it. I've taught it. I love it. The fox's secret is an important lesson for us all and one I appreciate being reminded of. I recommend this book to anyone, it's been translated into over 100 languages. (It's been translated more than any book besides the Bible I've heard.) I love sharing it with people which is why I will teach it as long as I'm teaching and I will read it aloud to my children when I have them."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"_This is the sort of tale that a person writes when he steps back and takes an objective look at civilization. This was the point of view of the author, stranded as he was in the Sahara with a broken aeroplane and on the edge of life and death. It was there and then that he met the only person in his life that he was ever really able to talk to- the apparition of the Little Prince._This Little Prince was the sole inhabitant of a tiny garden-like world that was not much bigger than he was. It was there that he tended a single rose. However, this single rose was both delicate and difficult and finally drove him away. In his descent the prince encountered other worlds with a single inhabitant. They were all adults and all obsessed with illusions: authority, conceit, drink, wealth, duty, facts... They were all ridiculous and very strange. And then he fell to Earth. While Earth was much larger and had many more people than the other worlds they all seemed to share the same obsessions and illusions. He found it a place where a man could own a garden of thousands of roses such as the one that he had left, and yet appreciate none of them._In fact, it was from a fox and not from men that the prince finally learned a secret worth knowing: it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. Men have forgotten this truth as they rush about in pursuit of the unreal and the unimportant. How appropriate that our Little Prince should receive this most Sufic doctrine of the \\"eye of the heart\\" in North Africa. May all of us similarly acquire such wisdom in our own brief, ephemeral sojourn on Earth."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"This books is simply one of the most wonderful stories ever written. On its face it may be a children's book, but there is a strong message for adults regarding what is important in life and keeping one's priorities straight. In terms of writing quality, the French version is on a whole other level relative to the English version. Even if you only speak a little French, being able to read this book is the perfect reason to learn more. Je suis certain que vous aimerez ce livre. Bonne chance."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I want to read this book over and over. The story is simple and thought provoking. The story is about friendship, imagination and curiosity. Its also about being a child in a world of &quot;les grandes personnes&quot;.The language is fairly straight forward, though very descriptive. Its a thoroughly heart warming story."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"As every French speaking child, I read it when I was at school. I re-discovered it when I was 18. I'm now 28 and it is still my favourite. You will find no theory, no big philosophy in this book, but &quot;a piece of life&quot; as another reader said.I also liked L'Alchimiste, but L'Alchimiste is for me just one book among the others. Le Petit Prince is something else: shorter, simpler, richer !Read it and you will see that life, every little piece of it, is a wonder. And that relationships are what matters. And simple things. And..."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"At first I wasn't crazy about the book. I first read Le Petit Prince in my Grade 12 French class. I thought it was going to be a little silly story. Well, I learned 2 lessons--don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a book until you have finished reading it! I found that this story, with its silly characters and planets, held a deep message that not even a highly philosophical book could express. The story is a refreshing change--one with characteristics of a children's story and yet one with a serious message for \\"les grandes personnes\\"! It really grew on me! So I encourage you, when reading the book to: sit back and relax, rediscover your imagination and learn a lesson or two!!!"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I have read TPP in Spanish, as a child; in English and now in French. The French is 100 times better than any translation. If you have been raised in a romance language, you know that the charm and sonority of French or Spanish is completely lost, even in a good translation. If you have read TPP in translation before, read it in French. It is easy to understand and a great book for those, like me, who want to develop reading skills.Regarding the story, it is indisputable that TPP is a classic full of wisdom."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I was given this book to read for a high school French class, and I'm so glad I did. (If you're by some fluke reading this, Coop, thanks so much for introducing me to &quot;Le petit prince&quot;!) It may be classified here as &quot;children's&quot; literature, but it's so much more. This is a beautiful, moving story of the little prince and his journeys through planets and on Earth. It contains some incredibly deep philosophy and will make you appreciate the simplicity and innocence of childhood... and make you want to regain that outlook on life. I know that I'm trying to see the world as a child again....Et si vous pouvez lire ce livre en franais, c'est beaucoup plus beau. Le livre en anglais n'est pas mal, mais il n'y a pas l'&eacute;l&eacute;gance."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I do not read a lot of books. I have only read what was assigned to me throughout school and the occasional NY Times bestseller. A friend of mine gave me this book as a gift one day, she said I would enjoy it. She was right - I loved it. I didn't read it right away, but when I did I couldn't put it down. I am not an emotional person, or at least I never thought of myself as one, but this book made me look at myself and it broke my heart. I related with the character of the pilot and I felt as though the Little Prince was talking to me. The book helped me realize that I had forgotten a lot of things since childhood, like the meaning of friendship. The book also reminded me of what love really is. It made me realize what &quot;grown-ups&quot; really are, children who lost their innocence. The greatest thing about the book is that it is universal. It's message is simple: &quot;love has no prejuducies, never dies and always forgives.&quot; It is a children's story but it is something all adults should read. There are few books that can do what this &quot;children's story&quot; can do. It will make you laugh, break your heart and make you think about what really is important in your life.- Jeff"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"'Le petit prince' is a fabulous book that talks about a little prince that loves his planet and takes the advice of his flower which seems to him the most beautiful rose. But a fox that he meets teaches him the most important secret of all life: and that is that you see the real things with your heart and not your eyes, that your eyes only hide the true beauty of being alive. Just by looking at a person you can't tell who they are. You have to become friends and look with your heart to see what is really in front of you and what you are missing. The world would be a better place if people looked with their hearts and not their eyes; and by reading the little prince's story, 'Le petit prince' will you come to know this. It is a touching story that taught me a lot about this world. Read it."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"This book was one of my favorites as a child...it is surreal, sweet, and teaches a valuable lesson on love. The story of lost and rediscovered love is one of the most pure and true things ever written.In this, the French (original) language version, that purity seems even more clear. It was one of my first &quot;real books&quot; to translate as a young student of French, but it holds up to me as an adult, in both languages.Illustrated with lovely and simple pictures of the Prince and his rose, this French language book is a must for Francophones of all ages. The English translation edition is a must for everyone else!"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I am just learning French. This CD reading of Le Petit Prince is engaging and helpful as I learn the cadence and sounds of the French language."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"When I was eight years old, my parents game this book saying it is a great book for children. I started reading it and quit after I had reached the third chapter. It was too boring for an eight-year old child. Well, now I'm 23 I decided to give the book one more chance and... I loved it! In spite of what most people say about 'Le Petit Prince' (including Saint-Exupery himself on the book's preface), this is not a book &quot;pour les petits&quot;. It is too philosofical for children. The book is about growing older and how grown-ups loose their innocence during this process. It is about how clumsy adults do become. 'Le Petit Prince' depicts the nature of human behaviour by means of a worderful fable. A pilot with engine problems in his aircraft is forced to land in the middle of Sahara desert where he meets Le Petit Prince, a mysterious child who had just arrived from his tiny lonely planet in search of friends. During his trip to Earth, Le Petit Prince meets several unusual characters. Each of them reveals something about the nature of adults. The pilot (an adult himself) is much disconcerted in realising he has something to learn with the child-prince, who has a nave look upon people the pilot had long lost."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"When I first read this book when I was a senior in high school and read it for my French class, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this book. I'd heard so much about it. After reading it I can say that I love this book so much, no wonder Le Petit Prince is on some French currency! I've read this book in English and French, and I'd have to say that the French is sooo much better if you know French. It's not all that difficult to understand if you are at a beginning level. This is a great book and is worth every penny in both languages!"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"Le Petit Prince, published more than half a century ago, endures into the twenty-first century as a beautifully written children's novel and a powerful philosophic work that speaks volumes about love and friendship. Written by Antoine de Saint-Exupery during World War II, Le Petit Prince was published as a children's story, but soon became recognized the world over as a profound introspective statement. By using the novel as a type of allegory, Saint-Exupery was able to write a commentary on life as he had lived it. The novel takes readers on a fantastic journey through the universe that, by the end, will have even the most hardened soul in tears.The novel, although simply written, is not simple in style or in taste. Saint-Exupery uses powerful metaphors, similes, and analogies to address the very abstract themes of love and friendship. By personifying many of the personality traits that make up a true friend, Saint-Exupery makes these complicated issues so simple that even a child could understand. This is, of course, what Saint-Exupery had in mind all along.I loved Le Petit Prince and have read many of my favorites parts to members of my family and just about anyone else who will listen. That is the magic of this novel. Beautifully written and illustrated, it will have you coming back to relive the adventures of the little prince time and time again. Through the eyes of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, this often-troubling world becomes a universe filled with the possibilities of true friendship and lasting love."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"Au premier lecteur de ce conte, on comprend une belle histoire d'un petit garcon qui fait un voyage epatant.

It clearly isn't.If you have the courage to read this book, if you haven't already, then good luck. The ending just isn't very easy to take, but this author really seemed to know what he was doing, so I guess it was necessary.I AM a pilot (literally) that happens to live in the desert (Southern California). So I relate to the author on a literal level, but only up to a point.The author is nothing less, in my opinion, up there with Socrates, Einstein, and other great minds. Yes, the book really is that powerful. It masquerades as a children's book, and therefore people that should have read it, haven't. It contains some secrets, all of which (I don't think) most \\"adults\\" will acquire on the first reading. One reading of it just won't be enough."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"More than a simple children's tale, it was my first exposure to a deeper level of the French language.

He meets these self-absorbed grown-ups, and decides that they are too greedy and wants to kill himself because he doesn't want to grow up to be like them. So....he does!

We read this book last year, and I love it!!! It was our homework for several weeks, and I think this book is a great way to learn French!"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"Let me start by saying that this is one of my favorite books. I read it before at least twice, once when a young girl --or an adolescent, another time in my twenties, and possibly a decade later. Lately, I was asked to place chapter 26 in its context. The occasion was a sad but moving one. That chapter had been read during a funeral, and now we were a group of women celebrating the interrupted life of a sixteen year old young man.Because I was given that task --a lovely one at that-- I went on to find my old edition of Le Petit Prince and read it once more. It was a masterpiece before; it is a masterpiece now. After all these years, it has remained wrinkle free. Vivid. Vibrant. Witty. Filled with wisdom.What struck me this time was the structure --the box motif. First, when the narrator humorously declares that he had to give up a career as a brilliant artist because the adults couldn't tell that he had drawn a boa swallowing an elephant. Instead, they saw a hat. Incidentally, a hat boxes a head. They refused to see beneath the surface, or were too lazy to try. So here we have a creator who renounces creating, simply because his audience lacks imagination. Although, in exchange, he becomes an aviator, thus getting closer to the stars. Amusing in appearance. Tragic in content. The boa is the box. The elephant is the content.If you take these two animals for what they stand for, you can say that intelligence (for which the elephant is known) is being constricted. Absurdly suffocated.Isn't that the essence of the whole story?It's all in these first pages. All the satire and the spirituality. The rest is poetic elaboration. But what poetic elaboration!Let's meet le petit prince who asks the narrator, whose plane breaks down in the desert, to draw him a sheep. Although the plane accident is based on a real Saint Exup&eacute;ry's experience, the desert itself is a marvelous metaphysical metaphor for the white page / canvas / creativity / possibility.) When the narrator humors him, none of the sheep drawn by the aviator pleases the little prince. One looks sick, one looks old. Eager to repair his plane and starting to lack patience, the aviator sketches a crate and tells the little prince that his sheep is inside. That's exactly what I was looking for, says the young boy. The imagination of the child completes the work of the artist. In the world of childhood, creator and creation are one. There is a sense of unity that adulthood eventually breaks apart. Classifies. Categorizes. Boxes in.For Saint Exup&eacute;ry's motif of box has a double entendre. The first entendre is liberating. Open the box with your imagination, and you will see infinite possibilities. The little prince knows that. The other entendre is more familiar to us. A box implies something limited, locked, conventional. To oppose this notion comes the expression, \\"Thinking outside the box.\\" So when our petit prince visits the Conceited Man, or the King, or the Businessman, or the Drunkard, each lives in his own sphere, basically unaware of his surroundings and victim of the isolation he has himself created. In other words, instead of giving and expanding his spirit toward the universe, each one of these men builds a box around himself. No wonder le petit prince thinks these are strange creatures and tries to get away from them as fast as he can. Only the lamplighter starts to get it when he seeks the contemplation of sunrises happening every minute on his planet. But only after listening to his oneiric visitor.The desert, of course, is the opposite of a box. And if basically devoid of humans, it is not devoid of animals. The most important lesson le petit prince learns there comes from a fox in what is perhaps the most moving chapter of the book. The fox, who holds the wisdom of the heart, sends him back to his planet and to his rose.But we're not over with the box theme just yet. There is the little prince's body now, abandoned by the prince's soul with the help of a snake bite, so that he can reach his planet more quickly. There is the box drawn by the narrator that contains the sheep that the prince takes with him to live on his planet with his rose. There are the intrinsic motives of life and death, that Saint Exup&eacute;ry un-boxes. Not with answers, but with more questions. For ultimately, if Le Petit Prince mocks, satirizes, poeticizes, it is not a work that gives affirmations, but a work that wonders. It is a work that explores. The work of a writer / aviator.A work where innocence and wisdom go hand in hand.A work that opens our head --which should never --ever-- be a box.P.S. I read Le Petit Prince in its original language (which is also my native tongue). But I have been told, and also read that the English translation to rely upon is the one by Katherine Woods. A reviewer here called Allie Jones makes a very good case of this. So I would urge any new reader of The Little Prince who is not familiar with the French language to follow Allie Jones' advice and obtain a copy of Katherine Woods' version of Saint Exup&eacute;ry's masterpiece. It is unfortunate that Ms Woods' work is out of print, but used copies of her (more accurate) vision of The Little Prince are available."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I place this on a par, in it's own way, with Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet.Deeply meaningful, cloaked in a tale of a child. I read part of it at my mother's funeral. Not that it is a sad story, per se. But there was not a dry eye in the house when I finished.What it has to say on loving and on loss is absolutely worth more than this book costs and every minute you spend reading it."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"Although I believe that this book is for everyone young or old, I think that \\"grown ups\\" will appreciate it more than kids.The book has passages that remind the adult of the innocent little kid within.In a lot of ways, the wisdom in the story comes as somehow a reality check.In depth the book is about life, relationships (the little prince and the rose), friendships (the little prince and the fox) and human caracteristics...I have read this story so many times and every time I discover something \\"new\\". This book is a work of art!If you speak French, I recommend the French language edition over the English one."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I love this book. I have read this book in three different languages (german, english and french). It's a completley heartwarming story and not only for kids! This book has a lot of great quotes like:\\"On ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.\\"You really should read it!"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I read this book when I was in High School a couple of years agomy teacher gave me a bookmark about Exuprey's famous quote.This book moved me soo much.I have always remembered fondly the book the writer and his message!One sees clearly only with the heartAnyting essential is invisible to the eyes.-Antoine De Saint-ExupreyThose two lines I will repeat to my children.I am repurchasing this book mine is very worn out."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I was required to read this book last year for my high school french class. At first I thought the story was really abstract and weird, but then I got into the story. I think another person who posted about this book went to my school because my teacher's name was Coop too. I think all French students should read this book a few times because it really is quite good."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"This book is my all time favourite , a book which I had picked up and put down several times in the past. My mother read it to me , I read it to my children and even for myself.Saint Exupery's classic tale can be read on many levels and enjoyed by readers of any age. He tells the story of being stranded in the desert and meeting a tiny blond boy. This Little Prince proceeds to tell of his travels from planet to planet until he arrived on Earth and of what he has learned along the way. The most important thing he reveals is a secret that was taught him by a fox that he tamed.I saw what has kept this fable popular for so many years. I liked the characters and the &quot;lessons.&quot; I was especially fond of the tippler and the businessman, and the poignant description of &quot;taming.&quot; And, of course, there is the oft-quoted, &quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot; Toward the end I began to feel that I was reading the New Testament but that is perhaps what will keep the fable in my consciousness: that and the marvelous pictures which I still find the best part of the book!"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"Wonderful! Deeply moving and VERY French in its philosophy, but cultureless and timeless in its application. French edition is the best... naturally. (Every book seems better to me in its original language.)"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"This book teachs many things about life. On every plant that Le Petit Prince lands on the book teachs us something new. It teachs us about many different personalities people can have. It's also a very interesting book. It's not a book that I got hooked on, but it's diffenatly a good story. It's interesting how the author, Antoine-Marie-Roger de Saint-Exupery, has himself as a character in the book and how is playing himself, as a piolt, just as he is."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I read this book a year ago with my French 4 Advanced Placement class. It is still sitting on the head of my bed, because I have read it multiple times and refer to it often. I have never been more inspired, nor more changed, by any one novel. The lessons that are meant to help children grow into admirable adults can teach us adults so much more. I looked at everything differently once I finished reading this book. I learned so many invaluable lessons that I will carry with me forever. I am absolutely sure that I will read this to my children someday. The lessons I learned, from not judging someone by what they look like to getting my priorities straight, have forever changed the way I treat people and the way I live. I believe I am more mature now because of the impact this book had on me."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"Le Petit Prince is a magical story of a pilot and the Prince he meets in the middle of a desert. The pilot, an adult, listen attentively as the Prince, seemingly a child; tells of his trip to Earth and the people he meets along the way.The Prince has journey to Earth from an asteroid floating in space. He tells the pilot of people such as a dedicated lamplighter living on an asteroid where night and day last only moments. He also tells the pilot about the asteroid and about how sad he feels as he watches the sunset and then, watches it yet again, until he finally feels better.The pilot and the Prince then make a journey together in search of a well. Finally, the Prince must leave Earth to return to his asteroid and his own special rose. The story ends with a simple request to the reader.Although Le Petit Prince may seem to be nothing more than a simple and beautiful fairy tale it is really so much more. It is a story for children, to be sure, but it is also a story for people of all ages who have not quite grown up.But who is not quite grown up? If you have read Le Petit Prince you will realize that a grownup is a person, who, even if there is a pitcher of water sitting in front of him, will choose, instead to walk to a fountain and take a drink. This book has many things to say that are very important for all of us to hear, however, most of us never find the time to listen to the lessons it teaches. There is magic in this little book: in the fox, in the rose, in the asp in the sunsets and most of all, in the Prince's parting gift to the pilot.The journey of the Prince and the timeless themes this book presents are woven together into an immensely beautiful story. This is a sweet but profound little book that might change the way you look at things and live your life, if only just a little."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},G=["disabled"],P={key:0},H={key:1};function x(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),g(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",P,"See more"))],8,G)):p("",!0)])}const M=d(W,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-830b2227"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/58.md","filePath":"people/58.md"}'),q={name:"people/58.md"},j=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(M)]))}});export{E as __pageData,j as default};
