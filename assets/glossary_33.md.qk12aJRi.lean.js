He also defined the essence of French landscape design -scientific, rationalist-in counterpoint to the more romantic, naturalistic English tradition and based his work on the then state-of-the-art science of optics and perspective. The castle and gardens at Vaux-le-Vicomte (approximately 50 km south of Paris) were begun in 1653. They are the first great landscape designed by Andr  Le N?tre and mark the beginning of the baroque tradition in gardening. Many of the principles Le N?tre tried and tested at Vaux were later employed to great acclaim at Versailles, which he designed at the height of his career. Vaux-le-Vicomte is among the most popular French public gardens visited by tourists, roughly 50 percent of whom are from English-speaking countries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HGRRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Vaux-Le-Vicomte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Airlift to Biafra: Breaching the Blockade","description":"This is the story of the airlift in 1969 of humanitarian aid to the innocent people in Biafra caught up in the Nigerian Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GZUPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Airlift+to+Biafra:+Breaching+the+Blockade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bathtub Is Overflowing but I Feel Drained: How to Defeat Mommy Stress","description":"PLEASE NOTE: This is a summary and analysis of the book and not the original book.

Each of these novellas explores the relationship of the individual to God and society. Hareven writes with great sympathy for the outsider and the rebel, as she explores with subtlety and depth how individuals relate to nature, to society, and especially to the divine. While the three novellas are set in the Biblical period, the author s authority and conviction render them both timeless and timely. In Thirst, Hareven achieves her greatest work, bringing vivid drama, characterization, and emotion into high relief against an unforgettable desert backdrop. Reviews  The success of Thirst rests entirely on the author's evocative and lush prose.   The New York Times  These are apocryphal tales that, at their best, possess a shimmering, timeless quality.   Publishers Weekly Shulamith Hareven was born in Warsaw, Poland but grew up in Jerusalem, where she lived until her passing in 2003. A writer, translator, and activist, Hareven served as a writer-in-residence at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and was the first female member of the Academy of the Hebrew language. In 1962, she published her first book, a poetry volume titled Predatory Jerusalem. After that, she wrote and translated prose books and plays. She published essays and articles about Israeli society and culture in literary journals Masa, Orlogin, and Keshet, and in newspapers Al Ha-Mishmar, Maariv, and Yedioth Ahronoth. Her books have been translated into twenty-one languages. Hareven was an activist for Peace Now, and in 1995, the French weekly L'Express listed her among the 100 women \\"who move the world.

In her innovative book, she demonstrates how teachers can guide their students by showing them how insights from communication theory, discourse analysis, pragmatics, and semiotics illuminate the translation process. Challenging long-held assumptions, she establishes a fascinating framework on which to base the structure of a professional prose-translation class. Her original contributions to the question of directionatliy and to the specific strategies of tranlsating are applicable to not only the teaching of translation from Spanish to English, but to other teaching situations and to other pairs of languages as well. She also reviews the latest attempts in translation theory to define and contextualize ideal translator competence, student translator competence, and general translation strategies. Beeby Lonsdale completes her book by applying her conclusions to selecting and organizing the content of teaching translation from Spanish to English. She illustrates one or more of the basic translation principles through 29 teaching units, which are prefaced by objectives, tasks, and commentaries for the teacher, and through 48 task sheets, which show how to present the material to students.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qW2kiADQhHQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Man Standing","description":"The sole survivor of a devastating ambush, FBI Hostage Rescue Team agent Web London would do anything to find out what really happened that night--and a ten year old boy may be the unexpected key in this #1 New York Times bestselling thriller.

Several hundred miles beyond the Mississippi extended a vast tract of uninhabited country, where there is neither to be seen the log-house of the white man nor the wigwam of the Indian. It consisted of large grassy plains, interspersed with forests and groves, and watered by the Arkansas, the Grand Canadian, the Red River, and all their tributary streams. Over these fertile and verdant wastes roamed the elk, the buffalo, and the wild horse, in all their native freedom and these were, in fact, the hunting-grounds of the various inhabitants of the Far West. Thither repaired the Osage, the Creek, the Delaware, and other tribes, that had linked themselves with civilization, and lived within the vicinity of the white settlements; and here resorted also the Pawnees, the Comanches, and a variety of fierce and as yet independent rovers, the nomades of the prairies, or the inhabitants of the skirts of the Rocky Mountains.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vgyJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trifles Make Perfection","description":"\\"Wechsberg was a connoisseur in the old Continental sense of the word, a man who valued perfection for its own sake, seeing its quest as worthy and its attainment as eminently possible.

He came to America with only a basic command of English but an impressive understanding of what was happening in Europe.

This foundational study draws upon the joint strengths of current music history and music theory to outline a new, up-to-date paradigm for understanding the compositional choices found in the instrumental works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and their contemporaries: sonatas, chamber music, symphonies, overtures, and concertos. In so doing, it also lays out the indispensable groundwork for anyone wishing to confront the later adaptations and deformations of these basic structures in the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries. Combining insightful music analysis, contemporary genre theory, and provocative hermeneutic turns, the book brims over with original ideas, bold and fresh ways of awakening the potential meanings within a familiar musical repertory. Sonata Theory grasps individual compositions-and each of the individual moments within them-as creative dialogues with an implicit conceptual background of flexible, ever-changing historical norms and patterns. These norms may be recreated as constellations \\"compositional defaults,\\" any of which, however, may be stretched, strained, or overridden altogether for individualized structural or expressive purposes. This book maps out the terrain of that conceptual background, against which what actually happens-or does not happen-in any given piece may be assessed and measured. The Elements guides the reader through the standard (and less-than-standard) formatting possibilities within each compositional space in sonata form, while also emphasizing the fundamental role played by processes of large-scale circularity, or \\"rotation,\\" in the crucially important ordering of musical modules over an entire movement. The book also illuminates new ways of understanding codas and introductions, of confronting the generating processes of minor-mode sonatas, and of grasping the arcs of multimovement cycles as wholes. Its final chapters provide individual studies of alternative sonata types, including \\"binary\\" sonata structures, sonata-rondos, and the \\"first-movement form\\" of Mozart's concertos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FekFz8rpTYoC&dq=Sonata&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I do not die","description":"This beautiful and moving poem, by an unknown author, was left by a soldier killed in Ulster \\"to all my loved ones\\".

And, in truth, he was. Part rascal, part gentleman, part poseur, part just himself of all the colorful Texas figures following the Civil War none was as loud, garish, and funny as Shanghai Pierce, who left Rhode Island penniless and became one of the Big Pasture Men of southern Texas. At six foot, four, Shanghai Pierce was big, rich, and selfish, but he could also be kind. His cunning was seldom matched, and business, whether it involved a quarter-million-dollar loan or a twenty-five cent pair of socks, was his lifeblood. In recreating the life of Abel Head ( Shanghai ) Pierce, Chris Emmett unfolds the entire dramatic spectacle of the time and place in which Pierce lived. An arresting figure, Pierce was a symbol of his era. His statue, which he himself erected in Hawley, Texas, is still a perfect memorial to, and a reminder of, westward-moving America. Shanghai Pierce was a man who pulled up his roots and fled to the West, where he found there was ample room and opportunity. First published in 1953, Shanghai Pierce: A Fair Likeness won the 1953 Summerfield G.

The world was lucky the first time; enough of it remained for salvaging in a few decades. It was simply unfortunate that in those difficult years a new menace arose-the offer of dreams-come-true in this world, here and now. There was a price of course. What World Council could not realize-and did not properly query-was the immensity of the price, but the offer was one nobody in his right mind could refuse. Or could he? Psychiatrist James Lindley recognized the danger of dealing with the Devil but fanatical Police Controller Parker saw it as the Gift of God; Angus, whose name and face changed as often as his coat, saw it as a fine game to be played, while Commissioner Ferendija saw it as an exercise in pragmatism-and Security Tech Sanders lost everything he believed in as the welter of guilt and disillusionment swallowed him whole. Under the pressure of decision the cracks showed in the highest echelons of the proud Ethical Culture. Is there a benefit so great that, if the price were the end of homo sapiens, we would pay it? George Turner's Beloved Son was the first volume in what is now recognized as on of the outstanding science fiction achievements of the past decade.

The silence she kept until September 11's apocalypse in her Manhattan house. She breaks it with a deafening noise. In Europe this book has caused and causes a turmoil never registered in decades. Polemics, discussion, debates, hearty consents and praises, wild attacks. And a million copies sold in Italy where it still is at the bestsellers' top. Hundreds of thousands in France, in Germany, in Spain: the other countries where it has become the Number one Bestseller. Around a dozen translations will soon appear. With her well-known courage Oriana Fallaci faces the themes unchained by the Islamic terrorism: the contrast and, in her opinion, incompatibility between the Islamic world and the Western world; the global reality of the Jihad and the lack of response, the lenience of the West. With her brutal sincerity she hurls pitiless accusations, vehement invectives, and denounces the uncomfortable truths that all of us know but never dare to express. With her rigorous logic, lucidity of mind, she defends our culture and blames what she calls our blindness, our deafness, our masochism, the conformism and the arrogance of the Politically Correct. With the poetry of a prophet like a modern Cassandra she says it in the form of a letter addressed to all of us. The text is enriched by a dramatic preface in which Oriana Fallaci reveals how The Rage and the Pride was born, grew up, and detachedly calls it \\"my small book.\\" In addition, a preface in which she tells significant episodes of her extraordinary life and explains her unreachable isolation, her demanding and inflexible choices. Because of this too, what she calls \\"my small book\\" is in reality a great book. A precious book, a book that shakes our conscience. It is also the portrait of a soul. Her soul. No doubt it will remain as a thorn pierced inside our brains and our hearts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_CTxWi4qK0oC&dq=The+Rage+and+the+Pride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Guide to Eastern Philosophy and Religion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The cat and the bird in the hat","description":"After quarrelling over ownership of a hat, Spats the cat and Bird find that by sharing it they create a wonderful friendship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4FoKQgAACAAJ&dq=The+cat+and+the+bird+in+the+hat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operette Morali (Biblioteca Italiana) (English and Italian Edition)","description":"This series is conceived as a library of bilingual editions of works chosen for their importance to Italian literature and to the international tradition of art and thought Italy has nurtured.

By examining black Americans' attitudes toward and responses to these liberation struggles, James Meriwether probes the shifting meaning of Africa in the intellectual, political, and social lives of African Americans. Paying particular attention to such important figures and organizations as W. E. B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., and the NAACP, Meriwether incisively utilizes the black press, personal correspondence, and oral histories to render a remarkably nuanced and diverse portrait of African American opinion. Meriwether builds the book around seminal episodes in modern African history, including nonviolent protests against apartheid in South Africa, the Mau Mau war in Kenya, Ghana's drive for independence under Kwame Nkrumah, and Patrice Lumumba's murder in the Congo. Viewing these events within the context of their own changing lives, especially in regard to the U.S. civil rights struggle, African Americans have continually reconsidered their relationship to contemporary Africa and vigorously debated how best to translate their concerns into action in the international arena. Grounded in black Americans' encounters with Africa, this transnational history sits astride the leading issues of the twentieth century: race, civil rights, anticolonialism, and the intersections of domestic race relations and U.S. foreign relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AuycVJTHtQMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit World","description":"WITH A BRAND NEW LOOK!

Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humor, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue","description":"D.C.

Both Christian educators and parents will find proven help in creating a positive learning atmosphere through methods pioneered by Charlotte Mason that show how to develop a child's natural love of learning.

In Amelie Nothomb's new novel, The Character of Rain, we learn that divinity is a difficult thing from which to recover, particularly if, like the child in this story, you have spent the first tow and a half years of life in a nearly vegetative state. \\"I remember everything that happened to me after the age of two and one-half,\\" the narrator tells us. She means this literally. Once jolted out of her plant-like , tube-like trance (to the ecstatic relief of her concerned parents), the child bursts into existence, absorbing everything that Japan, where her father works as a diplomat, has to offer. Life is an unfolding pageant of delight and danger, a ceaseless exploration of pleasure and the limits of power. Most wondrous of all is the discovery of water: oceans, seas, pools, puddles, streams, ponds, and, perhaps most of all, rain-one meaning of the Japanese character for her name. Hers is an amphibious life. The Character of Rain evokes the hilarity, terror, and sanctity of childhood. As she did in the award-winning, international bestesller Fear and Trembling, Nothomb grounds the novel in the outlines of her experiences in Japan, but the self-portrait that emerges from these pages is hauntingly universal. Amelie Nothomb's novels are unforgettable immersion experiences, leaving you both holding your breath with admiration, your lungs aching, and longing for more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d3XIOCCLt7oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3CR6AAAAIAAJ&dq=East+Wind,+Rain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychopharmacology of Herbal Medicine: Plant Drugs That Alter Mind, Brain, and Behavior","description":"A compilation of current scientific knowledge about psychoactive herbal drugs. Virtually all cultures consume drugs from psychoactive plants. Caffeine, for example, is probably the most common stimulant in the world, and many modern medicines, such as morphine and codeine, are derived from plant sources. In these cases, scientific research has revealed the composition of the plants and how they interact with the nervous system. There are also many herbal medications with reputed therapeutic value that have not yet gained acceptance into mainstream medicine, partly because there has not been enough research to support their usefulness. Instead they are regarded as \\"alternative medicines.\\" This is an active research area, however, and many current studies are focusing on identifying the active components, pharmacological properties, physiological effects, and clinical efficacy of herbal medicines. This book compiles and integrates the most up-to-date information on the major psychoactive herbal medicines that is, herbal medicines that alter mind, brain, and behavior. It focuses particularly on the effects on various areas of cognition, including attention, learning, and memory. The book covers all major classes of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, cognitive enhancers, sedatives and anxiolytics, psychotherapeutic herbs, analgesics and anesthetic plants, hallucinogens, and cannabis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZeaRiIFbhsC&dq=The+Psychopharmacology+of+Herbal+Medicine:+Plant+Drugs+That+Alter+Mind,+Brain,+and+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Ways of Praying","description":"Bradshaw attempts to reestablish the union of private and corporate prayer, arguing that for 200 years, mainly in North America, we have been divorcing our personal spiritual disciplines from those that we learn in the Christian congregation.

Cast out and divorced by her husband, she finds herself in a strange new world. Both obstacles and support systems change as she actively participates in the struggle for Moroccan independence from France. This feminist novel is a literary statement in a modern realist style. Many novels by women of the Middle East that have been translated reflect Western views, values, and education. By contrast, Year of the Elephant is uniquely Moroccan and emerges from North African Islamic culture itself. Its subtle juxtaposition of past and present, of immediate thought and triggered memory, reflects the heroine's interior conflict between tradition and modern demands.

Linguistic Geometry (LG) is an approach to the construction of mathematical models for large-scale multi-agent systems. A number of such systems, including air/space combat, robotic manufacturing, software re-engineering and Internet cyberwar, can be modeled as abstract board games. These are games with moves that can be represented by the movement of abstract pieces over locations on an abstract board. The purpose of LG is to provide strategies to guide the games' participants to their goals. Traditionally, discovering such strategies required searches in giant game trees. These searches are often beyond the capacity of modern and even conceivable future computers. LG dramatically reduces the size of the search trees, making the problems computationally tractable. LG provides a formalization and abstraction of search heuristics used by advanced experts including chess grandmasters. Essentially, these heuristics replace search with the construction of strategies. To formalize the heuristics, LG employs the theory of formal languages (i.e. formal linguistics), as well as certain geometric structures over an abstract board. The new formal strategies solve problems from different domains far beyond the areas envisioned by the experts. For a number of these domains, Linguistic Geometry yields optimal solutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JUPUBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of the Third World","description":"The end of the Cold War has changed all the parameters of our world and not least of these is the relationship between the rich, developed North and the poor, developing South.

Author Joseph Cali guides you through the basics of theory, design, and construction, blending age-old techniques with modern innovation. Beginning with a brief history of the spiritual and cultural aspects of the Japanese garden, Cali reveals the underpinnings of the gardener's art. In simple and straightforward terms, Cali presents a broad range of modern stone and sand gardens, provides a detailed outline of the history of Japanese gardens, and shows how principles of Japanese garden design could be applied to Western-style housing. With a focus on small and medium home gardens, the author introduces a visually explicit process in which anyone can conceive their own home garden, whether for a single-family residence or the balcony of an apartment. \\"The New Zen Garden\\" is a provocative eye-opener for both the serious Japanese garden enthusiast and the weekend gardener. Dozens of carefully conceived line drawings by the author as well as additional instruction by top professionals further illuminate the finer points of garden making and steer the reader step-by-step through some specific building techniques, including the making of textured clay walls, traditional stone walkways, and stone settings.

Northanger Abbey was the first of Jane Austen's novels to be completed for publication, though she had previously made a start on Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Seventeen-year-old Gothic novel aficionado Catherine Morland and family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen are visiting Bath. It is Catherine's first visit and she makes new friends, such as Isabella Thorpe. Catherine finds herself pursued by Isabella's brother, the rough-mannered, slovenly John Thorpe, and by her real love interest, Henry Tilney. She also becomes friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry's younger sister. Henry captivates her with his view on novels and his knowledge of history and the world. General Tilney (Henry and Eleanor's father) invites Catherine to visit their estate, Northanger Abbey, which, from her reading of Ann Radcliffe's Gothic novel The Mysteries of Udolpho, she expects to be dark, ancient and full of Gothic horrors and fantastical mystery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WN4CoQEACAAJ&dq=Northanger+Abbey%3B+Complete+and+Unabridged&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Jewish Spirituality (Reappraisals in Jewish Social and Intellectual History)","description":"American cities are in the midst of fundamental changes. De-industrialization of large, aging cities has been enormously disruptive for urban communities, which are being increasingly fragmented. Though often overlooked, religious organizations are important actors, both culturally and politically in the restructuring metropolis. Public Religion and Urban Transformation provides a sweeping view of urban religion in response to these transformations. Drawing on a massive study of over seventy-five congregations in urban neighborhoods, this volume provides the most comprehensive picture available of urban places of worship-from mosques and gurdwaras to churches and synagogues-within one city. Revisiting the primary site of research for the early members of the Chicago School of urban sociology, the volume focuses on Chicago, which provides an exceptionally clear lens on the ways in which religious organizations both reflect and contribute to changes in American pluralism. From the churches of a Mexican American neighborhood and of the Black middle class to communities shared by Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Muslims and the rise of \\"megachurches,\\" Public Religion and Urban Transformation illuminates the complex interactions among religion, urban structure, and social change at this extraordinary episode in the history of urban America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wW8VCgAAQBAJ&dq=Rabbi+Abraham+Isaac+Kook+and+Jewish+Spirituality+(Reappraisals+in+Jewish+Social+and+Intellectual+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dance of Anger: A Woman's Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships","description":"The renowned classic and New York Times bestseller Anger is something we feel.

This visit to Seaport will change your life.   Janelle Clare Schneider, Author Story Behind the Book  My novels don t come to me ahead of time; each book flows off the tips of my fingers as I sit down and begin to  feel  the issues deep inside myself. For me, the most intriguing aspect of my writing style is that I don t plan and outline the stories. I turn my fingers loose and get inside the characters and instinctively know where I need to go. After all the suspense is said and done, my hope is that each story will give us pause. That in the deepest part of our souls, we ll embrace the depth of what it means to be believers and then be moved to share its powerful simplicity with those who struggle without hope. I want Eye of the Beholder to take readers inside my characters  hearts and minds so they will take an honest look at whether they show favoritism to people of higher social standing. I want them to realize a person s intrinsic value has nothing to do with social class.

What Mama Taught Me states that only by understanding one's place in the world can one become free in mind and spirit, which is the path to true success. Brown argues that by following other people's rules, we betray ourselves and our desires, resulting in a vicious cycle of disconnection, unhappiness, and spiritual death.

He is given minimal aid by the governor of the vast territory that is proudly named New France but is in reality still ruled by the Huron, Iroquois, and Algonkin tribes who have roamed it since the dawn of time and whom the French call Savages. His mission is to reach and bring salvation to an isolatied Huron tribe decimated by disease in the far north before incoming winter closes off his path to them.

High-tech executives agree that a critical factor that drives the company to such a failure is the breakdown of interaction between marketing and engineering. This book is predicated on the notion that the success of execution lies neither in the technology nor in the market strategy. On the contrary, it is shaped by the context of an individual, whether an engineer or a marketer. From this viewpoint, successful execution in a high-tech company is manifest in a confluence of 3 contexts: the technological, the customer and the economic contexts. This book tackles the big questions of how to develop the basic craft of the thinking required in high-tech companies. Drawing from basic economic principles and practical experience in the semiconductor business, it breaks new ground in our understanding of the complexities of high-tech execution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Fb7THX0ZaAC&dq=It%27s+Not+About+the+Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Book of Judas","description":"A meditation on the theme of betrayal stars Judas Iscariot, who, in contrast to his biblical image as a scapegoat and outcast, reveals himself to be a trickster and adulterer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L_taAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Little+Book+of+Judas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Lodges of the West","description":"Shows and describes a dozen historic park lodges, including Oregon's Timberline Lodge in Mount Hood National Forest, and El Tovar overlooking the Grand Canyon","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k6oAAAAACAAJ&dq=Great+Lodges+of+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read To Your Bunny (Max & Ruby)","description":"Brief rhyming text and illustrations tell what happens when parents and children share twenty minutes a day reading.

The Creoles Series is a captivating group of novels set in nineteenth-century New Orleans, revolving around the romantic adventures of four girls who become close friends while attending the Ursuline Convent School in New Orleans. Each book focuses on one woman as she faces the trials of life and faith. The Exiles introduces Chantel Fontaine, who has finished her education at the Ursuline Convent. Readers will follow her through the streets and swamps of Louisiana as she falls in love, faces the loss of both her parents, and searches for the baby sister she thought was lost forever. The Immortelles follows Damita De Salvado who receives a beautiful slave girl, Rissa, for her sixteenth birthday. She mistreats Rissa, revealing her prejudice and hardening Rissa's heart. When her family experiences financial hardships, Damita grudgingly sells Rissa to a mysterious Christian doctor, Jefferson Whitman, who is Rissa's adopted brother. Now the tables have turned: Rissa is a wealthy, free woman, while Damita's family struggles to keep the plantation. The Alchemy focuses on Simone d Or, a vivacious young woman hardened by high society life, and Colin Seymour, a talented young man from humble beginnings. As the famed singer and composer Lord Beaufort nurtures Colin's singing voice, Colin rises to stardom in the opera world. At first, Simone judges Colin as a man beneath her standing, but after hearing Colin at the opera, she finds herself captivated by his talent and passion. Meanwhile, Simone's brother places the family name in jeopardy by his gambling debt, and she must face the possibility of marrying Vernay, a rigid young man of equal status who is feared for his skill in dueling others to the death.

Caplan compiles interviews with such noted spiritual masters as Joan Halifax, Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee and Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi on the nature of enlightenment. In the first section, Caplan examines the motivations people have for seeking enlightenment and contends that very often they seek this state as a means of gratifying the ego. This \\"presumption of enlightenment,\\" she says, often afflicts teachers masquerading as spiritual leaders. These teachers sometimes look down on their students and gloat over how far they have come and how far the students have to go. A second section focuses on \\"The Dangers of Mystical Experience,\\" in which Caplan claims that many seekers mistake the mystical experience itself for enlightenment; she and the teachers she interviews all assert that enlightenment always involves gaining some knowledge about self and others. The third section, \\"Corruption and Consequence,\\" focuses on the nature of power and corruption; the fourth section, \\"Navigating the Mine Field: Preventing Dangers on the Path,\\" provides a survey of the ways in which practitioners can avoid the \\"pitfalls of false enlightenment.\\" A final section, \\"Disillusionment, Humility and the Beginning of Spiritual Life,\\" concludes that \\"the Real spiritual life [is] the life of total annihilation and the return to just what is.\\" Caplan's illuminating book calls into question the motives of the spiritual snake handlers of the modern age and urges seekers to pay the price of traveling the hard road to true enlightenment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fI5XDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gay Quote Book","description":"Drawn from the works of gay and lesbian authors, activists, statesmen, and celebrities from ancient times to the present day, hundreds of quotations treat such topics as coming out, love and sex, belonging, activism, and AIDS. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZhYAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Gay+Quote+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children in court;: A study in juvenile delinquency,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nSZQAQAAMAAJ&dq=Children+in+court%3B:+A+study+in+juvenile+delinquency,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jackie Stewart, a Restless Life","description":"The story of JACKIE STEWART is a tale of inspiration and owe.

In Civillized Oppression J.Harvey forcefully argues for the crucial role of morally distorted relationships in such oppression. While uncovering a set of underlying moral principles that account for the immorality of civilized oppression, Harvey's analyses provide frameworks for identifying morally problematic situations and relationships, criteria for evaluating them, and guidelines for appropriate responses. This book will be essential for both graduates and undergraduates in ethics, social theory, theory of justice, and feminist and race studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LDrJDNm2Gh4C&dq=Civilized+Oppression&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House Plant Encyclopedia","description":"In addition to providing alphabetical listings of some one thousand plants for every room in the home, arranged according to botanical name, this guide offers full-color photographs of each plant, detailed descriptions, cultivation and care instructions, glossary, source listings, and hundreds of practical horticultural tips.

It functioned both as a sweatshop serving the German war effort, and a prison for Jews en route to the death camps of Chelmno and Auschwitz. Self-governed by its Council of Elders - with its own police force, currency and postage stamps - its leader was the notorious Chaim Rumkowski. He complied with German orders, believing that the value of Lodz's labour might secure survival for the majority. History proved him decisively wrong: 95% of the ghetto's inmates perished. Those who survived starvation rations, disease and prior deportations were removed to the gas chambers of Auschwitz when the ghetto was liquidated in 1944. Henryk Ross was a photographer employed by the ghetto's Department of Statistics who kept a clandestine diary of ghetto life in powerful and often brilliant images. When the ghetto's liquidation began, he buried them. A survivor, he dug them up after the war, releasing many that were to become icons of the Holocaust's atrocities. But he released only a minority of the pictures during his lifetime. After Ross's death in 1991, his archive - the most extensive collection of ghetto photographs by any single photographer - was acquired by the Archive of Modern Conflict in London. This book is the first independent look at the entirety of Ross's ghetto photographs. Many of the images are what we expect - searing documents of the machinery of the Holocaust and the suffering of its victims. But other 'private' photographs reveal 'life in the ghetto, with happiness sometimes', as Ross states in his catalogue, showing aspects of a 'privileged' life. Published here for the first time, they add an unexpected, complex and poignant dimension to the photographic record of the ghetto, and demand a reassessment of how we understand its social order. Together with the 'public' photographs, and the knowledge that almost everyone depicted perished in the Holocaust's gas vans and chambers, they expose Germany's implementation of the Holocaust as even more divisively cruel than we previously imagined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zqRtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Henryk+Ross:+Lodz+Ghetto+Album&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mother Tongue","description":"The author of the acclaimed The Lost Continent now steers us through the quirks and byways of the English language.

The idea that life in general is fragile is challenged by the hardiness of microbes, which shows that astrobiology on exoplanets and other satellites must be robust and plentiful. Microbes have adapted to virtually every niche on the planet, from the deep, hot biosphere, to the frigid heights of the upper troposphere. Life, it seems, is almost indestructible. The chapters in this work examine the various scenarios that might lead to the extermination of life, and why they will almost always fail. Life's highly adaptive nature ensures that it will cling on no matter how difficult the circumstances. Scientists are increasingly probing and questioning life's true limits in, on and above the Earth, and how these limits could be pushed elsewhere in the universe. This investigation puts life in its true astronomical context, with the reader taken on a journey to illustrate life's potential and perseverance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K4olDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Live 10 Healthy Years Longer","description":"In Live 10 Healthy Years Longer, biostatician Dr. Jan Kuzma and prolific writer Cecil Murphey make a startling connection between the spiritual and physical realms of our lives.

Her empathy for the Mexican people and their land has guided her work for more than fifty years, finding expression in books of dramatic black-and-white photographs ranging from her early La casa en la tierra and La casa que canta to The Traditional Architecture of Mexico. The Edge of Time presents a retrospective of Yampolsky's photographic work since 1960. Reflecting her lifelong concerns, the images capture rural Mexico and its people with respect and infinite care. They function as works of art and as documents of a moment in Mexico's history when lifeways that have endured for centuries face the onslaught of modernization. Elena Poniatowska has been Yampolsky's friend for many years and, in the foreword, she describes Yampolsky's method of working and includes many quotes from the photographer herself. Sandra Berler provides an overview of Yampolsky's life and the range of her work. Francisco Reyes Palma concludes the text with an exploration of Yampolsky's photographic aesthetic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N9AC1qz32SYC&dq=The+Edge+of+Time:+Photographs+of+Mexico+by+Mariana+Yampolsky+(Southwestern&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fianna Tribebook for Werewolf: The Apocalypse","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cKwDPQAACAAJ&dq=Fianna+Tribebook+for+Werewolf:+The+Apocalypse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AIDS in the Twenty-First Century, Fully Revised and Updated Edition: Disease and Globalization","description":"First published in 2002, AIDS in the Twenty-First Century met with widespread praise from researchers and policy makers.

Christine Daa  travels with her father, a famous fiddler, throughout Europe, and plays folk and religious music. When Christine was six years old, her mother died and her father was taken to rural France by a patron, Professor Valerius. While Christine was a child, her father told her many stories about the \\"Angel of Music\\", who is the personification of musical inspiration. Christine meets and befriends the young Raoul, Viscount of Chagny. One of Christine and Raoul's favourite stories is one of Little Lotte, a girl who is visited by the Angel of Music and possesses a heavenly voice. Christine now lives with \\"Mamma\\" Valerius, the elderly widow of her father's benefactor. She eventually is given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her \\"a little bit of heaven's music\\". The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a physically deformed and mentally disturbed musical genius who was one of the architects who took part in the construction of the opera house.

Thus, a profound treasure was lost for five centuries. Now the race to find it begins. Hurtling across the Atlantic, a plane goes down -- taking with it a page from the journals of Leonardo da Vinci. In Georgetown, the home of museum curator Rollo Barnett burns to the ground. Only his young son, Reb, escapes alive. Are the tragedies connected? Are they merely accidents or acts of murder? Twenty years later, Hollywood stuntman Reb Barnett, an educated, art-loving, high-risk-addicted daredevil on the run from his nightmares, refuses to believe so. Until a phone call rips him from his world of cinematic illusion, and sends him to Italy on a desperate quest where danger and violence are chillingly real. Reb seeks da Vinci's Circles of Truth, a coded fifteenth-century map that reveals the hiding place of the Medici Dagger, a weapon made of an alloy so light and indestructible it is worth a fortune to today's arms manufacturers. To Reb, it is worth even more -- it is his only link to finding the truth about his father's death, and to laying bare the dark demons of his own heart. But finding the Circles of Truth is only the first step. Breaking their complex code means matching wits with Leonardo himself. And staying alive means keeping one jump ahead of a shadowy adversary: the killer who haunts Reb's dreams. From the brilliant Tuscan landscape to the lush California coast, The Medici Dagger sweeps readers into an intriguing intellectual puzzle that delivers shattering suspense and fiery romance with the velocity of a 9mm bullet. Cameron West generates the roller-coaster thrills of the great classic adventure stories -- with the adrenaline rush of walking on a knife's edge between excitement and terror.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dwv_g0eaTrAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glengarry Glen Ross: A Play","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"In Shackleton's Wake (Sheridan House S.)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U37HeAoHNT0C&dq=In+Shackleton%27s+Wake+(Sheridan+House+S.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaiser Wilhelm II","description":"Kaiser Wilhelm II is one of the key figures in the history of twentieth-century Europe: King of Prussia and German Emperor from 1888 to the collapse of Germany in 1918 and a crucial player in the events that led to the outbreak of World War I.

One peculiarity is that it does not do so randomly, but in a structured way, with information structuring formally recognized to be a component of grammar. Among all information structuring notions, focus is one primitive needed to account for all phenomena. Focus Manifestation in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese: A Comparative Perspective aims to examine from a semantic perspective how syntactic structures and focus adverbs in Mandarin Chinese and semantic particles in Cantonese conspire to encode focus structures and determine focus manifestation in Chinese. With both as tonal languages, Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese manifest different morpho-syntactic configurations to mark focus. A general principle governing focus marking in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese is given in the book, which aims to give a better understanding on the underlying principles the two used to mark additive and restrictive meanings, and related focus interpretations. Particular attention is also drawn to the co-occurrence of multiple forms of restrictive and additive particles in Cantonese, including adverbs, verbal suffixes and sentence-final particles. Linearity has shown to be an important parameter to determine how focus is structured in Cantonese. This book is aimed at advanced graduate students, researchers and scholars working on Chinese linguistics, syntax and semantics, and comparative dialectal grammar.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uAKaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English Ancestral Family and American Descendants of William and Deborah Hewes of Ouldman's Creek Plantation, Salem County, New Jersey and of Marcus Hook, Chester County, Pennsylvania","description":"This family history begins with Rognwald, Count of Maerc, Normandy, born about 850 A.D..

Against the backdrop of the pro-independence movement, those in favor and against have insisted on the particularity or commonality of Catalonia and the Pa?sos Catalans (Catalan-speaking areas) within the Spanish State. From the Catalan point of view, their singularity is not sufficiently recognized, and respect for their institutions and their autonomy is at stake to the point that many prefer to secede from Spain. Singularity or its absence play a relevant role in the construction of identity, which seems to be key in understanding many Catalans' attitudes towards the central government, a fluid concept that allows for a variety of interpretations. History of Catalonia and Its Implications for Contemporary Nationalism and Cultural Conflict is a critical reference book that centers around the topic of Catalan cultural and linguistic identity. With input from renowned scholars in several fields, the chapters explore the issue of Catalan identity from a variety of perspectives. While highlighting the legal and historical component to identity and also sociolinguistics and political linguistics, this book is ideally intended for scholars in the fields of Hispanic studies, history, linguistics, political science, and literary studies as well as practitioners, stakeholders, researchers, academicians, and students interested in contemporary politics and the political developments in Spain regarding Catalonia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5rkIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Shambroom: Meetings","description":"Between 1999 and 2003, Paul Shambroom attended hundreds of town council meetings across the United States.

They are also explorations of small town America, inspired by the road trips of Walker Evans and Robert Frank. With the full minutes of each meeting included, this is a revealing documentary record of the practice of local democracy at the beginning of the 21st Century, and the strongest work yet of an important photographic artist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9hp_QgAACAAJ&dq=Paul+Shambroom:+Meetings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hyperactivity/Adhd . . .

From the end of the 1860s until the beginning of the Second World War, thousands of young, impoverished Jewish women, most of them from the hard-scrabble shtetls of Eastern Europe, were sold into slavery by a notorious gang of mobsters called the Zwi Migdal. While the enterprise controlled brothels in various locales, its main centres of operation were Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and, to a lesser extent, New York City. To recruit vulnerable country girls, pimps would target villages of desperate poverty, where they posed as respectable suitors of considerable means who had made their money abroad. They would arrange sham marriages to their victims and promise them an easy life in the New World. But once they d crossed the ocean, these Jewish women found themselves caught up in the white slave trade. Under frequently brutal conditions, the young women had to service the needs of a booming population of immigrant men. An added hardship to endure was being vehemently shunned by the  respectable  Jewish community. Banned from synagogue and reviled by their neighbors, the women were forbidden from partaking in the sacred Jewish burial ritual. So prostitutes banded together to form the Society of Truth, with the promise to do all could they could to help each other be buried in dignity. Through the society the women observed religious life together, setting up private synagogues and kosher kitchens. Cast aside by their community, they created their own: a society of love, honour to God and faith in each other. With the determination and skill of her training as an investigative journalist, Isabel Vincent tells an unforgettable and gripping tale of a shameful chapter in recent history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ew0yYFORsLgC&dq=Bodies+and+Souls:+The+Tragic+Plight+of+Three+Jewish+Women+Forced+into+Prostitution+in+the+Americas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aaron Johnson Correspondence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8J3tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Aaron+Johnson+Correspondence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching the Argument in Writing","description":"Offers teaching strategies and resources to instruct sixth- through twelfth-graders on how to prepare and write strong arguments and evaluate the arguments of others, providing step-by-step guidance on arguments of fact, judgment, and policy, and including advice to help students understand how judgments get made in the real world, how to develop and support criteria for an argument, and related topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GGlAYgEACAAJ&dq=Teaching+the+Argument+in+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret of Santa Vittoria","description":"In the last days of World War II, German forces are sent to occupy the Italian hill town, Santa Vittoria, and claim its great treasure: one million bottles of the Santa Vittoria wine that is its lifeblood.

In this refreshing, brilliantly argued portrait, Michael Lind examines the ideas and beliefs that guided Lincoln as a statesman and shaped the United States in its time of great crisis.In a century in which revolutions against monarchy and dictatorship in Europe and Latin America had failed, Lincoln believed that liberal democracy must be defended for the good of the world. During an age in which many argued that only whites were capable of republican government, Lincoln insisted on the universality of human rights and the potential for democracy everywhere. Yet he also held many of the prejudices of his time; his opposition to slavery was rooted in his allegiance to the ideals of the American Revolution, not support for racial equality. Challenging popular myths and capturing Lincoln s strengths and flaws, Lind offers fascinating and revelatory insights that deepen our understanding of this great and complicated man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VkZNFlZAZ3UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradoxy: Coming to Grips with the Contradictions of Jesus","description":"Give to receive.

But while initially confusing, says Tom Taylor, these paradoxes are the key to contentment, a fuller life, and a deeper faith. Paradoxy analyzes these seemingly contradictory truths, revealing not only their poignancy but also fresh ways readers can apply them to life today. Drawing from his own experiences as well as Scripture, Taylor explores each paradox to reveal convicting realities about life, faith, and our relationships. Both intelligent seekers and experienced Christians will be challenged by this unique study on Jesus's teachings, ultimately finding peace and a deeper, more passionate life with Christ.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=stvSjDWniIwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building XML Web Services for the Microsoft .NET Platform","description":"Celebrate Thanksgiving with Annie and Snowball in this Level 2 Ready-to-Read story from the Theodor Seuss Geisel Award-winning creators of Henry and Mudge!

But who ever heard of cutting holes in the ceiling for a giraffe? Running from a dangerously ticklish rhinoceros? Or dealing with a baboon for a babysitter? If only Bertram would bring home a dog or a cat or even a turtle instead, he might not find himself in such predicaments. And his mamma-my, is she frazzled! Author Paul T. Gilbert, who happened to have a son just like Bertram, first imagined these pet-ownership mishaps as bedtime stories, full of laughter and mayhem and wacky good fun. Bertram and His Funny Animals became a book in 1934. Now it's back in a new edition, and this time a troublesome camel joins the original's mischievous menagerie! Children will love Bertram's cackle-inducing dilemmas and the sweet drawings by Minnie Rousseff, and parents will delight in tales filled with the charming foibles of childhood. Assisting Bertram in his misadventures are his well-behaved little brother, Baby Sam, and friends Ginny Banning and George Fish. Aunt Ella and Great-Aunt Jane reliably offer their disapproval of Bertram's not-so-wild animals. Neighbor Mrs. Cree is appropriately nosy. Bertram's mamma, well, she means well. And Bertram's daddy always manages to save the day (that is, when he gets back from business in Omaha).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N1YzjgEACAAJ&dq=Bertram+and+His+Funny+Animals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stone Cribs","description":"Saving the life of the victim of a botched illegal abortion in 1969, Chicago private investigator Smokey Dalton learns that the woman had been raped, a case that is complicated by the subsequent murder of her vengeful husband.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f14hjv_mX0wC&dq=Stone+Cribs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women's Masonry or Masonry of Adoption","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I2J8AQAACAAJ&dq=Women%27s+Masonry+or+Masonry+of+Adoption&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Technical Writing","description":"Using easy-to-follow explanations and a wealth of writing samples taken from real life, this classic introduction to basic technical writing covers the formal technical report and shorter forms such as letters, memos, and abstracts -- and explains all expository techniques in detail -- e.g., definition, description, explaining a process, analysis.

The victim was Gulielma Sands who, on 22 December, left the boardinghouse where she lived, never to return. Her bruised body was found several days later in the Manhattan Well, a 20-minute carriage ride from her home. The accused was Levi Weeks, a fellow boarder who, Miss Sands had claimed, was to marry her the night she disappeared. Two of the attorneys for the defense were Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, friends of Ezra Weeks, a prominent builder and brother of the accused. The citizens of New York raised an enormous hue and cry over the murder: the body was displayed in the streets before the trial; mobs shoved their way into the courtroom to see the famous lawyers at work and to get a glimpse of the accused; and -- when the verdict was read -- few felt that justice had been done. This book tells the story of the trial of Levi Weeks and includes the entire transcript of the first American murder trial ever recorded. It is at once a riveting retelling of a true crime in which the voices of early New Yorkers come to us freshly from over two centuries, and a riveting legal and social history of New York in the early years of the Republic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zzbeAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Trial+of+Levi+Weeks,+Or,+the+Manhattan+Well+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Gray Rain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L9pTnQEACAAJ&dq=In+the+Gray+Rain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's in a Name?: Reflections of an Irrepressible Name Collector","description":"Takes a whimsical look at the naming of everyday things, from people, to cars, animals, and places, and discusses their origins.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZxiAAAAMAAJ&dq=What%27s+in+a+Name%3F:+Reflections+of+an+Irrepressible+Name+Collector&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Four Books of Poems: The Moving Target / The Lice / The Carrier of Ladders / Writings to an Unfinished Accompaniment","description":"W.S.

Yet, important as this is, there has been little account of how feminist work itself relates to other ways of talking about and understanding incest. In Interrogating Incest Vikki Bell focuses on the issue of incest and its place in sociological theory, feminist theory and criminal law. By examining incest from a critical Foucauldian framework she considers how feminist discourse on incest itself fits into existing ways of talking about sex. Closely surveying the historical background to incest legislation and the theoretical issues involve, Vikki Bell delineates their practical implications and shows what uncomfortable questions and important dilemmas are raised by the criminalisation of incest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AjmIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Deception (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Lenore Andrews is determined to expose the identity of her secret admirer, an intriguing gentleman who leaves messages within her journal, captivating her heart with his words, but her admirer, Eric Ramsdell, must rid his life of scandal before he can come forward and profess his love.

Miami Herald  Not only his finest novel but one that transcends the limits of its genre and is worthy of being evaluated as literary fiction.   Houston Chronicle Before Grand Master Elmore Leonard earned his well-deserved reputation as  the best writer of crime fiction alive  (Newsweek), he penned some of the finest western fiction to ever appear in print. (The classics Hombre, Valdez is Coming, and 3:10 to Yuma were just a few of his notable works.) With his extraordinary Cuba Libre, Leonard ingeniously combines all of his many talents and delivers a historical adventure/caper/western/noir like none other. The creator of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, star of Raylan, Pronto, Riding the Rap, and TV s Justified, spins a gloriously exciting yarn about an American horse wrangler who escapes a date with a Cuban firing squad to join forces with a powerful sugar baron s lady looking to make waves and score big in and around Spanish-American War-torn Havana in 1898. Everything you love about Leonard s fiction and more is evident in Cuba Libre. No wonder the New York Times Book Review enthusiastically declared him  a literary genius.

Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author s many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5qIGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memory, History, and Opposition under State Socialism (School of American Research Advanced Seminar Series)","description":"Even as the creators of official history jealousy guarded the right to produce historical texts, alternative histories survived and on occasion even prospered in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and China.

House. The book traces the complexities of Wilson s life and career along with his relationship with House, who for almost a decade was his closest behind-the-scenes advisor and confidant. Through the early years of Wilson s boyhood, his rise to prominence in the academic world, to the presidency of Princeton University and the governorship of New Jersey, the authors analyze the forces and events that shaped Wilson s character and his actions in the political arena: Wilson s first administration, his struggles with Congress, American participation in World War I, the Paris Peace Conference, the formation of the League of Nations, the battle with the Senate over the Versailles Peace Treaty, Wilson s appeal to the nation, and the eventual collapse of his health and his great dream.  Probably tomorrow s biographies will continue the present tendency toward raiding the social sciences for new research techniques... The fascinating dual biography of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House by Alexander and Juliette George shows what can and will be done in this field.  John Garraty, The New York Times  The first completely satisfactory account of this strange relationship... excellent and beautifully written.    Bernard Brodie, World Politics  Fascinating as a study in human relations, important because of the destiny the two men held in their hands.    Saturday Review  It has never before been told so well... Highly recommended.    Newsday  Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House: A Personality Study may be counted among the classics in political psychology... it helped to establish a new methodological standard for psychobiography, signaling a significant step in the discipline s maturation. Additionally, the Georges  account has become a resource for a number of scholars, particularly political scientists, interested in a psychological perspective on Wilson or on the presidency itself... Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House has remained over the years a vital part of a number of continuing, substantive scholarly debates on Wilson and on the psychobiographical endeavor generally.    William Friedman, Political Psychology  [A]n interesting and suggestive biography... two historians have nicely drawn upon psychoanalytic principles without in any way doing an injustice to their own responsibilities    Robert Coles, The New York Review of Books  It is one of the best attributes of this well-written and interesting volume that the authors have managed to set down, as no one has done so well before, the way in which Colonel House coolly took the measure of Wilson s personality and undertook to ingratiate himself... [T]he authors are thoroughly aware of the vagaries of human nature. The impression throughout the book is one of careful analysis and insight... There is a refreshing unwillingness, on the part of the authors, to bury their narrative in detail, and hence the high points of Wilson s career come out clearly, and the judgments are likewise sharp and pointed... All in all, a first-rate volume of history.    Robert H. Ferrell, The Review of Politics  The authors have done their research thoroughly, have presented their arguments convincingly, and have drawn logical conclusions... [They] are to be congratulated upon a job well done.    George C. Osborn, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science  The study is well documented and carefully written.

Rather than being some type of unavoidable destiny or a fate about which we can do very little, the Edgar Cayce material instead sees karma as essentially an unconscious reservoir of information stored within the soul's memory. Although this memory may draw certain events and individuals to one another, personal free will and the way in which an individual responds to that memory determines her or his actual life experiences. Drawing upon contemporary family relationships, as well as family relationships for individuals who received guidance from Edgar Cayce, this insightful volume examines the activities of reincarnation and karma, especially as they play out in the dynamics of family relationships. All individuals are brought together within their respective families as a means of learning specific lessons and having opportunities for personal soul growth. In addition to examining the universal laws of reincarnation and karma, this book illustrates the lawfulness of life, the exacting nature of individual responsibility, and the ever-present hopefulness of personal free will. In the end, Edgar Cayce on Reincarnation and Family Karma makes an enormous contribution to demonstrating that life is a completely lawful experience, that individuals can overcome whatever \\"karmic lessons\\" they seem to be faced with, that free will is completely free, and that God is truly as fair and as loving as we have always wished for our Creator to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EQ0uzQEACAAJ&dq=Edgar+Cayce+on+reincarnation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Study of Walter Rodney's Intellectual and Political Thought (African American Life)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Voyage Out","description":"Purchase one of 1st World Library's Classic Books and help support our free internet library of downloadable eBooks. Visit us online at www.1stWorldLibrary.ORG - - As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are very narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm. If you persist, lawyers' clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady typists will have to fidget behind you. In the streets of London where beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is better not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the air with your left hand. One afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was becoming brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on his arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs. The small, agitated figures - for in comparison with this couple most people looked small - decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with despatch-boxes, had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr. Ambrose's height and upon Mrs. Ambrose's cloak. But some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity. In his guess one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought; and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction of people brushing past her was evidently painful. After watching the traffic on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she twitched her husband's sleeve, and they crossed between the swift discharge of motor cars. When they were safe on the further side, she gently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the same time to relax, to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning her elbows on the balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious. Mr. Ambrose attempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but she showed no signs of admitting him, and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that was greater than his, he crossed his arms behind him, and took a turn along the pavement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xz2WDABvgd0C&dq=The+Voyage+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mozart (Famous Children)","description":"Looks at the life of Maria Anna Mozart, the older sister of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and a musical prodigy in her own right, who was forced by their father to put aside her talent and become a piano teacher to support his ambitious plans for her brother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pxuBQgAACAAJ&dq=Mozart+(Famous+Children)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Social History of the Third Reich, 1933-1945: 1933-1945","description":"Examines all aspects of German life under Hitler, including the roles that economics and social class played in shaping German life during the Third Reich.

Innis had developed an addiction for stealing expensive cars (not for money but for pleasure) and for the marijuana he helps his best friend to sell. When bad habits catch up with him, he is deported to Canada, a punishment worse than prison. Innis is unimpressed by his uncle, who gave up his dreams of leaving the island to repair televisions, chase women, drive a Lada and grow nostalgic on rum. Desperate to get away, Innis hatches the only escape plan he can, and starts to grow a secret cash crop of marijuana and looks for a car to steal. He bides his time smoking pot and doing whatever odd jobs he has to, full of unnamed need and pent-up anger. When Starr s current girlfriend, an attractive woman in her late thirties, comes to stay while fleeing another relationship, Innis  deep sense of longing fixes on her. He feels fierce desire, but also something he recognises as good and true. Starr cautions him, and a bitter jealous rivalry begins to rage between them, violence lying just under the surface. As summer arrives, Innis  suffocation and the tension between the two men are palpable. Though life in this small community bound by memory and blood cannot cure Innis immediately of his anger, the rugged landscape does work a change on him. He takes on the challenge of the wild and harsh north woods where a man can get lost, learns the names of plants and wildlife, sketches and studies the natural world, and diligently cares for his illegal seedlings. As he grows stronger, he faces himself in the mirror and feels an emerging sense of self-worth and coming manhood. He realises he is learning an enjoyment of hard work and its rewards, although his crop might be less worthy than those of his predecessors. Affectionately sheltering the plants from bad weather and hungry deer, he muses,  Was there a Gaelic word for pot?  Cape Breton has spawned a wealth of contemporary literature, from Ann-Marie MacDonald s Fall On Your Knees to Alistair MacLeod s No Great Mischief and Lynn Coady s Strange Heaven. The region s rugged landscapes, rural life and distinctive Gaelic traditions converging with modern social pressures have captured the attention of readers internationally; as they have in the work of other Atlantic Canada authors such as Michael Crummey, Wayne Johnston and David Adams Richards. MacDonald set his novel in the 1970s, when a country area of Cape Breton could still be a truly isolated backwater, the phone service on a party-line system and listening-in a regular pastime.  I needed to create a world that was much more cut off, where it would seem like exile to Innis and where he could never be alone or anonymous.  Innis recalls his parents  fights about  down home , how they would one day love it to tears and the next day complain how it had held them back. Much as he wants to get off the Cape Breton Road, it may be that all the emotions that make life worth living    love and anger and disappointment and hope    lead back to the island. Cape Breton Road is a compelling coming-of-age story raw with beauty and emotion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2uz_BvO3laoC&dq=Cape+Breton+Road:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools","description":"Intrusion detection is not for the faint at heart.

Their mission was to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase, establish trade with and sovereignty over the natives near the Missouri River, and claim the Pacific Northwest and Oregon Country for the United States before European nations. They also collected scientific data, and information on indigenous nations. President Thomas Jefferson appointed Lewis Governor of Upper Louisiana in 1806.

I have never been an exile.\\" When Ellis Douek was nine years old, his mother insisted that he take up embroidery -in case he decided to be a surgeon when he grew up. Of course she was right, as she always was, for he became Consultant ENT Surgeon at Guy's Hospital in London. The Douek parents had the unerring quality of belonging in whichever country they lived and yet they never stayed long in one place -Egypt, the Sudan, Columbia and, finally, England, moving either out of political necessity or out of impetuosity. In 1940 they took the extraordinary decision, for a Jewish family, to cross the Atlantic from Columbia to Italy, on their way back to Egypt. Ellis Douek describes this work as strands of memory. These strands weave between remembrance of the dawn across the Nile and the silence of the feloukas, summers in Alexandria by the beach, and the seeming security and hedonism of it all -between Nasser and the Suez War which disrupted their lives and uprooted them and Bradford in Yorkshire in the 1950s where Ellis finished his schooling, an austere place after the prosperity and warmth of their life in Egypt. Ellis, his sister Claudia who would become Claudia Roden the cookery writer, and their younger brother Zaki all spent time together in Paris, largely unsupervised by adults. Ellis began his medical training there and tried to live the life of a left-wing intellectual, which was perhaps what led his mother to arrange for him to begin medicine all over again, this time in London, during a time of smog, digs and landladies, fish and chips, and the start of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. It was also the time of conscription and Ellis became an army medic with the Black Watch in Scotland, during the final days of National Service. Marvelling at the way his life turned out he says, 'wherever I have found myself has seemed the proper place for me to be. I have never been an exile.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DX_hRAJwpiAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Within","description":"The most mysterious Bronte sister steps into the light in this must-read novel for fans of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.

In southern California, they started married life in 1933 by building a canoe. With only $4.10 in their pockets, they paddled to Central America and through the Panama Canal. Three years later they returned triumphant, bearing a photographic record of the amazing trek that made them famous. After releasing their bestselling book, Enchanted Vagabonds, the two became exactly that. They relentlessly lectured for the public and mooned for the media until they were able to fund more exotic voyages to remote jungles and rivers. So convincing were they on the circuit that their most powerful fan, President Franklin Roosevelt, coerced J. Edgar Hoover into hiring the Lambs as spies in Mexico. After World War II, they launched their Quest for the Lost City, which yielded another book and documentary. Drawing on historical records, the Lambs' books and letters, and recently declassified espionage documents, biographers Julie Huffman-klinkowitz and Jerome Klinkowitz show how the Lambs succeeded in marketing their conquests and films to armchair explorers around the world and how they became, in popular imagination, the quintessential American adventurers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sf4wh-tUG-IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Now I'm Big","description":"Celebrate all the special things that only big kids can do in this bright and bouncy Classic Board Book from Karen Katz.

As he delves into the emotions of the German commander and the Norwegian traitor, and depicts the spirited patriotism of the Norwegian underground, Steinbeck uncovers profound, often unsettling truths about war and about human nature. Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck s self-described  celebration of the durability of democracy  had an extraordinary impact as Allied propaganda in Nazi-occupied Europe. Despite Axis efforts to suppress it (in Fascist Italy, mere possession of the book was punishable by death), The Moon is Down was secretly translated into French, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, German, Italian and Russian; hundreds of thousands of copies circulated throughout Europe, making it by far the most popular piece of propaganda under the occupation. Few literary works of our time have demonstrated so triumphantly the power of ideas in the face of cold steel and brute force. This edition features an introduction by Donald V. Coers. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

CDMA is a form of multiplexing, which allows numerous signals to occupy a single transmission channel, optimising the use of available bandwidth. Multiplexing is sending multiple signals or streams of information on a carrier at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal and then recovering the separate signals at the receiving end. Multi-Carrier (MC) CDMA is a combined technique of Direct Sequence (DS) CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDM techniques. It applies spreading sequences in the frequency domain. Wireless communications has witnessed a tremendous growth during the past decade and further spectacular enabling technology advances are expected in an effort to render ubiquitous wireless connectivity a reality. This technical in-depth book is unique in its detailed exposure of OFDM, MIMO-OFDM and MC-CDMA. A further attraction of the joint treatment of these topics is that it allows the reader to view their design trade-offs in a comparative context. Divided into three main parts: Part I provides a detailed exposure of OFDM designed for employment in various applications Part II is another design alternative applicable in the context of OFDM systems where the channel quality fluctuations observed are averaged out with the aid of frequency-domain spreading codes, which leads to the concept of MC-CDMA Part III discusses how to employ multiple antennas at the base station for the sake of supporting multiple users in the uplink Portrays the entire body of knowledge currently available on OFDM Provides the first complete treatment of OFDM, MIMO(Multiple Input Multiple Output)-OFDM and MC-CDMA Considers the benefits of channel coding and space time coding in the context of various application examples and features numerous complete system design examples Converts the lessons of Shannon s information theory into design principles applicable to practical wireless systems Combines the benefits of a textbook with a research monograph where the depth of discussions progressively increase throughout the book This all-encompassing self-contained treatment will appeal to researchers, postgraduate students and academics, practising research and development engineers working for wireless communications and computer networking companies and senior undergraduate students and technical managers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ahAOBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales, Children, and the Culture Industry","description":"First Published in 1997.

But whatever drove us away was never stronger than the pull of what brought us back ...\\" When Vivien Walker left her home in the Mississippi Delta, she swore never to go back, as generations of the women in her family had. But in the spring, nine years to the day since she'd left, that's exactly what happens--Vivien returns, fleeing from a broken marriage and her lost dreams for children. What she hopes to find is solace with \\"Bootsie,\\" her dear grandmother who raised her, a Walker woman with a knack for making everything all right. But instead she finds that her grandmother has died and that her estranged mother is drifting further away from her memories. Now Vivien is forced into the unexpected role of caretaker, challenging her personal quest to find the girl she herself once was. But for Vivien things change in ways she cannot imagine when a violent storm reveals the remains of along-dead woman buried near the Walker home, not far from the cypress swamp that is soon to give up its ghosts. Vivien knows there is now only one way to rediscover herself--by uncovering the secrets of her family and breaking the cycle of loss that has haunted her them for generations\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wqc_DwAAQBAJ&dq=Long+Time+Gone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peugeot 505 79-89 (Haynes Service & Repair Manual)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sword and sorceress III : an anthology of heroic fantasy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YdwqAAAACAAJ&dq=Sword+and+sorceress+III+:+an+anthology+of+heroic+fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lisa's Baby Sister (Gaspard and Lisa Books)","description":"A young dog is very unhappy about the arrival of her new baby sister.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hgs6uAAACAAJ&dq=Lisa%27s+Baby+Sister+(Gaspard+and+Lisa+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist Hb","description":"The Routledge Handbook of Religious and Spiritual Tourism provides a robust and comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the literature in this growing sub-field of tourism.

In the new fourth edition of Turabian s popular guide, the team behind Chicago s widely respected The Craft of Research has reconceived and renewed this classic for today s generation. Designed for less advanced writers than Turabian s Manual of Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, Seventh Edition, Gregory G. Colomb and Joseph M. Williams here introduce students to the art of defining a topic, doing high-quality research with limited resources, and writing an engaging and solid college paper. The Student s Guide is organized into three sections that lead students through the process of developing and revising a paper. Part 1, \\"Writing Your Paper,\\" guides students through the research process with discussions of choosing and developing a topic, validating sources, planning arguments, writing drafts, avoiding plagiarism, and presenting evidence in tables and figures. Part 2, \\"Citing Sources,\\" begins with a succinct introduction to why citation is important and includes sections on the three major styles students might encounter in their work Chicago, MLA, and APA all with full coverage of electronic source citation. Part 3, \\"Style,\\" covers all matters of style important to writers of college papers, from punctuation to spelling to presenting titles, names, and numbers. With the authority and clarity long associated with the name Turabian, the fourth edition of Student s Guide to Writing College Papers is both a solid introduction to the research process and a convenient handbook to the best practices of writing college papers. Classroom tested and filled with relevant examples and tips, this is a reference that students, and their teachers, will turn to again and again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-QhuhWHhAyYC&dq=Student%27s+Guide+for+Writing+College+Papers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power to Bless","description":"Discover for yourself: It really IS more blessed to give than to receive!

Presents practical applications about how to bless others and receiving blessings. ? Teaches the difference between truth and fact. ? Shares humorous and inspirational testimonies. ?

Fought between creaking sailing ships and armies often led by bumbling generals, the ensuing conflict featured a tit-for-tat \\"You burned our capital, so we'll burn yours\\" and a legendary battle unknowingly fought after the signing of a peace treaty. During the course of the war, the young American navy proved its mettle as the USS Constitution, \\"Old Ironsides,\\" sent two first-rate British frigates to the bottom, and a twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant named Oliver Hazard Perry hoisted a flag exhorting, \\"Don't Give Up the Ship,\\" and chased the British from Lake Erie. By 1814, however, the United States was no longer fighting for free trade, sailors' rights, and as much of Canada as it could grab, but for its very existence as a nation. With Washington in flames, only a valiant defense at Fort McHenry saved Baltimore from a similar fate. Here are the stories of commanding generals such as America's Henry \\"Granny\\" Dearborn, double-dealing James Wilkinson, and feisty Andrew Jackson, as well as Great Britain's gallant Sir Isaac Brock, overly cautious Sir George Prevost, and Rear Admiral George Cockburn, the man who put the torch to Washington. Here too are those inadvertently caught up in the war, from heroine farm wife Laura Secord, whom some call Canada's Paul Revere, to country doctor William Beanes, whose capture set the stage for Francis Scott Key to write \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" 1812: The War That Forged a Nation presents a sweeping narrative that emphasizes the struggle's importance to America's coming-of-age as a nation. Though frequently overlooked between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the War of 1812 did indeed span half a continent -- from Mackinac Island to New Orleans, and Lake Champlain to Horseshoe Bend -- and it paved the way for the conquest of the other half. During the War of 1812, the United States cast aside its cloak of colonial adolescence and -- with both humiliating and glorious moments -- found the fire that was to forge a nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_VQ-OdKGHuAC&dq=1812:+The+War+That+Forged+a+Nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twelve Months","description":"Retells the traditional Slavic tale of the month brothers magic that helps Marushka to fulfill seemingly impossible tasks which prove the undoing of her greedy aunt and cousin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8PZHSTuYnQC&dq=The+Twelve+Months&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Edge of Darkness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dcWum-lxFNgC&dq=The+Edge+of+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return of the Time Machine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T8jnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Return+of+the+Time+Machine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Immunology at a Glance, Seventh Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Calculus with Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RBG3PAAACAAJ&dq=Calculus+with+Trigonometry+and+Analytic+Geometry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Web Services Security","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dUWHzgEACAAJ&dq=Professional+Web+Services+Security&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Obadiah the Bold","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kGnXuwEACAAJ&dq=Obadiah+the+Bold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete book of knitting (A Studio book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4o1WOAAACAAJ&dq=The+complete+book+of+knitting+(A+Studio+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Woods in Color","description":"Contains information on over 275 commercial woods from worldwide sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sRxAPwAACAAJ&dq=World+Woods+in+Color&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beating Prostate Cancer Without Surgery","description":"Surgery is the most common means of treating prostate cancer, but many survivors later suffer from embarassing quality-of-life issues, including incontinence and impotence.

We are moving from an era in which governments sought to seize and control the 'commanding heights' of the economy to an era in which the idea of free markets is capturing the commanding heights of world economic thinking. Basic views of how society ought to be organized are undergoing rapid change, trillions of dollars are changing hands and so is fundamental political power. Great new wealth is being created - as are huge opportunities and huge risks. Taking a worldwide perspective, including Britain, where the process began with Mrs Thatcher, Europe and the former USSR, China, Latin America and the US, THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS shows how a revolution in ideas is transforming the world economy - why it is happening, how it can go wrong and what it will mean for the global economy going into the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HwvqXKveYLoC&dq=The+Commanding+Heights:+the+Battle+Between+Government&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Keeper","description":"A fallen star and one child's kindness lead to a chain of good works that change her town from a dreary, dark place to one of dazzling brightness.

In the mid-1950s, a young professor at Princeton named Charles Gillispie began teaching Humanities 304, one of the first undergraduate courses offered anywhere in the world on the history of science. From Galileo's analysis of motion to theories of evolution and relativity, Gillispie introduces key concepts, individuals, and themes. The Edge of Objectivity arose out of this course. It must have been a lively class. The Edge of Objectivity is pointed, opinionated, and selective. Even at six hundred pages, the book is, as the title suggests, an essay. Gillispie is unafraid to rate Mendel higher than Darwin, Maxwell above Faraday. Full of wry turns of phrase, the book effectively captures people and places. And throughout the book, Gillispie pushes an argument. He views science as the progressive development of more objective, detached, mathematical ways of viewing the world, and he orchestrates his characters and ideas around this theme. This edition of Charles Coulston Gillispie s landmark book introduces a new generation of readers to his provocative and enlightening account of the advancement of scientific thought over the course of four centuries. Since the original publication of The Edge of Objectivity, historians of science have focused increasingly on the social context of science rather than its internal dynamics, and they have frequently viewed science more as a threatening instance of power than as an accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, Gillispie s book remains a sophisticated, fast-moving, idiosyncratic account of the development of scientific ideas over four hundred years, by one of the founding intellects in the history of science. Featuring a new foreword by Theodore Porter, who places the work in its intellectual context and the development of the field, this edition of The Edge of Objectivity is a monumental work by one of the founding intellects of the history of science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aon8CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herb Ritts","description":"Presents a collection of photographs by the iconic American artist, whose career as a fashion and fine art photographer spanned a period of thirty years until his untimely death from AIDS in 2002.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zhqso8b8abQC&dq=Herb+Ritts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malice in London (Erskine Powell Mysteries)","description":"DETECTIVE-CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT ERSKINE POWELL RETURNS--INVESTIGATING MALICE IN HIS OWN BACKYARD.

The social whirl is decidedly not Alleyn s environment, so he brings in an assistant in the form of Lord  Bunchy  Gospell, everybody s favorite uncle. Bunchy is more than lovable; he s also got some serious sleuthing skills. But before he can unmask the blackmailer, a murder is announced. And everyone suddenly stops giggling . . .

What would the Buddha do if he had to deal with a rampaging elephant of a boss every day? That is the premise of Stanley Bing s wickedly funny guide to finding inner peace in the face of relentlessly obnoxious, huge, and sometimes smelly bosses. Taking the concept of managing up to a new cosmic plateau, Bing urges no less than a revolution of the spirit in the American workplace, turning overwrought, oppressed, stressed-out employees into models of Zen-like powers of concentration, able to take their elephant-like bosses and grey, lumbering companies and twirl them around the little finger of their consciousness. In Bing s unique tradition of social criticism cum business self-help, Throwing the Elephant presents Four Truths (or possibly Five), a Ninefold Path, and one useful, hilarious guide to workplace sanity, success, and enlightenment that surpasses all understanding, survival.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kPGaq6Zh8FkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and Gender: A Feminist Psychology","description":"This best-selling text is intended for undergraduate courses in Psychology of Women, Sex and Gender, or Sex Roles offered by Psychology departments.

These stories are recognised as an invaluable record of lesbian, gay or bisexual life. However, this book illuminates their equally vital role as active tools in the arduous project of creating gay, lesbian and bisexual identities - constructing the identities they seem to describe. Homoplot shows how a popular twist of the plot, or a single common character trait, can be a powerful intervention into sexual politics. Approaching these texts with the tools of queer criticism, the book celebrates their success, but also illuminates their chief problem: how the need to create concrete sexual identities has often narrowed the range of queer experiences represented. Despite the ongoing popularity of coming-out stories, this is the first book-length study of the genre. Homoplot surveys hundreds of examples - including in-depth readings of authors such as Jeanette Winterson, Dorothy Allison, Rita Mae Brown, Oscar Moore, Paul Monette and Aaron Fricke - and provides an incisive account of the genre's defining features. The book is essential reading for anyone considering queer literature, or lesbian, gay and bisexual identity in the twentieth century and beyond. Researchers and students considering life history and autobiography will also benefit from its analysis of feminist and queer politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OpPcf6t5rVgC&dq=Found+Tribe:+Jewish+Coming+Out+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Education;: Intellectual, moral, and physical,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-x0CAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Camping Oregon","description":"Moon Travel Guides: Your Adventure Starts Here Grab your sleeping bag, pack the car, and discover the best spots to pitch your tent with Moon Oregon Camping.

On a clear night in late June 2005, four U.S. Navy SEALs left their base in northern Afghanistan for the mountainous Pakistani border. Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive. This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers. A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow by blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks. In this rich, moving chronicle of courage, honor, and patriotism, Marcus Luttrell delivers one of the most powerful narratives ever written about modern warfare -- and a tribute to his teammates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i2Gfu-algOwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey on the Wind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cT15UR3zfrYC&dq=Journey+on+the+Wind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabbit Stew: The Recipe is Deadly","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cena con un perfecto desconocido: Una invitacion con Jesus de Nazaret (Spanish Edition)","description":"You are Invited to a Dinner with Jesus of Nazareth The mysterious envelope arrives on Nick Cominsky s desk amid a stack of credit card applications and business-related junk mail.

In the West, both Civil War battlefields and Civil War politics engaged a wider range of ethnic and racial distinctions, raising questions that would arise only later in places farther east. Likewise, the histories of occupation, reincorporation, and expanded citizenship during Reconstruction in the South have ignored the connections to previous as well as subsequent efforts in the West. The stories contained in this volume complicate our understanding of the paths from slavery to freedom for white as well as non-white Americans. By placing the histories of the American West and the Civil War and Reconstruction into one sustained conversation, this volume expands the limits of both by emphasizing how struggles over land, labor, sovereignty, and citizenship shaped the U.S. nation-state in this tumultuous era.

He just wanted to play The Three Kings of Orr online and defeat the Deceiver. The Deceiver had other ideas. As the land of Orr's nastiest villain, he had escaped into the real world some weeks before when the man who invented inter reality chips actually made one work. When Nic finds himself in Orr, an amazing journey begins through time, space, the Internet and the world of his own street. With the help his best friend Frog, younger sister Emily, the knight Riddith and Princess Rhea, The Net Warriors are born. They are joined by a host of other characters including Bruce, a dragon with appallingly smelly breath and Prefix, a mace with the character of a playful puppy. As for the hackers, who is black hat and who is white? Follow their adventures to the End of Time as they are captured by the Hellriders, battle with the headless horsemen, and try to find the Deceiver before he finds them. Can they put the worlds of reality and inter-reality back to how they should be? A review by Suzanne Coleburn, Reader To Reader Reviews If you are a lover of virtual reality games you are going to love THE NET WARRIORS. This enticing story begins when a Japanese man who designed Dec chips for digital entertainment and home control centers with the latest computer technology in the beginning of the 21st Century changed things in the world one day when he decided to change things with his game \\"The Three Kings of Orr.\\" The game was complex, net based and linked to a web ring, rather than DVD or disc based and what happens next is wild and wooly. Katana assumed the part of the Wise King and while in the game he activated his mortal enemy, the Deceiver who was a shrewd and unsavory character who could change into human and animals at will. Before he knows it Katana is dissolved into the game and disappears. The special IR chip that Kantana designed was installed in a DEC set and sent to the Granger family in a small country town in England where a young 14 year old boy named Nic who has a copy of \\"The Three Kings of Orr\\" receives a special message of help on his monitor screen. Nic assumes the persona of the Wise King of Orr and types the words in the message and finds himself blending into the screen and into the game. What a blast. This fast paced story rockets into the fantasy world of Orr and into the reality of life in England, America and Australia as the good guys and the baddies come together trying to save the world from the Deceiver. Lindsey Hall does a bang up job of keeping his readers glued to the screen finding out what is going to happen next. A jolly good story. Don't miss it!

Yet medicine is more than just a science. It is also an art. As medical students complete their education, however, they may find that their training has been focused solely on the mechanics of diagnosis and treatment. While this scientific knowledge is fundamental to proper healthcare, it can overlook the importance of interacting with patients. In an attempt to refocus on how vital it is for doctors to consider their patients in full, Dr. Clifton K. Meador has written The Little Book of Doctors  Rules. It offers simple and concise suggestions to humanize the practice of medicine. In this book, Dr. Meador draws on his nearly sixty-year medical career for nuggets of advice with both compassion and humor. Although there may not be a defined medical disease behind every physical symptom, Dr. Meador reminds us that the reason behind a symptom may be found if a doctor observes and listens carefully to a patient. He believes an effective physician treats a patient, not just a patient s disease. The Little Book of Doctors  Rules offers insightful rules that address a host of topics, which include developing a rapport with patients, treating dementia, and prescribing drugs. Designed for any healthcare professional, these short rules are easily understood and (mostly) non-technical. Here is a small sampling of Dr. Meador s advice, from the sage and somber to the clever and sometimes controversial. While listening to a patient, do not do anything else. Just listen. Stop drug use in treatment whenever possible. If impossible, cease a patient s use of as many drugs as possible whenever possible. Just because you know a lot of physiology, biochemistry, and anatomy does not mean you know anything about people. If all you listen to are symptoms, then all you will hear from your patients are symptoms. In addition to his own rules, Dr. Meador has included advice offered by some of the past giants of medicine. It is no coincidence that their words echo the message of this book, which gets to the true center of the healing arts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v8zaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Homicide Report","description":"Eve K.

In its present form, it is suitable not only as a graduate level text, but also as a reference book for industry and research use. The area of radiowave propagation and smart antennas is highly interdisciplinary, extracting material from electromagn- ics, communications, and signal processing. This book is useful to workers in electromagnetics who would like to supplement their background with relevant communicational aspects and to workers in communications who would like to supplement their background with relevant electromagnetic aspects. Anyone with a basic understanding of probability, wave propagation, digital com- nications, and elementary signal processing should be able to appreciate the contents of the book. The book consists of nine chapters with several worked out examples d- persed throughout. Chapter 1 covers the basics of cellular communications. Chapter 2 covers the basic principles of electromagnetic wave propagation relevant to path loss predictions in wireless communications. Students with little prior background in electromagnetics should find the first few sections of Chapter 2 self-sufficient. Empirical path loss models that are used in system design are treated in Chapter 3. The chapter includes the traditional models as well as some of the newer models. Chapter 4 has a thorough discussion on the causes and characterization of small scale fading. The topic of spatial c- relation that is very important for antenna arrays is discussed there in detail.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jY8MBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aortic Dissection","description":"This state-of the-art publication is a result of the combined efforts of participants from the International Registry of Aortic Dissection (IRAD).

The primary author is a Harvard educated astronomer and one of the other two has a Ph.D. in climatology and worked for NOAA, so this report must be taken seriously. Recent astronomical observations indicate that a black hole is approaching our solar system. Although the black hole will pass more distant than the orbit of Saturn, its gravity will slightly change the Earth's orbit. The year will become 378 days long. During winter it will be 6% closer to the sun and during summer, 11% farther away. The resulting milder winter and cooler summers are a curse, not a blessing. Heavy \\"spring snows\\" will fall all winter long and not entirely melt in the colder following summer. Mathematical proofs of these facts are included in the scientific report section and appendix.

In Masters of Illusion, Frank S. Ravitch provocatively contends that both hard originalism (a strict focus on the intent of the Framers) and neutrality are illusory in religion clause jurisprudence, the former because it cannot live up to its promise for either side in the debate and the latter because it is simply impossible in the religion clause context. Yet these two principles have been used in almost every Supreme Court decision addressing religion clause questions. Ravitch unpacks the various principles of religion clause interpretation, drawing on contemporary debates such as school prayer and displaying the Ten Commandments on courthouses, to demonstrate that the neutrality principle does not work in a pluralistic society. When defined by large, overarching principles of equality and liberty, neutrality fails to account for differences between groups and individuals. If, however, the Court drew on a variety of principles instead of a single notion of neutrality to decide whether or not laws facilitated or discouraged religious practices, the result could be a more equitable approach to religion clause cases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eQKqecwpHWIC&dq=Lawyers:+A+Critical+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skateboarding Is Not a Crime","description":"Presents an illustrated study of skateboarding, including its history, tricks, culture, and top skaters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWsBAAAACAAJ&dq=Skateboarding+Is+Not+a+Crime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Retreat With Pope John XXIII: Opening the Windows to Wisdom (Retreat with)","description":"One book in a series designed to lead Catholics on retreat with some great saint or holy person from history.

Exposed: How the United Nations Sabotages America's Security and Fails the World","description":"Less than five miles from Ground Zero in Manhattan sits an international hotbed of anti-Americanism. The United Nations was created after World War II to promote peace and international understanding. But over the years, and today more than ever, the U.N. has failed to achieve its original mission. It has failed to address the most dangerous threats facing the civilized world, refused to condemn terrorist acts, encouraged America's enemies, and supported some of the world's most oppressive governments, all while wasting billions of dollars. As veteran reporter Eric Shawn of Fox News Channel points out, the U.N.'s iconic skyscraper is where our so-called allies all too often undermine the United States and our vital interests. And for the honor of hosting our adversaries in our own country, Americans pay a whopping 22 percent of the U.N.'s bloated budget. The U.N. Exposed will give you a rare insider's tour of the United Nations, focusing on many disturbing aspects that have been ignored by the mainstream media. You will learn, for instance: ? How U.N.-supervised funds were diverted into weapons used against American troops ? How terrorists and rogue states seeking nuclear weapons flout toothless U.N. resolutions ? how our allies' selfish economic interests drive U.N.-backed challenges to America's sovereignty ? How kickbacks, bribes, and corruption have pervaded the highest echelons of the U.N. ? How U.N. ambassadors and staff enjoy luxurious and tax-free Manhattan lifestyles and other perks ? How U.N. workers have repeatedly turned children into their sexual prey As Shawn declares in his introduction, \\"I am disgusted by the fact that the altruistic efforts of so many U.N. staff members are undercut by the greed, corruption, and ineptitude of the bureaucracy they serve.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=68DqQA3QANwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garden Ponds, A Complete Introduction","description":"This book tells and shows readers how to set up a beautiful garden pond or pool.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6FTUOAAACAAJ&dq=Garden+Ponds,+A+Complete+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Samson Battey of Rhode Island: The immigrant ancestor and his descendents : data and records","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=21QbAAAAYAAJ&dq=Samson+Battey+of+Rhode+Island:+The+immigrant+ancestor+and+his+descendents+:+data+and+records&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The other side of purgatory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cg7-HAAACAAJ&dq=The+other+side+of+purgatory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Women","description":"Chronicles the joys and sorrows of the four March sisters as they grow into young ladies in nineteenth-century New England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=He3YCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Little+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Argentina (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations)","description":"Presenting an accessible introduction to Argentina's complex history, this book enables readers to better understand how Argentina's history follows and diverges from other South American nations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lZLgBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+History+of+Argentina+(The+Greenwood+Histories+of+the+Modern+Nations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The diary of Alice James","description":"The unknown sister of novelist Henry James, Jr. shows herself to be a formidable individual in her own right.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4FAmAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+diary+of+Alice+James&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edison: A Biography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iBEoAQAAMAAJ&dq=Edison:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Louis Armstrong and Paul Whiteman: Two Kings of Jazz","description":"In Louis Armstrong and Paul Whiteman the jazz scholar Joshua Berrett offers a provocative revision of the history of early jazz by focusing on two of its most notable practitioners Whiteman, legendary in his day, and Armstrong, a legend ever since. Paul Whiteman s fame was unmatched throughout the twenties. Bix Beiderbecke, Bing Crosby, and Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey honed their craft on his bandstand. Celebrated as the  King of Jazz  in 1930 in a Universal Studios feature film, Whiteman s imperium has declined considerably since. The legend of Louis Armstrong, in contrast, grows ever more lustrous: for decades it has been Armstrong, not Whiteman, who has worn the king s crown. This dual biography explores these diverging legacies in the context of race, commerce, and the history of early jazz. Early jazz, Berrett argues, was not a story of black innovators and white usurpers. In this book, a much richer, more complicated story emerges a story of cross-influences, sidemen, sundry movers and shakers who were all part of a collective experience that transcended the category of race. In the world of early jazz, Berrett contends, kingdoms had no borders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sXdsTTQqUjkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Babe in Paradise: Fiction","description":"A debut collection of short stories journeys into the lives of characters who live on the periphery of the glamour and success of modern-day Los Angeles in such works as \\"What I Saw from Where I Stood\\" about a young couple confronting the loss of a child and the title story about a woman faced with the complete annihilation of her past as fire threatens to engulf her home.

Vardaman Bundren ate bananas in Faulkner s Jefferson, and the Invisible Man dined on a sweet potato in Harlem. Although food and stories may be two of the most prominent cultural products associated with the South, the connections between them have not been thoroughly explored until now. Southern food has become the subject of increasingly self-conscious intellectual consideration. The Southern Foodways Alliance, the Southern Food and Beverage Museum, food-themed issues of Oxford American and Southern Cultures, and a spate of new scholarly and popular books demonstrate this interest. Writing in the Kitchen explores the relationship between food and literature and makes a major contribution to the study of both southern literature and of southern foodways and culture more widely. This collection examines food writing in a range of literary expressions, including cookbooks, agricultural journals, novels, stories, and poems. Contributors interpret how authors use food to explore the changing South, considering the ways race, ethnicity, class, gender, and region affect how and what people eat. They describe foods from specific southern places such as New Orleans and Appalachia, engage both the historical and contemporary South, and study the food traditions of ethnicities as they manifest through the written word.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nv4aBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ashes, Ashes","description":"A thrilling tale of adventure, romance, and one girl's unyielding courage through the darkest of nightmares.Epidemics, floods, droughts--for sixteen-year-old Lucy, the end of the world came and went, taking 99% of the population with it.

Is this view correct? In fact, scholar Terry Mortenson has done fascinating original research on this subject in England, and documents that several leading, pre-Darwin scholars and scientists, known as  scriptural geologists  did not believe in long ages for the earth. Mortenson sheds light on the following: Before Darwin, what did the Church believe about the age of the earth? Why did it believe this way? What was the controversy that rocked the Church in 19th-century England? Who were the  scriptural geologists ? What influences did the Church contend with even before Darwin s book? What is the stance of the Church today? This book is a thoroughly researched work of reference for every library - certainly every creationist library. Terry Mortenson spent much time and work on this project in both the United States and Great Britain. The history of the Church and evolution is fascinating, and it is interesting to see not only the tremendous influence that evolution has had on the Church, but on society as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BLDY_fpv7B8C&dq=The+Great+Turning+Point&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment (Penguin Classics)","description":"This classic, begun as a novel concerned with the psychology of a crime and the process of guilt, surpasses itself to take on the tragic force of myth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SYu-4-oO3h8C&dq=Crime+and+Punishment+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Aid for the Internal Medicine Boards (First Aid Series)","description":"The insider's guide to acing the internal medicine boards written by physicians who passed The perfect framework for score-boosting, time-efficient review, First Aid for the Internal Medicine Boards, Fourth Edition delivers the high-yield information, mnemonics, and visual aids necessary to excel on the exam.

One of these, Caeril Patersone, is sufficiently skilled to compete for the title of champion, but in this quest he must contend with not only his competition but also a conniving financier in league with a sordid nobleman, not to mention the ravishing girl they have enlisted to further their interests.

The immunity from suit of the sovereign, Blackstone taught, is necessary to preserve the people's idea that the sovereign is \\"a superior being.\\" Promoting the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity to constitutional status, the current Supreme Court has used it to shield the states from damages for age discrimination, disability discrimination, and the violation of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and fair labor standards. Not just the states themselves, but every state-sponsored entity--a state insurance scheme, a state university's research lab, the Idaho Potato Commission has been insulated from paying damages in tort or contract. Sovereign immunity, as Noonan puts it, has metastasized. \\"It only hurts when you think about it,\\" Noonan's Yalewoman remarks. Crippled by the states' immunity, Congress has been further brought to heel by the Supreme Court's recent invention of two rules. The first rule: Congress must establish a documentary record that a national evil exists before Congress can legislate to protect life, liberty, or property under the Fourteenth Amendment. The second rule: The response of Congress to the evil must then be both \\"congruent\\" and \\"proportionate.\\" The Supreme Court determines whether these standards are met, thereby making itself the master monitor of national legislation. Even legislation under the Commerce Clause has been found wanting, illustrated here by the story of Christy Brzonkala's attempt to redress multiple rapes at a state university by invoking the Violence Against Women Act. The nation's power has been remarkably narrowed. Noonan is a passionate believer in the place of persons in the law. Rules, he claims, are a necessary framework, but they must not obscure law's task of giving justice to persons. His critique of Supreme Court doctrine is driven by this conviction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jUDKlMPJVk8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Summoning God (Anasazi Mysteries (Prebound))","description":"Archaeologist Dusty Stewart calls on his arch nemesis, Dr. Maureen Cole, hoping she can help unravel the mystery of a ceremonial chamber filled with the burned bodies of thirty-three children and two adults.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EsJjPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Summoning+God+(Anasazi+Mysteries+(Prebound))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perceptions and Judgements, 1939-1944 (The Collected Essays and Criticism, Vol 1)","description":"Clement Greenberg (19091994), champion of abstract expressionism and modernism of Pollock, Mir , and Matisse has been esteemed by many as the greatest art critic of the second half of the twentieth century, and possibly the greatest art critic of all time.

Mordecai Richler s final book pays homage to his personal heroes and celebrates a writer s love of sport with his trademark irascibility, humour and acuity. Even while writing his bestselling novels, Mordecai Richler nurtured his obsession with sports, writing brilliantly on ice hockey, baseball, salmon fishing, bodybuilding, and wrestling for such publications as GQ, Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, Inside Sports, Commentary, and The New York Review of Books. Mordecai himself chose the pieces to include in Dispatches from the Sporting Life, and together they give us an intimate portrait of a man who admired the players and prized the struggle of sport -- as much as he enjoyed skewering those who made a mockery of its principles. His encounters with Pete Rose, Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe ( Mr. Elbows the big guy with the ginger-ale bottle shoulders ) are by turns bizarre, moving and uproarious. Richler travelled with Guy LaFleur s Montreal Canadiens ( Les Canadiens sont l ! ), but also with the  far-from-incomparable  Trail Smoke Eaters to Stockholm for the world hockey championships, where Canadians are  widely known, and widely disliked.  There are wonderful pieces here about Ring Lardner, George Plimpton, Hank Greenberg and lady umpires, and a marvellous essay on his unlimited enthusiasm for the all-inclusive Encyclopedia of Jews in Sports, which includes among its champions Sandy Koufax,  who may well be the greatest pitcher of all time, regardless of race, colour or creed,  as well as one Steve Allan Hertz, an infielder who played five total games in Houston in 1964 and had a batting average of .000.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lsq3aafPpbsC&dq=Dispatches+from+the+Sporting+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Completing the Revolution: A Vision for Victory in 2000","description":"Twice in the past generation, the Republican party has proclaimed a \\"revolution\\" in American politics. In 1980, Ronald Reagan won a landslide victory on a platform of tax cuts, smaller government, and a stronger defense. And in 1994, Newt Gingrich took up the revolutionary mantle, tossing out the Democratic Congress and proclaiming the end of \\"business as usual\\" in Washington. As the 2000 presidential election draws near, the optimism of those heady days seems like ancient history. The Reagan years are a dim memory, and the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill after five years in power has failed to enact the Contract with America. In 2000, the GOP faces not only the possibility of a third consecutive presidential defeat but the prospect of losing its House majority as well. The time for dithering is over, and the time for action is now. Completing the Revolution is Robert Novak's manifesto for a Republican victory in November and for implementing a conservative vision for government in the years to come. He brings to his analysis the combativeness familiar to those who watch him on CNN's Crossfire, and the insight and perspective that have helped to make him one of America's leading political columnists. He is not afraid to criticize the various presidential candidates or the Republican leaders in Congress, especially those who fail to stand up for the party's principles -- whom he calls \\"Clintonized Republicans.\\" At the center of Completing the Revolution is Novak's bold proposal for a new Republican agenda, one that remains true to the party's core values and can command a majority in the country. He offers surprising and original perspectives on taxes, Social Security, abortion, campaign finance, race and gender politics, and term limits, among other issues. He also lays bare the fault lines that have emerged in the 2000 presidential race and shows how they offer the party a stark choice: division and defeat, or principled victory. The road to the White House, Novak admonishes, requires one thing above all, from candidates and supporters alike: the courage to stick to real Republican principles. For any conservative who cares about the direction of public life in America, Robert Novak has provided the essential guide to our nation's millennial election.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2eIXokiwkxsC&dq=Completing+the+Revolution:+A+Vision+for+Victory+in+2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cross Of Christ","description":"Why should the cross an object of Roman distaste and Jewish disgust be the emblem of our worship and the axiom of our faith?

Piranesi, however, is not simply recreated in his time; instead, he travels throughout time and throughout the world, musing over art and aesthetics, attacking his enemies, and ruminating over his thwarted dream of becoming an architect. Appearing in contemporary Australia, in ancient Egypt, and even in Vancouver, Piranesi gives full reign to his dreams and his meditations. He envisions--posthumously--the construction of a great city in the Australian desert. He attacks his contemporary, the critic Johannes Winckelmann, with intense hatred, condemning his admiration of classical Greek architecture. Forced to work as an engraver--the medium in which he created the dungeon and prison scenes he is best known for today--Piranesi labors, embittered and frustrated, always yearning to fulfill himself as an architect. Piranesi's Dream is the story of an artist and of a visionary of ages past and present.

STEPHENS.","description":"PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TBVnDkF957oC&dq=LIFE+OF+ALEXANDER+H.+STEPHENS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WHEN THE JAYBIRD SINGS: A Story of Savannah","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x95ftwAACAAJ&dq=WHEN+THE+JAYBIRD+SINGS:+A+Story+of+Savannah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men Against the Sea","description":"Captain Bligh and eighteen loyal men are set adrift in a small boat after the violent mutiny on their ship the Bounty","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2BhCPQAACAAJ&dq=Men+Against+the+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collected Stories of Benedict Kiely","description":"\\"The first meaning of 'the state of Ireland' is that it's a place where stories are still told, deliciously and by masters of the art, of whom Benedict Kiely is one, perhaps the foremost.\\"--Guy Davenport, New York Times Book Review This treasure chest of a book contains the complete short stories and novellas by Benedict Kiely's, one of the great storytellers of our time and any nation.

Both Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights have won lofty places in the pantheon and stirred the romantic sensibilities of generations of readers. For the first time ever, Penguin Classics unites these two enduring favorites with the lesser known but no less powerful work by their youngest sister, Anne. Drawn from Anne's own experiences as a governess, Agnes Grey offers a compelling view of Victorian chauvinism and materialism. Its inclusion makes The Bront? Sisters a must-have volume for anyone fascinated by this singularly talented family. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Erich Fromm Are we primarily determined by nature or nurture? What are the best ways that people can live productively? In Man for Himself, renowned social philosopher Erich Fromm posits: With the gifts of self-consciousness and imagination, any individual can give his or her own unique answer. This answer is rooted in our human nature, and should correspond to mankind s powers of reason and love. Therefore, Fromm reasons,  living itself is an art.  In his humanistic concept of man, Fromm describes various character orientations that are to be found in Western culture. For the first time, Fromm analyzes the parallels between economic concepts of market value and how we value others and ourselves the idea of personality as a commodity. He argues for a return to humanistic ethics, and discusses issues such as the question of conscience, of selfishness and self-love, and of pleasure and happiness. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Erich Fromm including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author s estate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MUuKGtEnWaAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack Nicklaus' Playing lessons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LuxOyKOm1c8C&dq=Jack+Nicklaus%27+Playing+lessons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Guide for Economic Issues for Consumers","description":"For each chapter, the Study Guide provides an introduction, fill-in-the-blank chapter review, learning tips with graphical analysis, 4-5 comprehensive problems and exercises, 20 multiple-choice questions, and solutions to all fill-in-the-blank, problems, exercises, and quizzes found within the Study Guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gPxpLFvJ-zYC&dq=Study+Guide+for+Economic+Issues+for+Consumers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Student's Complete Vocabulary Guide to the Greek New Testament: Complete Frequency Lists, Cognate Groupings & Principal Parts","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Arcady (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","description":"A musical desert elegy on life born from loss. Winner of the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Poetry (2003) Donald Revell's new work, Arcady, draws its inspiration from Charles Ives and Henry David Thoreau to create a distinctly American poetic music. Triggered by a series of deaths in the poet's intimate circle, anchored in the deserts of the Spring Mountains of Nevada, this book is nonetheless replete with lush, still moments. Many of the poems begin as meditations on loss and then transform themselves, thanks to the poet's awareness of the spaciousness and openness of the void following grief. The attention to rhythm and the exploration of seen and unseen worlds lead the poet to find solace in the earthly rhythms of seasons' passage and seasonal rituals. Revell's sparse, experimental lines are soundings within which the music of language harnesses us to the present and its infinite resonance. Like Ives's notion of music heard through and against other music, Revell's words and images well up against each other and a profound language of images, meter and rhythm emerges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n9ugeVl40GgC&dq=Arcady+(Wesleyan+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mars : The Story of the Red Planet","description":"Featuring incredible photos and new information about the latest research into Mars, this updated edition of DISCOVERING MARS covers everything about the great red planet, from past to present.

Black Fathers in Contemporary American Society looks at father absence from two sides, offering an in-depth analysis of how the absence of African American fathers affects their children, their relationships, and society as a whole, while countering the notion that father absence and family fragmentation within the African American community is inevitable. Editors Obie Clayton, Ronald B. Mincy, and David Blankenhorn lead a diverse group of contributors encompassing a range of disciplines and ideological perspectives who all agree that father absence among black families is one of the most pressing social problems today. In part I, the contributors offer possible explanations for the decline in marriage among African American families. William Julius Wilson believes that many men who live in the inner city no longer consider marriage an option because their limited economic prospects do not enable them to provide for a family. Part II considers marriage from an economic perspective, emphasizing that it is in part a wealth-producing institution. Maggie Gallagher points out that married people earn, invest, and save more than single people, and that when marriage rates are low in a community, it is the children who suffer most. In part III, the contributors discuss policies to reduce absentee fatherhood. Wornie Reed demonstrates how public health interventions, such as personal development workshops and work-related skill-building services, can be used to address the causes of fatherlessness. Wade Horn illustrates the positive results achieved by fatherhood programs, especially when held early in a man's life. In the last chapter, Enola Aird notes that from 1995 to 2000, the proportion of African American children living in two-parent, married couple homes rose from 34.8 to 38.9 percent; a significant increase indicating the possible reversal of the long-term shift toward black family fragmentation. Black Fathers in Contemporary American Society provides an in-depth look at a problem affecting millions of children while offering proof that the trend of father absence is not irrevocable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l-0WAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nullification and secession in the United States;: A history of the six attempts during the first century of the Republic","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DR8sAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Deal","description":"Get ready for your next favorite romantic comedy, THE REAL DEAL, from #1 New York Times bestselling author Lauren Blakely!

And even if she did, she would not be looking up personal ads. But going home alone for her family's summer reunion is an invitation for every single relative to butt into her personal life. She simply can t handle another blind date with the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker from her hometown. So when she finds the GigsforHire ad for a boyfriend-for-hire, she s ready to pay to play. Heading Home and Need a Buffer? I m the REAL DEAL. Theo Banks has been running from the past for years. He s this close to finally settling all his debts, and one more job as a boyfriend-for-hire will do the trick. He s no gigolo. Please.

Unlike much previous scholarship, this volume emphasizes the quotidian rather than the exceptional: the farm household seeking to preserve food or acquire tools, the surveyor balancing economic and technical considerations while laying out a turnpike, the woman of child-bearing age employing herbal contraceptives, and the neighbors of a polluted urban stream debating issues of property, odor, and health. These cases and others drawn from brewing, mining, farming, and woodworking enable the authors to address recent historiographic concerns, including the environmental aspects of technological change and the gendered nature of technical knowledge. Brooke Hindle's classic 1966 essay on early American technology is also reprinted, and his view of the field is reassessed. A bibliographical essay and summary of Hindle's bibliographic findings conclude the volume. The contributors are Judith A. McGaw, Robert C. Post, Susan E. Klepp, Michal McMahon, Patrick W.

Trixie Smith has uncovered information which she believes throws new light on the Ashwood case. In particular, she wants to know more about Alraune, the illegitimate child Lucretia was alleged to have borne at the outbreak of WWII. The child whose existence is surrounded in mystery.

This book offers an introduction to dimensional analysis, a powerful method of scientific analysis used to investigate and simplify complex physical phenomena. The method enables bold approximations and the generation of testable hypotheses. The book explains these analyses through a series of entertaining applications; students will learn to analyze, for example, the limits of world-record weight lifters, the distance an electric submarine can travel, how an upside-down pendulum is similar to a running velociraptor, and the number of Olympic rowers required to double boat speed. The book introduces the approach through easy-to-follow, step-by-step methods that show how to identify the essential variables describing a complex problem; explore the dimensions of the problem and recast it to reduce complexity; leverage physical insights and experimental observations to further reduce complexity; form testable scientific hypotheses; combine experiments and analysis to solve a problem; and collapse and present experimental measurements in a compact form. Each chapter ends with a summary and problems for students to solve. Taken together, the analyses and examples demonstrate the value of dimensional analysis and provide guidance on how to combine and enhance dimensional analysis with physical insights.

As a journalist, Caputo has covered many of the world's troubles, and in Means of Escape, he tells the reader in moving and clear-eyed prose how he made himself into a writer, traveler, and observer with the nerve to put himself at the center of the world's conflicts. As a young reporter he investigated the Mafia in Chicago, earning acclaim as well as threats against his safety. Later, he rode camels through the desert and enjoyed Bedouin hospitality, was kidnapped and held captive by Islamic extremists, and was targeted and hit by sniper fire in Beirut, with memories of Vietnam never far from the surface. And after it all, he went into Afghanistan. Caputo's goal has always been to bear witness to the crimes, ambitions, fears, ferocities, and hopes of humanity.

Drawing on over thirty years of experience as a psychotherapist, analyst, and teacher, Dr. Gaylin addresses the fundamentals of the therapeutic process. How does therapy work? Can \\"talking\\" truly precipitate a change in behavior? Why do therapists rely so heavily on childhood experiences? Does the past really affect the present? Gaylin speaks plainly but profoundly about the art of therapy, what the roles of the patient and therapist should be, and what it takes, on the part of each, for a patient to get better. The result is an enlightening tour through one of the most misunderstood sciences of our time. As insurance companies limit the number of therapy sessions they will cover and people look for quick-fix \\"cures\\" for their psychological ailments, Dr. Gaylin explains the importance of long-term therapy.

The advantages and disadvantages of a particular low power technique are discussed. Besides the classical area-performance trade-off, the impact to design cycle time, complexity, risk, testability and reusability are discussed. The wide impacts to all aspects of design are what make low power problems challenging and interesting. Heavy emphasis is given to top-down structured design style, with occasional coverage in the semicustom design methodology. The examples and design techniques cited have been known to be applied to production scale designs or laboratory settings. The goal of Practical Low Power Digital VLSI Design is to permit the readers to practice the low power techniques using current generation design style and process technology. Practical Low Power Digital VLSI Design considers a wide range of design abstraction levels spanning circuit, logic, architecture and system. Substantial basic knowledge is provided for qualitative and quantitative analysis at the different design abstraction levels.

Donaldson retums with this exciting and long-awaited new series that takes us into a stunningly imagined future to tell a timeless story of adventure and the implacable conflict of good and evil within each of us. Angus Thermopyle was an ore pirate and a murderer; even the most disreputable asteroid pilots of Delta Sector stayed locked out of his way. Those who didn't ended up in the lockup--or dead. But when Thermopyle arrived at Mallory's Bar & Sleep with a gorgeous woman by his side the regulars had to take notice. Her name was Morn Hyland, and she had been a police officer--until she met up with Thermopyle. But one person in Mallorys Bar wasn't intimidated. Nick Succorso had his own reputation as a bold pirate and he had a sleek frigate fitted for deep space. Everyone knew that Thermopyle and Succorso were on a collision course. What nobody expected was how quickly it would be over--or how devastating victory would be. It was common enough example of rivalry and revenge--or so everyone thought. The REAL story was something entirely different. In The Real Story, Stephen R. Donaldson takes us to a remarkably detailed world of faster-than-light travel, politics, betrayal, and a shadowy presence just outside our view to tell the fiercest, most profound story he has ever written.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O1DYmeBS45QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warp: A Novel","description":"The lost literary origin story of #1 bestseller Lev Grossman - including a new foreword about how and why he wrote his first novel: \\"It is the intense, concentrated, boiled-down essence of the unhappiest years of my life.\\" Twenty-something Hollis Kessler languishes in a hopelessly magician-less world (with the exception of a fleet-footed nymph named Xanthe) not too far from where he graduated college.

In late 2019, his fascination with old church buildings turned into a life-changing encounter with the God he had never believed in, and he was baptised in the Anglican church. In this new poetry collection, Jay details his journey through faith and baptism during an unprecedented world-wide pandemic. As he finds God in the ruined factories and polluted canals of his home city, Jonah is heckled over etymology, angels appear in tube stations, and Jesus sits atop a multi-story car park. Cathedrals are trans, trans people are cathedrals, and amidst it all God reaches out to meet us exactly where we are. Jay s poetry explores belief in the modern world and offers a perspective on queer faith that will appeal not only to Christians, but young members of the LGBT+ community who are interested in faith but unsure of where to start.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bApIEAAAQBAJ&dq=Backwater&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Money Culture","description":"The classic warts-and-all portrait of the 1980s financial scene.

He was surprised to find that yoga classes at home were missing the humor, joy, and celebration that fueled his Eastern studies. Instead of expanding and enhancing the joy of being, Western yoga classes focused obsessively on correcting body positions and developing a picture-perfect physique. Determined to keep his yoga practice true to cultivating bliss and inner radiance, Ross started his own yoga studio and has created a yoga movement in Los Angeles that is, to put it simply, revolutionary. Ross lives and teaches according to his belief that the secret to yoga is not obsessing over whether your feet are parallel or whether you can bend as far as the person on your left can, but about transcending the serious and allowing joy into your life, your body, your mind, and hopefully your yoga practice itself. It's about lightening up. In Happy Yoga, Ross reveals that everyone is inherently happy, but that our true self is shadowed and concealed by the layers of worry that, through habit, become our daily thoughts. In each chapter, he examines one of our seven greatest human fears -- depression, ill health, loss of love, career failure, war, death, and emotional stasis -- and uses yoga wisdom to explain how to strip away these worries to reach your core of calm radiant joy. By sharing his system of yoga postures, diet, meditation, music, supplements, and philosophy, Ross has effected profound physical and mental changes in both his life and the lives of his students. Ross's power is that he goes back to the source -- five thousand years of ancient yogic wisdom -- and decodes the abstract Eastern ideas for a Western audience. Happy Yoga is not just a set of movements and facts to consume, it is a way of shifting your awareness to bring the spirit of yoga into each movement, each meal, each relationship, each thought, and each breath. With love and joyful abandon, Ross offers us a new way to practice and live yoga. The result is profound calm, a dramatic release of anxiety and pain, and the realization that there really is nothing to worry about.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eEOQLfa-sysC&dq=Happy+Yoga+:+7+Reasons+Why+There%27s+Nothing+to+Worry+About&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reinventing Comics","description":"In 1993, Scott McCloud tore down the wall between high and low culture with the acclaimed international hit Understanding Comics, a massive comic book that explored the inner workings of the worlds most misunderstood art form.

They were two brilliant young American writers from wildly divergent backgrounds a white woman with a blue-blood Bostonian lineage and a black man, the son of a struggling single mother and an unknown father. They married in a year that seemed to separate the past from the present; together, these two would snub the histories that divided them and embrace a radical future. When their marriage disintegrated eight years later, it was, as one friend put it, \\"the ugliest divorce in Boston's history\\" a violent, traumatic war that felt all the more heartrending given the hopeful symbolism of their union. Decades later, Senna looks back not only at her parents' divorce but beyond it, to the opposing American histories that her parents had tried so hard to overcome. On her mother's side of the family she finds in carefully preserved documents the chronicle of a white America both illustrious and shameful. On her father's she discovers, through fragments and shreds of evidence, a no less remarkable history. As she digs deeper into this unwritten half of the story, she reconstructs a long buried family mystery that illuminates her own childhood. In the process, she begins to understand her difficult father, the power and failure of her parents' union, and, finally, the forces of history. Where Did You Sleep Last Night? is at once a potent statement of personal identity, a challenging look at the murky waters of American ancestry, and an exploration of narratives the narratives we create and those we forget. Senna has given us an unforgettable testimony to the paradoxes the pain and the pride embedded in history, family, and race.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=43_Ta8b-7NkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bahrain","description":"Amid the extensive coverage of the Arab uprisings, the Gulf state of Bahrain has been almost forgotten.

Packet switched networks defy analytical modeling. The Internet is an outstanding and challenging case because of its fast development, unparalleled heterogeneity and the inherent lack of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in its core conception. This monograph deals with applications of computational intelligence methods, with an emphasis on fuzzy techniques, to a number of current issues in measurement, analysis and control of traffic in the Internet. First, the core building blocks of Internet Science and other related networking aspects are introduced. Then, data mining and control problems are addressed. In the first class two issues are considered: predictive modeling of traffic load as well as summarization of traffic flow measurements. The second class, control, includes active queue management schemes for Internet routers as well as window based end-to-end rate and congestion control. The practical hardware implementation of some of the fuzzy inference systems proposed here is also addressed. While some theoretical developments are described, we favor extensive evaluation of models using real-world data by simulation and experiments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FK30CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World's Hieroglyphic Beauty: Five American Poets","description":"Gathers interviews with Richard Wilbur, William Stafford, Louis Simpson, James Wright, and Robert Penn Warren, and examines each individual's poetry","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hEBQdWjtvGYC&dq=The+World%27s+Hieroglyphic+Beauty:+Five+American+Poets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Impact of the Gene: From Mendel's Peas to Designer Babies","description":"How genetics, and the technologies that arise from it, will affect the way we live in the twenty-first centuryIn the mid-nineteenth century, a Moravian friar made a discovery that was to shape not only the future of science but also that of the human race. With his deceptively simple experiments on peas in a monastery garden in Brno, Gregor Mendel was the first to establish the basic laws of heredity, laws from which the principles of modern genetics can be drawn. In this fascinating account, acclaimed science writer Colin Tudge traces the influence on science of Mendel's extraordinary ideas, from the 1850s to the present day, and goes on to ask what might happen in the coming century and beyond.A comprehensive and entertaining work that combines scientific history with a compelling discussion on the future trends of genetic technologies, \\"The Impact of the Gene\\" examines how the ideas that underpin the spectrum of all genetic issues are interrelated, and proposes that with a basic understanding of Gregor Mendel's theories and discoveries, all modern genetics falls easily into place.

Layman Western","description":"Never did Paxton dream that one afternoon folly, hiding in the woodpile to peek at a bathing woman, would lead to so many deaths. Long was that westward chase. Then with nowhere to run, back to the wall, Paxton McAllister filled his hand. God may have had mercy, but he and Paxton had never met.I was not more that one hundred yards into the river when the shot rang out. I was not hit nor my canoe. It came from the west shore, a campfire I now saw behind some deadfall. There was a shout. More men came running. Five more shots were fired at me, one hit, putting a hole in my craft just above the water line. The bullet lodged in my pack. I put my back to the paddle and made downstream toward the eastern shore. These men were serious. For peeping on one fat woman they were trying to kill me? What would have happened if it were Trinity on the porch? I surely wished it had been. Looking at her would at least give some logic to this chase and maybe a reason for getting killed. \\"A cracking read, a real page-turner, in the great Western adventure tradition of Louis L'Amour.\\" Timothy Harper, American Society of Journalists and Authors\\"Paxton is a great hero, and so is Larry Layman for creating him.

Now, in Egyptian Mythology, Geraldine Pinch offers a comprehensive introduction that untangles the mystery of Egyptian Myth. Spanning Ancient Egyptian culture--from 3200 BC to AD 400--Pinch opens a door to this hidden world and casts light on its often misunderstood belief system. She discusses the nature of myths and the history of Egypt, from the predynastic to the postpharaonic period. She explains how Egyptian culture developed around the flooding of the Nile, or the \\"inundation,\\" a phenomenon on which the whole welfare of the country depended, and how aspects of the inundation were personified as deities. She explains that the usually cloudless skies made for a preoccupation with the stars and planets. Indeed, much early Egyptian mythology may have developed to explain the movement of these celestial bodies. She provides a timeline covering the seven stages in the mythical history of Egypt and outlining the major events of each stage, such as the reign of the sun God. A substantial A to Z section covers the principal themes and concepts of Egyptian mythology as well as the most important deities, demons, and other characters. For anyone who wants to know about Anubis, the terrifying canine god who presided over the mummification of bodies and guarded burials, or Hathor, the golden goddess who helped women to give birth and the dead to be reborn, or an explanation of the nun, the primeval ocean from which all life came, Egyptian Mythology is the place to look.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hgGNb6wM2kC&dq=Egyptian+Mythology:+A+Guide+to+the+Gods,+Goddesses,+and+Traditions+of+Ancient+Egypt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Games: A Popular Culture Phenomenon","description":"From their inception, video games quickly became a major new arena of popular entertainment. Beginning with very primitive games, they quickly evolved into interactive animated works, many of which now approach film in terms of their visual excitement. But there are important differences, as Arthur Asa Berger makes clear in this important new work. Films are purely to be viewed, but video involves the player, moving from empathy to immersion, from being spectators to being actively involved in texts. Berger, a renowned scholar of popular culture, explores the cultural significance of the expanding popularity and sophistication of video games and considers the biological and psychoanalytic aspects of this phenomenon.Berger begins by tracing the evolution of video games from simple games like Pong to new, powerfully involving and complex ones like Myst and Half-Life. He notes how this evolution has built the video industry, which includes the hardware (game-playing consoles) and the software (the games themselves), to revenues comparable to the American film industry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJsuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malloy's Sports Collectibles Value Guide: Up-To-Date Prices for Noncard Sports Memorabilia","description":"Lists current prices for autographs, cereal boxes, coins, comic books, figurines, table games, medallions, pins, plates, posters, programs, stickers, and team publications","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UZlHs1IYCdgC&dq=Malloy%27s+Sports+Collectibles+Value+Guide:+Up-To-Date+Prices+for+Noncard+Sports+Memorabilia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite: The Rise and Fall of the Ceausescus","description":"A study of the rise and fall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, discusses their complex lives and political careers, their reign of terror over Romania, and their fate during the 1989 revolution","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hX-3AAAAIAAJ&dq=Kiss+the+Hand+You+Cannot+Bite:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+Ceausescus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johanna","description":"A historical novel relates the story of the sister-in-law of Vincent van Gogh, who saved his art and his letters to his brother, Theo, for posterity, in a series of imaginary letters and excerpts from Johanna's diary","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3mxaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Johanna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections from the Past","description":"When Abby Murphy discovers she s heiress to one of St Helens  largest glass works, her whole life is turned upside down.

And as luck would have it, this is the way celebrated New York City chef Tom Valenti loves to cook. Considered Manhattan's grandmaster of comfort food, Valenti has made this beloved cooking his trademark. In fact, on any given night, you'll find him in his wildly successful Upper West Side restaurants Ouest and 'Cesca feeding the world's A-list -- Bill Clinton, Steven Spielberg, Charlie Rose, Jerry Seinfeld, Judy Collins, Joan Didion. Because, of course, this is the food they love to eat, too. In Tom Valenti's Soups, Stews, and One-Pot Meals, Valenti and coauthor Andrew Friedman dish up the flavor we've come to expect from a New York chef, without any of the fuss. This is food that gets better a day or two after it's made, food to make on the weekend and savor throughout a busy week, food that is perfect for dinner parties and family celebrations. Here are 125 realistic recipes for the home cook -- most made in one pot -- and all based on the fact that the right ingredients, left alone to cook in a single vessel with virtually no intervention from the cook, steadily build glorious flavor and leave far fewer pots to clean. The book includes \\"Variations\\" and \\"Tomorrow's Table,\\" tips on ways to embellish a dish by adding vegetables or meats or provide economy by stretching it into another satisfying meal by simply adding another ingredient.

Rush FAQ documents the amazing story of the world's greatest Canadian prog rock power trio, from its origins in a church basement in Willowdale, Ontario, to its induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Covering 40 albums, 10 DVDs, thousands of mesmerizing live shows, and millions of rock's most loyal fans, the story of Rush is as epic and unique as its music. Rush has been maligned by the press for decades, and misunderstood by a legion of mainstream rock fans and rock glitterati. And yet only the Beatles and Rolling Stones have earned more gold and platinum records. Few artists, if any, have been as influential as Rush's three virtuoso bassist-keyboardist-vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer-lyricist Neil Peart. Rush's focus has always been about its muse and its music. As such, Rush FAQ studies the evolution of the band's sound, from the early days of Zeppelin-esque blues-rock to complex, synth-laden opuses to the return of concept-album bombast with the critically acclaimed Clockwork Angels . With wit, humor, and authority, music industry veteran and unabashed Rush geek Max Mobley examines the music, gear, personalities, and trials and tribulations of one of rock and roll's truly legendary acts. It is a story Rush fans will treasure and rock and roll fans will admire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KM3dAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rush:+Chemistry:+The+Definitive+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pearlhanger","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S9eCzQEACAAJ&dq=Pearlhanger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"365 Afterschool Activities: Tv-Free Fun for Kids 7-12","description":"From making a monster mask to going on a bike photo safari, 365 Smart Afterschool Activities will let kids' imaginations soar with terrifically fun things to do during those valuable afterschool hours and beyond. 365 Smart Afterschool Activities is perfect for parents, teachers, grandparents, babysitters and youth leaders.

During his 44-year career the versatile Dreyfuss designed or retooled hundreds of products that have become icons of modern design, among them the Princess and Trimline telephones, John Deere tractors, and Hoover vacuum cleaners, which Dreyfuss outfitted with headlights and bumpers in the 1930s to prevent dented and scratched furniture. Additional objects and spaces he designed range from the familiar Honeywell wall-mounted round thermostat to the Big Ben alarm clock, trains such as the classic 20th Century Limited for the New York Central Railroad, and the Situation Room for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during World War II. This first published monograph on Dreyfuss surveys his life and work through 200 archival and new photographs of his designs and a biographical text that paints the picture of an eminently practical yet eccentric innovator. Dreyfuss streamlined even his wardrobe by wearing only brown suits, stayed exclusively at the Plaza Hotel when in New York so clients could always find him, and reportedly missed only five days of work in twenty-two years. This book is published in conjunction with a major exhibition of Dreyfuss's work at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, New York.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=afRTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Henry+Dreyfuss,+Industrial+Designer:+The+Man+in+the+Brown+Suit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The decline of the intellectual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O6NoswEACAAJ&dq=The+decline+of+the+intellectual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La sabiduria de los nuestros (Spanish Edition)","description":"First published in 2000.

The stories of killer spouses tend to captivate us, as they beg the question of how so many seemingly normal and happy people manage to go over the edge. Indeed, every relationship presents \\"extreme moments\\" where scary feelings surface, yet what happens when those feelings turn to action? In Till Death Do Us Part, noted psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig, along with journalist Matt Birkbeck, presents the psychological profiles of notorious killer spouses -- from Scott Peterson and Clara Harris to Rabbi Fred Neulander and Betty Broderick. Ludwig reveals ten killer personality types. These ten personality types are defined in detail and illustrated with examples from high-profile cases along with in-depth analyses of the motivations behind the murders. The ten types range from the Betrayal/Abandonment Killer (who loses control and kills from a broken heart) to the Control Killer (who micromanages every aspect of the spouse's life) and the Black Widow/Profit Killer (who kills for money). With gripping stories and probing insight, authors Ludwig and Birkbeck examine the concept of peaceful versus violent resolution and why certain spouses believe murder is the best and only response. In an age when spousal murder is headline news, Till Death Do Us Part explores a phenomenon that many spouses can't help but think about at some point in their relationships -- which sheds light on the very notion of \\"happily ever after.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2StRZcomfF0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pathfinder or the Inland Sea","description":"In the sequel to The last of the Mohicans, Natty Bumppo tries to help a small outpost on Lake Ontario.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WeFLAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Portfolio Performance Measurement and Attribution (The Wiley Finance Series)","description":"Performance measurement and attribution are key tools in informing investment decisions and strategies.

Now that daunting legacy has passed to John Ross along with powerful magic and the knowledge that his actions are all that stand between a living hell and humanity's future. Then, after decades of service to the Word, an unspeakable act of violence shatters John Ross's weary faith. Haunted by guilt, he turns his back on his dread gift, settling down to build a normal life, untroubled by demons and nightmares. But a fallen Knight makes a tempting prize for the Void, which could bend the Knight's magic to its own evil ends.

Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, was induced to the task by the first President s nephew, Bushrod Washington. Marshall s own principal biographer, Albert J. Beveridge, has described The Life of George Washington as  to this day the fullest and most trustworthy treatment of that period from the conservative point of view.  In fact, so significant is the biography that Marshall later executed a one-volume abridgment, first published in 1838 and used widely for generations in American schools and colleges. The twentieth and final version of the abridgement, published in 1849, is the text reproduced in the new Liberty Fund edition of what Charles A. Beard has praised as a  great  and  masterly  biography. The editors  foreword and notes, together with maps of major battle campaigns not included in the original edition, make this edition especially attractive for classroom use. The Appendices include Washington s Speech to the Officers of the Army (15 March 1783), Address to Congress on Resigning Commission (23 December 1783), Letter to Congress Transmitting Proposed Constitution (17 September 1787), First Inaugural Address (30 April 1789), and Farewell Address (19 September 1796).

Tozer's compilation of writings on true revivals is what the book Born After Midnight is all about. Tozer is arguing that the premise of spiritual gifts and graces come only to those who want them badly enough to wait for them; to those who are willing to pray late into the night, unto that last hour of darkness, just before the coming dawn shimmers on the horizon is a service and honor. These graces come to those who genuinely yearn for God. Born After Midnight comes to those who speak to god on behalf of men and speak to men in the name of God. Tozer takes us on another journey of faith that is one that will have you re-evaluating your attitude toward life and toward the Lord, inspiring and enabling you to take up your cross and follow the Lamb. Tozer lays many of his philosophical cornerstones in Born After Midnight, as he describes who God is and what it is that makes Him that way. Will revival come again after reading this book, maybe, maybe not, but your prayer life and view of God will change forever. This book brings a revivalist attitude of enthusiasm to the everyday journey of faith. A.W. Tozer urges the believer to &quote;sanctify the ordinary,&quote; making every act of life a simple and glorifying offering to God. The book examines the qualities of God and His desires and expectations of man. Each chapter will renew your insight into the depth of your faith, prompting an attitude of worshipful resignation toward God s will.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qz_jsgEACAAJ&dq=Born+after+midnight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Finishing Touches: Stylish Home Ideas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3zRizgEACAAJ&dq=101+Finishing+Touches:+Stylish+Home+Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Arbors and Trellises","description":"Turn discarded branches from your routine pruning into sturdy and beautiful bentwood projects for your lawn and garden.

Smuggling hundreds of thousands of copies into the most isolated communities in the segregated South, Abbott gave voice to the voiceless, galvanized the electoral power of black America, and became one of the first black millionaires in the process. His successor wielded the newspaper s clout to elect mayors and presidents, including Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy, who would have lost in 1960 if not for The Defender s support.

This textbook highlights mechanisms that underlie plant physiological ecology at the levels of physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. At the same time, the integrative power of physiological ecology is well suited to assess the costs, benefits, and consequences of modifying plants for human needs and to evaluate the role of plants in natural and managed ecosystems. Plant Physiological Ecology, Third Edition is significantly updated, with many full color illustrations, and begins with the primary processes of carbon metabolism and transport, plant water relations, and energy balance. After considering individual leaves and whole plants, these physiological processes are then scaled up to the level of the canopy. Subsequent chapters discuss mineral nutrition and the ways in which plants cope with nutrient\\\\deficient or toxic soils. The book then looks at patterns of growth and allocation, life\\\\history traits, and interactions between plants and other organisms. Later chapters deal with traits that affect decomposition of plant material and with the consequences of plant physiological ecology at ecosystem and global levels. Plant Physiological Ecology, Third Edition features several boxed entries that extend the discussions of selected issues, a glossary, and numerous references to the primary and review literature. This significant new text is suitable for use in plant ecology courses, as well as classes ranging from plant physiology to plant molecular biology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SqjDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Education by Uncles","description":"Winner of the International Literacy Association Social Justice Literature Award An award-winning middle-grade novel about the power of grassroots activism and how kids can make a difference.

Begun in Florence when he was fifty-eight, it was primarily intended to be the story of his life and art, his tragedies and triumphs. However, as he was an active participant in the wars and struggles of the period and drew his friends and enemies from all levels of society, it became a vivid and convincing portrait of the manners and morals both of the rulers of the sixteenth century and of their subjects.With enviable powers of invective and an irrepressible sense of humor, reflected in an equally vigorous and extravagant style, Cellini has provided an intriguing and unrivaled glimpse into the palaces and prisons of the Italy of Michelangelo and the Medici.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In The Sixth Extinction, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Mind","description":"New York Times Bestseller ? Finalist for the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award in Nonfiction ? A New York Times Notable Book ? Bloomberg Best Book of 2018  Their distinctive contribution to the higher-education debate is to meet safetyism on its own, psychological turf . . . Lukianoff and Haidt tell us that safetyism undermines the freedom of inquiry and speech that are indispensable to universities.   Jonathan Marks, Commentary  The remedies the book outlines should be considered on college campuses, among parents of current and future students, and by anyone longing for a more sane society.   Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Something has been going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: What doesn t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures. Embracing these untruths and the resulting culture of safetyism interferes with young people s social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice. They situate the conflicts on campus within the context of America s rapidly rising political polarization and dysfunction. This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pbqkDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+American+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Der Rosenkavalier in Full Score (Dover Vocal Scores) (German Edition)","description":"First inexpensive edition of great operatic masterpiece, reprinted complete and unabridged from rare, limited Furstner edition (1910) approved by Strauss. \\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BpNlA7yMcUoC&dq=Der+Rosenkavalier+in+Full+Score+(Dover+Vocal+Scores)+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shock Talk The Exorcist Files","description":"The engaging smile and easy manner of Billy McBride, TV talk show host, belies the deep pain he carries from childhood-being abandoned by his father.

Heracles and Achilles displayed their valor in duels with Amazon queens, and the Athenians reveled in their victory over a powerful Amazon army. In historical times, Cyrus of Persia, Alexander the Great, and the Roman general Pompey tangled with Amazons. But just who were these bold barbarian archers on horseback who gloried in fighting, hunting, and sexual freedom? Were Amazons real? In this deeply researched, wide-ranging, and lavishly illustrated book, National Book Award finalist Adrienne Mayor presents the Amazons as they have never been seen before. This is the first comprehensive account of warrior women in myth and history across the ancient world, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Great Wall of China. Mayor tells how amazing new archaeological discoveries of battle-scarred female skeletons buried with their weapons prove that women warriors were not merely figments of the Greek imagination. Combining classical myth and art, nomad traditions, and scientific archaeology, she reveals intimate, surprising details and original insights about the lives and legends of the women known as Amazons. Provocatively arguing that a timeless search for a balance between the sexes explains the allure of the Amazons, Mayor reminds us that there were as many Amazon love stories as there were war stories. The Greeks were not the only people enchanted by Amazons Mayor shows that warlike women of nomadic cultures inspired exciting tales in ancient Egypt, Persia, India, Central Asia, and China. Driven by a detective's curiosity, Mayor unearths long-buried evidence and sifts fact from fiction to show how flesh-and-blood women of the Eurasian steppes were mythologized as Amazons, the equals of men. The result is likely to become a classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mW6YDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Tribe+of+Warrior+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Techniques of Astral Combat: An Analysis of the Astral Planes","description":"\\"The Techniques of Astral Combat\\" is a important book.

It is the deepest and most effective spiritual work I have found, and it has helped me realize my dreams. Each time I read it, I am amazed at the depth and breadth of wisdom and love it teaches. It is a practical way of truth that will change your life.  Barbara Ann Brennan, author of Hands of Light For more than twenty years, Eva Pierrakos was the channel for a spirit entity known only as the Guide. Combining rare psychological insight with an inspiring ision of human possibility, the Guide's teachings, known as the Pathwork, have influenced many key New Age thinkers who have studied at Pathwork centers in the United States and abroad. Now, the core teachings of the guide have been collected in one volume synthesizing the essential wisdom of the Pathwork. Under such headings as  The Idealized Self-Image,   The Forces of Love, Eros, and Sex,   Emotional Growth and Its Function,   Real and False Needs,  and  The Spiritual Meaning of Crisis,  the Pathwork outlines the entire process of personal spiritual development. Unlike many over-idealized philosophies, the Pathwork confronts our devils as well as our anges, our all-too-human failings and petty ego concerns as well as our divine strengths. It shows us how to accept ourselves fully as we are now, and then ot move beyond the negativity, or  lower self,  that blocks our personal and spiritual evolution. It offers a practical, rational, and honest way to reach our deepest creative identity.  I would advise that this book be read with a willingness to take time to digest what the Guide says. This is not  light  reading, thought it is Light reading, I assure you. I find an enormous compatibility between these lectures and Emmanuel's teachings. What a wonderful gift to a wonderful world.

A. Powell writes. \\"The price of that gift is memory.\\" Visually arresting, Tea is an experimental poem-cycle with traditional formal techniques built into its \\"wild\\" surface. The first section consists of portraits of young men, friends or former lovers, who have contracted or have died of AIDS. Pushing into the margins of culture as well as of the page, Powell combines all manner of subject and tone to create a work part memory play, part episodic novel, part funny pages -- even part dance. Poems sing from the mouths of actor Sal Mineo, Batman's sidekick Robin, and the little girl from The Exorcist. A fugue for a disco singer, a letter to the poet's dog, an ode to the 1980s and a confession of love to a public toilet vibrate between the comic and the tragic.

Forster,","description":"The five novels E.M.Forster published during his lifetime enjoyed a popularity and critical acclaim out of all proportion to this modest fictional output or the books' apparent pretensions: certainly since the publication of Howards End in 1910 he has been regarded almost without question as one of the foremost novelists of the century. Since his death in 1970 there has been no slackening of interest; the appearance of a comprehensive biography, an edition of his letters, a major critical edition of his works, and other scholarly and critical aids has given fresh impetus to the reassessment of his achievement. The present study provides a short account of Forster's life and career, followed by detailed discussion of his major writings. A final chapter considers his posthumous novel Maurice and the short stories. Although his most significant work belongs to the first quarter of the twentieth century, Forster's alliance of wit and seriousness, satiric comedy and moral insight, gives it a perennial freshness for new generations of students and readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gZBKEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Simpler the Better : Sensational Italian Meals","description":"125 quick-and-easy recipes for swift, sophisticated cooking Today s home cooks demand books that provide quick, convenient ways to serve tasty meals.

With her clue in hand she gains a commission from the newspaper leading the search for the  man in the brown suit,  and her investigation leads her to take passage on a South Africabound ocean liner. On board, she meets a famous socialite, a fake missionary, a possible secret service agent, and the M.P. at whose estate the second murder occurred.

A history of England)","description":" These fascinating and valuable studies supplement Sir Charles Oman s major works about the Napoleonic Wars  Wellington s Army and the majestic seven-volume History of the Peninsular War. The subjects of study range widely and interestingly. They include a discussion of the views of historians from the time of Herodotus to the nineteenth century, and an account of the Secret Service which, as the author says in his Preface, illustrates  the underworld of political and military intrigue which escapes notice in general histories . Here, too, are Oman s seminal reflections on  Column and Line in the Peninsula . Along with his study of the Battle of Maida, also included in the book, this was the result of his investigation of British tactics before the Peninsular War, upon which he based his comprehension of Wellington s method of warfare. The discussion of Napoleon s use of cavalry draws from the whole period of the campaigns of 1800 to 1815, arising from the author s endeavours to discover the principles according to which Napoleon s generals handled cavalry during the Spanish War. The reappearance of these absorbing studies by one of the great masters of British military history will be warmly welcomed by specialist historians and general readers alike. -Print ed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5K5vCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sing and Learn Chinese (Book & CD) Second Edition","description":"The words Tong Sing mean 'know everything book'.

Imaro is heroic fantasy like it s never been done before. Based on Africa, and African traditions and legends, Charles Saunders has created Nyumbani (which means  home  in Swahili), an amalgam of the real, the semi-real, and the unreal. Imaro is the name of the larger-than-life warrior, an outcast, who travels across Nyumbani, searching for a home. Like his contemporaries, Karl Edward Wagner (Kane) and Michael Moorcock (Elric), Charles Saunders brings something new to the traditional heroic fantasy tale. A broad knowledge of, and passion for, the history and myths of Africa led to the creation of a heroic fantasy character the likes of which the world has never seen. Imaro is no Tarzan  no Conan  Imaro is a warrior out of African legend. Saunders' novel fuses the narrative style of fantasy fiction with a pre-colonial, alternate Africa. Inspired by and directly addresses the alienation of growing up an African American fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy, which to this day remains a very ethnically homogonous genre. It addresses this both structurally (via its unique setting) and thematically (via its alienated, tribeless hero-protagonist). The tribal tensions and histories presented in this fantasy novel reflect actual African tribal histories and tensions, and provide a unique perspective to current and recent conflicts in Africa, particularly the Rwandan genocide and the ongoing conflict in The Sudan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iv0cvgAACAAJ&dq=Imaro&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Surrender","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rocannon's World / The Kar-Chee Reign","description":"Earth is flat, empty, weary, and bare.
