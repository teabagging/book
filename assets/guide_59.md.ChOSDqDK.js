It is a huge book! But some of the magic that made the others so interesting is missing from this one. And the sex scenes are too overdone; like poorly written romance novels."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"So I have read the Earth Children series a few times and I thought that this was a decent addition, but it has nothing on the first two books. I agree with the review that talk about how great it would be if Ayla and Jondalar had mediocre sex for once and if Ayla could become less of a godess. I kept waiting for the people in the book to proclaim Ayla The doni in person and build her a throne of gold. I did enjoy the Summer Meeting and seeing Ayla and Jondalar finally mate. A lot of people go on and on about how wonderful the historial descriptions are but personally I skip over them. I can't spend 20 pages reading about the color of a lake!!! All and all pretty good but not the best. I am looking foward to the 6th book and I hope we finally get to find out about what happens to Durc and the Clan."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Just not up to snuff compared with her previous books is what I found.I imagine it was hard for her to get back into the rhythm of writing after such a hiatus. While I enjoyed this 5th novel, I much preferred the first 4 as they seemed to flow one into the other."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am typically more understanding and sympathetic towards authors and new books; however, I must say that this book was a disappointment. I felt as if I was reading the same chapter over and over. I even checked once to make sure I was on the right page, but Auel was just describing the Mother's Song once again. There are many very interesting, well-written, and well-researched parts of the book, but it is mostly a review of the past books and LONG descriptions of the same thing. Everyone knows how to cut and paste paragraphs, including Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like most devoted readers of this series I was waiting for this one--Ayala finally meets Jondular's family and the people of the Zelandonnii. I expected more drama & more subplots, especially with Marona, Jondular's jilted lover whom he left to go on his journey, with his brother Thonalan.On his retun, only a few words of greeting between Jondular and Marona. A high school prank played on Ayala turns out ok and Marona is hardly mentioned again, except for her thoughts towards both Jondular and Ayala at the Summer meeting.Also, Ayala is warmly accepted by his family within 3 days of meeting her. Out of 200 people-Marona and Laramar are the only 2 who dislike her????? UnrealI also found it tedious repeating everything--yes I can appreciate recounting Ayala's early life with the clan, her relationship with wolf and the horses, her acceptance to the Lion Camp, however once the reader is told this initally is it neccessary to recount it every few chapters?The fourth book, \\"the Plains of passage', i felt was a most boring read due to the lack of people, dialogue and conflict. Even Jondualr being captured by the Amazon was quick, and onward back to their trek across prehistoric Europe.This 5th one, should have had some strife--espaecially with Jondular's family being leaders of the Zelandonii, shouldn't have readily accepted Ayala after only knowing of her for 3 days, mainly based their recounting their journey, Ayala telling of her upbringing, making fire with firestones and sewing with the threadpuller. Though they are shown all of this and find their stories amazing, interesting, 'hard-to-imagine,\\" I felt as leaders of this people, they should have kept their ready acceptance of Ayala contained for the family only-- They are aware of the prejudice towards the Flatheads. Even when being told of Ayala's upbringing with the clan, as leaders of this people, they should have given everyone in the ninth cave a chance to know Ayala without the use of theirinfluence of status.I felt, like with the Clan and the Lion Camp, everyone would have the opportunity to voice their opinions when it became time. Then everyone, including Jondular's family in their position of leadership,could vote for Ayala to be accepted as a member of the Zelandonii or if any objections,then Ayala could show whatever skill, be it with fire, her soothing tea, her sling to them, for approval. If not, she would be at the Summer Meeting after she is mated to Jondular.Because the story has Jondular's family and the Zelandonni people accepting of Ayala so readily and easily, I felt a new reader may also feel rushed into acceptance of Ayala-- Everything she does is wonderful! Ayala is right! Ayala is so skilled! The reader was innundated with the author's passion for the heroine without any sense of objectivity."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I didn't mind the repetition, it's years since I read the previous books. But from what I remember of those books, this was hugely disappointing.While on the positive side it was a substantial read, and doubtless as well researched as the previous novels, there were several irritants. Endless herbal tea. The ludicrous idea of a cro-magnon hippy craft cooperative. Jondalar's Elvis-in-Vegas white leather wedding suit (even Barbie's Ken would have baulked at that). It was also disappointing that we did not get news of Durc, though perhaps that will be in a future novel.Above all, given Ayla's wonderwoman-progress in earlier chapters, I was astonished that she had not invented electric lightbulbs, the internal combustion engine, and nuclear fission by the final page."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Oh, Ayla, Ayla! Wherefore art thou Ayla...?In the first book we rooted for her. The young girl, without a family, who thinks differently, rebels, but most of all survives. We believed in her world...it was harsh and demanding. It was easy to suspend your disbelief. We believed in her. In the second book, still surviving, she found love and the ugly duckling turned into a swan. We were pleased to see that. After all she's been through, the girl deserved some happiness. In the third book, we wanted her accepted by her own (at least in between all the sex sessions). By the fourth book, Ayla was starting to get predictable and annoying. And then we waited.Time passed, some of us finished high school, college, got a job, got married...from time to time hoping that we'll get to visit Ayla's world again. And finally there she was,perfect to the point of nusea, singing the longest and most annoying song. Every time Ayla looked at something, she turned into a heroine like no other. Her society, more politically correct than ours, never suffers. None of the caves fight with each other, in fact I don't think these people knew what war was. The herbal remedies that are more efficient than anything you can find in 21st century. And boy, does the traveler get treated better among the Zelandoni than today. (No one will ever steal from you in Ayla's world that's for sure.)Honestly, sometimes I felt like I was watching a child's play made up with Barbie dolls: \\"Let's play house...this will be the home...people will eat here...oh, I know, let's have a little cup there so if someone wants a drink, they can use it!\\" The dialogue certainly didn't help.Having said all that...and more, which was mentioned by other readers already (unlike the book, I will not be repetitious) I am waiting for the sixth part. Like a fool, I hope Ayla will become human again. And now, I think I will have a cup of tea, look to the right and notice cure for cancer sitting right in front of me."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"There were originally supposed to be five books in the series; this is maybe half a book's worth of content expanded and fluffed out to serve as setup for the final book in the series. I will not be reading the final book because I'm too disappointed in this one.Ms. Auel is a fine writer and she does good research. Yet this book lacks the character development and structure that characterized her earlier work. It comes across as having been written on an ad hoc basis here and there. Unlike a Tolkien tale that \\"grew in the telling\\", this just kind of rambles. Auel's using a loose episodic structure instead of the plot-driven and character-driven style from \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\". It isn't working. The repetition is getting old. A good editor would not have allowed this much repetition, particularly of that mediocre poem. Editing would have condensed the \\"story\\" and plot into about a hundred, maybe a hundred and fifty pages of potentially good reading. But that wouldn't have allowed for a sixth book.The character development in this book is particularly sloppy. Auel was starting to lose it as early as \\"The Plains of Passage\\" because of the repetitive nature of what had to happen: Ayla and Jondalar meet people, people meet horses and Wolf, people freak out, etc., etc. By now she's in the very familiar series-writer problem: how does she bring a new reader into the story without reiterating what people who have been following the series already know? She's accordingly cut corners in the development not only of her main characters, but in the development of new characters. Even the love scenes are repetitive and lack variety. Large amounts of terrain and anthropological information is repeated from previous books.Earlier in the series, even the antagonists were not presented in a uniformly negative way. Broud, Frebec, Attaroa, and other antagonists were presented as products of their environments. None were completely evil. Each had some redeeming qualities. Each one had a plausible reason for hating Ayla, and the resolution wasn't always complete. Ayla definitely didn't always win and the conclusion was not always foregone. But after \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\" where Ayla did successfully bring a community around to support her, detractors and all, every other community she and Jondalar encountered has followed more or less the same shock/revulsion/acceptance pattern. What started in \\"Plains\\" has continued in \\"Shelters\\". The characters have become very black and white in a way that worked in \\"Plains\\" because Ayla and Jondalar were just passing through. It doesn't work in the community they've made their home. These newer characters either adore and nearly worship Ayla, or they are severely defective and their objections to her are based solely on their own inadequacy and bigotry. When Frebec and Broud disliked Ayla, their dislike had a reasonable basis in fact. In \\"Shelters\\", the only people who dislike Ayla are those who are completely immature or who are threatened by her superiority.Meanwhile, Ayla and Jondalar have stopped making mistakes and being human. In \\"Clan\\", Ayla was impulsive and sometimes immature. As recently as \\"Mammoth\\" she made a serious error in judgement and got engaged to the wrong guy. But somewhere during \\"Plains\\", she gradually morphed into this omniscient, infallible person. There's nowhere to take this character. She's been overbuilt. The only way she comes into conflict with other characters or with societal rules is if those characters and rules themselves are wrong. But, unlike in \\"Clan\\", where the rules triumphed over Ayla, in \\"Shelters\\" when the rules are wrong, it's the rules and the society themselves that have to change instead of Ayla. Suspension of disbelief aside, it's impossible to keep this Mary Jane state of affairs and still build plot tension.Now, if Ayla made a medical mistake and someone got badly hurt as a result, or if she had a fight with Jondalar, or lost her temper, or went on an ego trip and told off Zolena or somebody powerful for no good reason, it might be different. Similarly, if Wolf developed rabies, if one of the horses broke a leg, or if Baby showed up and started eating people, that would provoke some legitimate conflict. As it is, Ayla's become a force of nature. Forces of nature are... not... interesting... to read about.Jondalar's character has mostly flattened out. His development was best in \\"The Valley of Horses\\". As recently as \\"Mammoth\\" he was inventing stuff and generally acting like an individual and not just a foil for Ayla. He started his decline in \\"Plains\\" and is now simply an object to be fought over by women.Essentially, this is half a book, and less than half a character if you add up everybody."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I seriously think there's just not a whole lot more Auel can do with Ayla. I'd personally rather read about what happens to Durc.Ok, Ayla goes back with Jondalar and they get married and have a kid and everyone loves Ayla and ...yeah. We get the point. Happily ever after doesn't make for a good 500 page novel, and the few small conflicts in the story aren't enough to keep me interested. I was a heck of a lot more interested in the crazy half-clan guy than Ayla and Jondalar having sex again. Should have done more character development with him.As is, I'll finish the series because the first 3 books especially were great. The last 2 (and especially this one) not so hot. Oh well, even writers get burnt out I guess, and there was probably that pressure to pump out another Ayla book, inspired or not."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I used to be a huge fan of Ayla to the point that I even read the first three books more than once. The fourth book however didn't attract me as much until I had read 200 pages. I find Auel's latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book. The rest of the reviewers explain perfectly how this book has nothing offer so I won't repeat their comments.I wouldn't recommend this book to any friend."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ms Auel's books, though they have potential, have become progressively less substantial in plot and character just as they have become more loaded with Paleolithic description. The first book covers 12 years of the main character's life, the second 3 years, and the third and fourth a year each. This book covers in depth far less than nine months, and it shows. Nothing happens. Tensions are introduced, but not developed. Interesting characters in difficult situations are ignored. There was potential in this story, but it is not brought out. What this feels like is the first few chapters to a potentially exciting novel (provided that the small amount of tension and plot hinted at were developed well), but instead has been bulked out by pages and pages of description and honorifics. Of course, it would also have helped if the main characters were not so inhumanly pleasant and actually disagreed occasionally like normal families.In The Clan of the Cave Bear, Ms Auel wrote a beautiful and fascinating story, one in which complex characters clashed with each other, even when they loved each other. But unless she decides to develop more of the plot and less of the botany, I'm afraid that book will stand alone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I really tried to enjoy this book. I am such a fan of her previous works and have re-read them several times. This book was TERRIBLE. I was so disappointed. I skipped half the book because I chose not to read all the re-hashing, and there are WAY too many sex scenes. Not sure I'll even bother with the next one. Hope she gets it together, and gets back in touch."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"We listened to the unabridged audio of this sinker. If you think reading those love scenes were laughable trying hearing them. Also, the poem and formal greetings were unfreakinbelievable! I am amazed that anyone would rate this book anything but B and that's B for BORING and BAD NEWS."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... Snort! Oh, excuse me, I must have fallen asleep over my copy of Shelters of Stone again.I felt almost obligated to read this book in spite of the bad press it's received because I read each of the four previous novels in this series. I didn't like Plains of Passage very much, but had high hopes that Shelters of Stone would recapture something of the feel of the first three books. Alas, Auel has presented us with a tedious doorstop of a book that in the end left me wondering why I bothered to work my way through the whole thing. The plot goes nowhere, there is little character development, and there is so much repetition of material that I found myself skimming pages more and more frequently as I progressed through the book. The whole thing is so badly edited and the conclusion is so abrupt that I was left with the impression that Auel walked away from her computer to get a cup of coffee and while she was gone someone transmitted the unpolished novel to the publisher without her knowledge.And the Mother's Song... Oh, the Mother's Song. What can I say that other reviewers haven't already said? It's one of the most outstanding terrible poems I've ever read, rivaling some of the stuff in \\"Very Bad Poetry\\" (edited by Ross and Kathryn Petras). Never mind the fact that it's repeated several times. One reading was more than enough to convince me that this is one of the worst poems ever written in the English language. It should be awarded prizes based on its sheer awfulness and the way it makes your hair stand on end when you read it.To be fair, I have to say that Shelters of Stone isn't ALL bad. I enjoy books that focus on social history, fiction or otherwise, so the descriptive passages about housing, hunting, and ritual that annoyed so many other reviewers were often interesting to me.In addition, I was delighted to discover that Ayla and/or Jondalar didn't invent the wheel, at least not yet. I've almost been expecting this to happen and was happy to be disappointed in this respect. I suppose there's not much time for inventing in a society where you spend two-thirds of your waking hours naming your ties to everyone you meet.In short, there is very little new information in this book. Auel takes 700+ pages to tell us that Ayla and Jondalar are mated, that their daughter is born, and that Ayla has decided to become One Who Serves. Sorry, Amazon.com, but I can't recommend that people purchase this one. If you're devoted to the series and feel that you must read it, check it out at your friendly neighborhood library and save yourself the purchase price."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Okay, there's very little I can add here. Please believe everyone who hated this book. What did they, glue all the previous books together? Really, the original content could maybe fill a page. The thing is, aside from the repetition and ridiculous amount of boring dialog, is that there just isn't a story here. I didn't think much of The Plains of Passage, but it least it had the man-hating tyrant and Ayla's rescue of Jondalar. There is nothing exciting in the book. Ayla's enemies sort of fade off into nothing. Like maybe something will happen in the 6th book, but really it won't be worth the paper it's printed on.Buy it (in paperback) and read it because you love Ayla (though she is less humble in this one). Just don't expect to see her do anything new. And for pete's sake, don't read the other four books for about 12 years before you pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This most recent offering in the Earth's Children Series is a decent read if you are looking for a book written by an average author. If you are looking for the brilliance and creativity you found in the first four books you will be disappointed. Reading this book leaves you wondering why you had to wait so many years. It ties up what happens to Ayla and Jondalar and would have made a nice ending to the fourth book but it just is not able to stand on its own. There is a strong feeling that Jean Auel was tired and having made a nice short story suitable for lunch hour reading she reworked it using repetitive wording and other filler suitable for a high school science report to stretch the story in an effort to make it a book. There is just no meat to the story, no strong conflict, no heart wrenching decisions, just nothing to make you care about the characters. Fans will be disappointed in this story but at least it gives a feeling of closure, unlike the first four books this one does not leave you hungry and desperate for more. Like oatmeal when you want steak...it will fill the void but never satisfy the craving for red meat. The best I can say is that after reading this I feel indifferent when I think about the possibility of a sixth book. The addiction has been cured. Buy it and let the memories of past triumph temper your criticism for a brilliant author who has lost her way."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited faithfully for 11 years for the next book from Ms. Auel. I have to say I am a bit disappointed. You can eliminate at least 300 pages of the the 700+ page book and not miss anything. Ms. Auel should have had more faith in her readers that they didn't need to be reminded frequently of things that happened in the previous books. There are times when it feels as if she is just adding stuff in the fill the pages. Like I said I would have been missing 300 pages of back ground fill in and other repetative narratives. Ok how many times did we need to be told that the Zelandoni \\"The First\\" was overweight and needed a big stool to sit? How many times did I need to hear how Ayla liked to wash in the cold stream like she was taught by Iza after pleasures and even though Jondalar didn't really enjoy this custom as long as she did he could try to like it? It is things like this repeated endlessly through this book that makes it slow moving. I skipped through quite a few of the long passages simply because they were already told a chapter or two ago. The greeting process was another thing that we had to wade through. Also how many times did we have to listen (read) to the First sing the Earth Mothers Song? I hope that Ms. Auel gives her readers more credit in her next book. We are fans we know the story we don't need to read and reread it again."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"In \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" we were introduced to Ayla and her foster family.In \\"Valley of Horses\\", Ayla sets out to find her own people and eventually meets and falls in love with one of them (Jondalar).In \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\", she comes to live with a larger group of her people for the first time.In \\"Plains of Passage\\", she accompanies Jondalar on his long journey home to his tribe.SPOILERSAfter they have finally made it to \\"The Shelters of Stone\\", the story comes to a screeching halt. Nothing even remotely interesting happens in this book. Ayla and Jon get married and finally have their baby. That's it.While the first four volumes in the series admittedly had their lengthy passages, they kept me interested enough to only skip a few pages here and there. But \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" was so boring that I skip-read 99% of it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Because a bookstore I frequent was having a \\"buy three get one free\\" sale, I picked up \\"Shelters of Stone\\" for nothing-- and still feel cheated. I waited twelve years for this book and am embarassed to have been seen walking out of the store with it. As such, SoS is currently proping up a short table leg.Jean Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series has simply declined in quality since the publication of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" \\"Shelters of Stone\\" is the penultimate book of the series and by far the least interesting and most repetitive of the bunch. There is no balance between plot/action and the excessive descriptions of flora and fauna; the characters are predictable and the dialogue insipid.Everything a reader needs to know about what happens to the characters can be read in the Amazon.com reviews. Instead of wasting my time and money with the final book, I'll be reading here to find out what happens."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like other fans, I have waited for this book for so long. It was a bitter disappointment. There is no storyline, the characters are shallow, and the dialogue long and boring. It could stand alone as a non-fiction book on the flora, fauna, geographical oddities, and craftmanship of the time period. I understand there is a need for background and environment, but there is also a need for character and story. Scenarios and characters promising conflict were introduced, then dropped by the wayside. The Clan is an integral part of this continuing story, but they are strangely missing. What happened?The other books in this series transported us to another place and time, giving us memories almost as real as if we were really there. They stuck in the mind long after the reading was over. This book doesn't deserve to carry the name - it should never have left the editor's desk."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"You do not need to have read the previous books to be bored by this one. The SoS is all four books combined plus 4 days of intense details as Ayla meet the uptight Zelandonii followed by a quick skip to the Summer Meeting and then a leap to the birth with a step to the birth of Whinney's foal.The rest of the book is filled with Ms Auel's last 10 years of research of the cave system in France. In the acknowledgments at the beginning of the book she says thank you to Dr Rigaud because he proof read everything she had written about the area which was presented first and then it sounds like she filled in the rest of her Geological and Anthropological thesis with a couple of cardboard characters to take up another 100 pages. If she isn't already, then I am sure that some august body in a museam or university will bestow a fellowship on my once favourite author for her work in this field.I am deeply disappointed in this \\"story\\" and think that Ayla should hightail it back to the Mamutoi as fast as Whinney can carry her. At least there she had a life worth getting up in the morning for. The brief encounter we had with the Ramudoi in The Plains of Passage was more exciting than over 700 pages with the Zelandonii. Come back Ranec, all is forgiven! Now we know why Jondalar has always been so painful. Growing up with people so set in their ways they make The Clan look advanced must have been a handicap for him.I highly recommend this book if you are studying anthropology or geology or anything to do with the Ice Age and the Dawn of Man. (Hey that would have been a better title for this book) You will not be sidetracked by a plot as there isn't one. Please Ms Auel, less research and more character please!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been a huge fan of the Earth's Children series since I first read Clan of the Cave Bear. I thought that Plains of Passage was a little too detailed at time about the flora and funa that the characters were traveling through but overall it was a great story. I'd be happy if Shelters of Stone were in line with that. I just could not get into the story, if in fact there was one. Seriously, the first 300 pages are pretty much nothing but introductions to one-line characters that do nothing for the plot. Pretty much \\"this is so and so from this cave\\". Then they're never mentioned again. There's a couple of minor conflicts such as when Ayla meets the woman that Jondular was promised to before he left but the conflicts are easily solved. I was also expecting a lot more from the search for Jondular's brother in the spirit world. It was mentioned so many times in the previous novels that I was really looking forward to it. Again, the actual scene fell flat. The characters drink the special tea, go into the spirit world, find the brother, and send him on his way. No muss, no fuss, no bother. The whole part only took a couple of pages. There was more description of the cave that they were in than the event itself. Plus the event is told from Ayla's point of view but only Jondular sees his brother (if he does, they never really discuss it at the time) so she only gets impressions of what's happening. What kind of story-telling device is that? Overall I think that Ms. Auel did a great job researching to give the story local flavor but the plot left me feeling empty."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"About once every chapter, it seems. Honestly.When I read Shelters of Stone the first time, I really thought that it had to have been written by a ghostwriter. Only the fact that I checked the book out of the library kept me from redlineing the entire thing and sending it back to Ms. Auel's agent with suggestions on how to make it better. (I only own a copy I got second hand because I have minor OCD when it comes to having complete sets of things.)Upon re-read, my intial impression stands. Every SINGLE time Ayla mets someone new, we are treated to the entire Litany of Awesome \\"Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth, Friend to Horses and Wolves and also COOLER THAN YOU WILL EVER BE.\\" We are also treated to the reaction of the new person, which goes something like \\"He first noticed that she talked kind of funny- not an accent really, but there were some sounds she could not quite make. But then he noticed how GODDAMN BEAUTIFUL she was, so the talking thing no longer mattered.\\" EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. OH MY GOD, WE GET IT.The dialogue (never Auel's strong point) was clunky at best, and excreteble at worst. The \\"action\\" was kind of pathetic and boring (at least Plains of Passage had a point). Constantly restating the ENTIRE Song of the Mother at least three times was unneccesary. Yeah, we know it. Restating the entire plots of the first four books (I know it's been 12 years, but people can and do reread, you know) was boring.If the only way to continue the series is through a ghostwriter, it's better to let the series just die, honestly."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"WOW, over 700 pages of tea drinking, 5 minute formal introductions for every personal encounter, 21st century medicine and anatomy lessons, social welfare reform, and Giorgio fashion statements.

I loved the parts that told the spirits to \\"go to the light\\" or they \\"tied the knot\\" and were mated. All of this knowledge of humanity, medicine, art, and civilization and they still can't figure our how babies are made. Go figure!I only finished this book because I waited 12 years for the continued saga. What a waste of time. I skimmed over pages of pure bunk including ceremonial songs and chants.

I am extremely sorry to say that the book was not worth the wait.Unlike the other books in the series which had interesting plots,well developed characters, and all sorts of conflicts that we could relate to, this book really had no plot. We all knew from the beginning that Ayla was going to marry Jondalar and have a baby and that's exactly how things went. There were no surprises, no serious conflicts waiting to be resolved. Ayla just meets tons and tons of Zelandoni people who are surprised about everything she does. Unfortunately, most of these characters are introduced but not developed or further integrated into the story.Then there's the problem of repetition. There was so much repetition in this story, that I don't think anyone who hasn't read the previous books in the series is going to feel the need to do so.Even though I was disappointed in the book, I am still an Auel fan and have begun the wait for the next book.

I was up all night. But I had to keep myself awake with this one. The enwrapping descriptions was still there, just like the other two, but it didn't grab me the way the first two did. Perhaps \\"Shelters of Stone\\" didn't offer anything new."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is an update to review the AUDIO BOOK version of Shelters of Stone.I have enjoyed Sandra Burr's reading of the entire series. However, on this the 5th book, she has significantly altered the voice of Ayla. She reads Alya with a very strong accent. Though Ayla has always been described as having a \\"exotic\\" pronunciation due to her life with the Clan, this is the first time Burr has attempted to create it. Personally, I do not like it, especially because the most significant feature of her voice was supposed to be the way she and Clan \\"swallow\\" certain sounds. Here, Burr emphasizes a trilled or rolled R sound, with a narrow, vaguely Russian accent.I miss the old Ayla. This person is a stranger, as the character herself might say.Just be warned before buying! If I had known, I might not have started it.But beyond that, Burr's performance actually helps one of the major flaws in Auel's writing - the constant, almost word for word repetition. As many reviewers have commented, Auel repeats paragraphs and even full passages throughout the book, making it very difficult to read. Though this is still incredibly frustrating, Burr does her best to alter the reading of the repeated passages, sometimes with different character voices and sometimes with emotional variation. Unfortunately, some of the repetition, like the paragraph that follows EVERY time Ayla jumps on her horse: \\"she killed the horse's mother, she raised the horse, she didn't mean to ride her, the horse goes where she wants because they are friends,\\" are repeated too often for Burr to vary.****The series started as an interesting imagining of the past, compelling in its own way. The 2nd book, Valley of the Horses, picked up where Clan of the Cave Bear left off, but with each successive book the faults of the others multiplies. I was looking forward to the latest in the series, but found it to be part laborious archaeological list and part erotica.Auel also doesn't trust her readers to remember plot from book to book or chapter to chapter and repeats far too much. When not giving us the same tedious description of how to use a \\"spear thrower,\\" the ingredients in pregnancy tea, or how to tan leather, she inserts yet another sex scene that is indistinct from the first.If, like me, you have to finish a series, be content skimming through the rehash. There's always hope the final book will move into new territory."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"In a nutshell - this book desperately needed more diligent editing. The landscape descriptions went on and on and on, over and over and over again. The recollections of Ayla's background were also repeated too frequently. How about just saying, \\"they gathered around the fire and shared her story\\" nuf said!Should you read it? Sure - if you have read the other books.Will you find yourself skimming a lot? You betcha.Am I going to read the next in the series? Sure, but probably not before it hits the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"While this book lacked the excitement and intrique of the others in the series, it was none-the-less, a welcomed return to the story of Ayla's life. While it was interesting to learn about Jondalar's culture and Ayla's integration into it, I have to say I expected more challenges. There seemed to be the potential for interesting conflicts between the characters, unfortunately they were never really played out. A couple other slightly annoying points... Auel revisited past events (from eariler books) too often and in too much detail. Also, the love scenes were a bit pointless and repetative... not ripe with passion (e.g. The Mammoth Hunters). But hey, aside from my small gripes, I couldn't it put it down! It was nice revisiting the characters I have missed so much over the past few years..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As with many others I was anxiously awaiting the release of the new book. For years I had been hearing rumors that Auel had cancer and died, or other crazyness that another book was not being released. Now that I have read the book, and again re-read the series and Shelter's of Stone, I am begining to find the wordiness and repetitivenous tedious. I started to feel that she was cutting and pasting paragraphs from one book to the other. This final book was an OK read, but not the page turner that the other books were. I sincerly hope the next book is a step up."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I first read Valley of the Horses when I was 11. Then I discovered it was a sequel, and found Clan of the Cave Bear a couple of years later. From that moment on, I was a dedicated adorer of the Earth's Children series. Yes, I admit the Mammoth Hunters was more in the style of Barbara Cartland... and I was sad about that, but the rest of that book was so good, the whole jealousy story faded into the background.Jean Auel redeemed herself in Plains of Passage and with glee, I devoured it. Ten years later, after uncounted queries at booksellers as to when the new book was going to be released, Shelters of Stone appeared on the shelves. You can imagine my joy. I purchased the hardback, and sat down after making many special preparations as if it would be a religious experience...I have never been so disappointed in a book in my life. Shelters of Stone was slow, dry, and provided me no incentive or motivation to keep me reading on except for a vain hope of it getting better (and perhaps my undying loyalty to one of my all time favourite authors). I am so sad to say it! But when the last page was turned, and the trudging storyline came abruptly to an end, I was left feeling like I worked very, very hard for nothing. I could pick up the next book in the series (yet to be released) without ever having read Shelters of Stone, and would have missed nothing. I am sorry to say it, but I feel as if after ten years of chomping at the bit for the next installment of my favourite series of books, I was sorely let down by a story that felt as if it must been a struggle for the author to write. I love you Jean, but I'm sorry... this book was not at all to your standard. I hope the next one will be better... I'm counting on it, and I'll be first in line to buy it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"One star is half a star too many. We waited over ten years for this book and paid full price for the hardcover as soon as it came out. What is up with that looong boring song being printed over and over in it? The book could have been half as long without that. And as far as the story, the previous books hint that Ayla's child is going to be a boy and that there will be some sort of confrontation between her two sons. No chance of that happening judging by the ending..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"the only thing i have to say about this book is it [was bad]. what happened to the story. i was completly lost by the end of this book. i had read all the other book and enjoyed them but this one i just [disliked]..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I eagerly awaited this book and- flop. It's so old! It's really the plotline from \\"Plains of Passage\\" and \\"Mammoth Hunters\\" redone with new characters. Ayla meets lots of people, people are afraid of her inventions and animals, people begin to understand, one person refuses to be friendly with Ayla. Yeah, we know. And the whole thing with her hallucinations being \\"special\\". If Ayla was a modern woman she would be in constant therapy because of those. EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!And Jondalar. The sex scenes are so...graphic. And he's such a sexaholic! Thonolan seemed so much more in-depth as a character. Jondalar is a pretty boy, the end. It would have worked out as more interesting if Ayla were only average looking like a mortal, for god's sake. I hate Jondalar now. He's horrible. And, I'm sorry, do we need to know of his \\"eager member\\" or whatever she calls it?Ugh.I'm utterly disappointed."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"There is but one word to describe this 5th volume of Auel's Earth's Children series: boooring! What a disappointment! Potential readers should buy instead a decent cultural anthropology text. It would be no less tedious to read and might even yield some valid information."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Dreary book that advances the story very little. The settlement Ayla ends up in reminds me very much of some sort of prehistoric country club where mate-swapping looms on the horizon and everybody drinks alcoholic barma during dawn-of-man cocktail hour. The story of the taming of Wolf and Whinney is told repeatedly and the recitation of the \\"Mothers Song\\" seems to appear every few pages and makes one yearn for a male deity to show up. Save your money and get it from the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If you are a fan of the past 4 volumes, please wait and read the paperback...then you may skip the majority of the book as none of the characters are developed, it is a total rehash of the past four books, and it lacks Jean Auel normal details....it reads more like a Danielle Steele novel than the Earth Children Series I have loved for almost 20 years. There was not nearly enough character development nor excitement...my own imagination has been better than this total waste of time. I adore these books but this was not worth waiting 12 years for...it either needed to be longer or have some characters cut or something! Huge disappointment! Will not be nearly as excited about the next one even though it is the final one..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"First... Jean Auel has done her homework. I'll bet there is not a question about the geography, geology, zoology, botany, meteorology, etc of that particular time period of her chosen area that she could not answer spot-on. Her love, passion and fascination for this subject is very evident through the entire book.This however led to some confusion... was I reading a doctoral dissertation or a novel about a Cro-magnon woman and the tribe she marries into? I mean... plot? dialogue? action?They all tend to get lost, diminished or subsumed into the admittedly rich background.One of the other reviewers touched another sore spot... LOTS of repetition. This might be good for first-time readers, but I would think that most people reading this book have read the previous four novels, are familiar with the background, and really don't want to hear Jondalar tell the 'How Ayla saved me from the Cave Lion' story over dinner again.This book could have been at least 1/3 shorter without losing important information, and would have been a much more enjoyable read. I came away feeling as though I had been slogging through mud... and I am very very grateful for the existance of public libraries, for I would have been VERY disappointed if I had spent real money on this edition.Still... I hope the next one is better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Remembering way back when this series started with The Clan of the Cave Bear, how well and entertaining that and the following books were....till many years later when this book came out, and then the entertainment just stopped and it became a boring read, I lost all interest in the characters.I truly did try to read it through, but I just couldn't do it. I had to stop half-way through. Maybe it was just too long between books, or maybe I've just outgrown the writing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It was a good read but a lot slower to get into than her previous books. Things only seem to really have happened in about the last chapter or two. Jean M. Auel seems to have been more interested in detail about the land andd living conditions which i hate to admit made me skip pages at a time just to get to the characters doing anything. She seems to have written it as if she was writing to a brand new audience as she kept on going on and on about what ayla did and why and how she had discovered stuff and why and if, like me, you have read the previous books a couple of times it can be fairly tedious. But all that said, if you are a fan, lets face it - it was worth fighting through the book to find out about the baby and jondalars family (but what a fight!)."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the book with pleasure! After all, this is JEAN AUEL's Earth's Children Series the way she wants to tell it. I like the anthropological approach Auel uses to educate her readers. I liked it in the first book of the series, and I like it still. With the great amount of preparatory research Auel does she clearly is interested in the historical aspects of her story. And so are many of her readers. [The 'drivel' reviewer I'm sure wouldn't understand that. After all, her comment,\\"The *best* thing about the former books was the intensely erotic love scenes\\" suggests her lack of intellectual depth. There are plenty of steamy novels you should go to, and, please, do not buy or read Book 6 so you won't darken these reviews again.]I was glad to reacquaint with Ayla and Jondalar. I didn't need the reminders as much, but clearly, *because* of so many years since the last novel, Auel thought she needed to acquaint new readers, or forgetful ones, with Ayla's story. That's fine with me. I suggest a few negative reader's stop the whining. This is Auel's story which we have enjoyed over the years, and have even learned something about the history of man, early Europe, and the fauna and flora of a marvelous period in history in a charming way. Thanks Jean Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Nothing happens. That's pretty much my review. I waited 30 years to finish this series and discover how Ayla changes the world. I'll just say it is something she claimed from book one so there was no big epithany.In this book, instead of skipping long pages of descriptions of herbs and their uses, I skipped over long pages of descriptions of the paths that they followed on their journey and the pictures in the one too many caves they visited.I was disappointed that there were several plot lines left unfinished: What happened to Ayla's son? I expected them to meet again since there were other Clan characters in the last books. Did her daughter carry Ayla's wisdom and bring even more learning to mankind?It pains me to write this review but my advise is to skip this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I love this series and used to own the hard copy books. I heard the 6th book is coming out in March 2011 so I bought the first 5 books on Kindle so I could re-read them and be ready for the new release. This book, 5th in the series, has so many errors that it distracts from the story. Names spelled wrong, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and sometimes even a sentence or two that make no sense. Luckily since I have read the book in hard copy form I could figure out what it should have said, but it is very, very disappointing to pay money for a book that has so many errors. I can only hope this version is fixed and those of us who bought it get a free upgrade to a corrected book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I purchased the kindle edition of this book a few days ago and have been disappointed to find it full of typos, misspellings and wrong words that frequently change the meaning of a sentence so that I have to read it several times figuring out what the error is. This edition even has the name of Ayla's son Durc wrong, printing it as \\"Dure.\\" This is not the quality I have come to expect from the kindle editions of books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The main flaw in this book (and the last couple of them as well) is the repetition. Ms. Auel is a good author who can illustrate a scene vividly, but her downfall is that she repeats herself so much.I kept reading about how amazed people were at Ayla and Wolf and the horses. It happened like ten times. Enough is enough. Yeah, we get the idea. There's also how often people think Ayla is so hot or smart or amazing or whatever. Even Marona, despite her hatred for Ayla, is jealous because Ayla is so awesome.My problem is not that Ayla was able to do so many things. She had to figure out how to survive with the Clan and I liked that she was able to save Durc, that she was able to hunt and do other cool things. The second book was good. But the third and fourth books have a lot of repetition - people think Ayla and the animals are amazing, that she is so hot and gorgeous and brilliant, blah blah. Shelters of Stone was different in that it was centered in a community, much like Clan of the Cave bear, which is good because books 2-4 have Ayla living by herself or with Jondalar, just the two of them for the most part except their occasional encounter with other tribes. The Mammoth Hunters had some of its story set in a community, so it was good. After reading Plains of Passage, I was so ready to start this, and this book does have a lot of good parts.The sex is also repetitive, as well as Jondalar and Ayla's thoughts about one another - she loves him so much, he loves her so much he can't imagine life without her, and so on and so forth. Honestly, it got old, I preferred reading about their interactions with other people (when the people weren't being so freaking amazed by Wolf) One thing I would have liked to see is Ayla throwing a temper tantrum. In many cases, having a cool head is good, but once in a while I'd like to see her actually get pissed off and scream at someone. She never confronts Tremeda, Marona, Brukeval, Laramar, or any of the others who act spiteful or mean towards her. She's all sweetness, and that got boring. It'd have been cool to see her get into a fistfight or whatever.It'd also be nice to have someone NOT be attracted to Ayla. Men and women alike think she's gorgeous and everything, and her beauty is talked about quite a few times. Bleh! It'd be nice for someone to think, sure she's pretty, but she's just not my type'.I'd have also wanted to see a gay or lesbian character, for the sake of variety. I don't mean just a MENTION of them, as has happened a couple of times in the series. I want a gay character as part of Jondalar's cave and flirting with either Jondalar or Ayla, depending on the character's gender. It certainly would add a new dimension to Jondalar and Ayla's relationship!I heard that Ms. Auel had one more book planned after this, THEN two, but now it's back to one, to come out next year. Having just finished Shelters of Stone last week, I'm glad I don't have to wait as long as some of the others here did, and hope that there's not as much repetition and Ms. Auel actually tries something new. If she focuses on not being repetitive, Book 6 could be a true masterpiece and a wonderful way to end a creative series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Blah.I don't really know what to say.As someone who has a degree in anthropology, I actually love the detail that has always been heavily present in these books. I *like* the \\"boring\\" bits. But this was far, far worse than I could ever imagine. Repetition. No, none, zero conflict. Cardboard characters. No plot. The last 40-odd pages sounded more like the Auel we all know and love, but those cannot possibly justify the 700 pages of junk. The only element in that huge section that got me truly excited was Ayla's (inevitable) discovery of the cave that we know today as Lascaux.I was 14 when I finished the series that gave me an inkling about what I wanted to study in college...I'm now 25. And I'm horribly disappointed and heartsick. Jean Auel, what were you thinking??"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I could not wait for the new book! I was at the store when they opened on April 30 so I could get it right away after all the years I have been waiting.I really did think the next page would get better, but I suddenly realized the book was 3/4 over and I was just getting to the good stuff, if you could call it that.I have learned to skim pages very quickly when Jean Auel is going over, for the 4th time, the landscape etc... of their surroundings. Where is the tension, suspense, confrontation and all the other wonderful attributes of the other novels?SOS only seems to flaunt the wonderful things Ayla does. She can do no wrong, and she is just too perfect in this one. BORING! I think Jondalar has lost alot of his sexiness in this one. He seems to be like a lost puppy dog following Ayla around all the time. This is not the way I feel his character should be. He is a very sensitive and strong man. Where did he go? I think Jean Auel should release the 6th book very soon if it is better than this one. She owes her readers who have waited so long for SOS and were so very disappointed. I think after all this time, we deserve a true Earth Children novel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting so long for the next installment it is sad that this is the best we get. I am so disappointed. I kept reading the book waiting for something, anything, to happen. The story never got off the ground, the charactors were flat and at no time inspired my imagination as the previous books had done."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like everyone I have anxiously waited for 10 years for this book. When I learned it would be released in April I went to the library and began to reread the past 4 books so I would be up to speed.This book just didn't live up to the expectations and quality of the other books. We kept getting a \\"taste\\" of Ayla's super-natural powers with numerous flashbacks but no real story or experience from them. The story dragged on forever with landscape details and back story telling.I have a question, supposedly these people travel on foot because they have never seen horses. Why did it take them over 2 days to go 20 or so miles to the Summer Meeting? Weren't Ayla and Jondalar doing that or more daily in the Plains of Passage. Where was the much talked about Clan encounter? This book was not consistent with the others.Each previous book has covered several years. This one covered 8 or 9 months? I hope the 6th book doesn't hurry through 30 years just to end the story, and I also hope it doesn't take another 12 years to finish."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As a fan excitedly anticipating this book, I couldn't wait to preorder and open it the day it arrived from Amazon. After reading one third of the story, I was ready to give up and use this 700-pager as a doorstop. Reading these reviews has actually been much more entertaining than the book itself. Ayla is so perfect and so Nancy Drew-nice, I want to smack her. I wish Jondalar would get bored himself and have an affair with a bad girl. And please, Jean, no description of minute-by-minute walking around and looking at scenery or conversational minutiae - it's BORING!! Your other books have been wonderful. Please get back the the exciting adventure and your readers will applaud."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited rather impatiently for the next book about Ayla, and the 11 year wait was a bit much, and then to have over half the book rehashing what I've already read in the first four was very disappointing. If Auel had cut out the Dickens-like descriptions that went on for pages and pages the book would have been a fraction of what it was. I have to say I skimmed pages at a time looking for something new to happen. The dialogue was very awkward especially toward the end of the book. There was so much repetition. I think I counted four descriptions of what Echozar looked like as a half Clan-half Other man!! There was way too much description of what everything looked like and what it was made of, minute descriptions. One that stands out in my mind was the description of the bag Jondalar carried the fat in to light their first lamp in he and Ayla's own dwelling. I didn't really care what it was made of in such minute detail and the description had nothing whatsoever to do with the story just an example of the Dickens-like description. All in all I was very disappointed and I had so looked forward to this book coming out. I will probably read the next one, but I'll wait and check it out from the library and I won't spend [money] to buy it. Hopefully I won't have to wait 11 years for it to come out or I may just lose interest entirely."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited over 10 years (like everyone else) however, the Shelters of Stone was not as good as I anticipated. I have read and re-read all of Ms. Auel's books numerous times. This story went on and on and on. Hundreds of pages passed and only one or two days passed in the book. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. It seemed that the last few pages at the end of the book was where things began to happen (birth of Jonayla and the birth of Whinney's foal). In previous books, Ayla lived in some more interesting cultures than with Jondular's Zelandoni people. Sorry Jean Auel, this book was not worth the wait. Maybe your last one will be better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Being an ardent Auel and Ayla fan, I found myself counting the moments until this book arrived. I clutched it to my chest, feeling the sweet release of knowing that I would soon have my fix of Jonadalar, Ayla, and painted caves. I was dissapointed.A great deal of the book was a repetion of the previous four. I didn't need to know that every time Ayla opened her mouth someone thought that her accent was \\"unusual, foriegn, yet not unpleasant\\", or how intensely, vividly blue Jondalar's eyes were. Even the characters \\"pleasuring\\" was redundent, and I began to wonder if they were also becoming bored with it as well.I read the entire book, skipping paragraghs throughout, because I have an affection for the story. I did appreciate that Jean Auel wrote the Zolena/Zelondoni character to be more than a charachature, not only full bodied, but a downright obese woman, with a sensuality, brilliance and power of her own. I found parts of the book to be intriguing, and wondered, for instance, how Zelondoni could feel so threatened by Ayla's power that she couldn't simply let the young woman be an at home mom and contributing member of the community. It was difficult to understand the reasons that the highest ranked member of the cave would stoop to manipulation rather than communication. I was also dissapointed that the author appeared to write the last two books together, and arbitrarily chose to end \\"Sheleters of Stone\\" mid sentence.I love these books, I want to love these books. I am passionate about petroglyphs,anthropology and the archeological research that went into the preparation for this series. This book hasn't dampered my interest in traveling to the Dordogne Valley, but it also didn't behoove me book a flight mid novel as I had hoped it would.I will read the last book when it comes out with all the exuberance of a true fan."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'll be honest--I wasn't expecting great things from Jean Auel's long-anticipated fifth novel in the Earth's Children series, because ... well, it was long anticipated. Anything hyped to this degree was bound to be a letdown.But even I was surprised at how hard it hit bottom.\\"The Shelters of Stone\\" reads almost like a mirror image of \\"The Mammoth Hunters,\\" down to an actual hunt. Auel spends tens of pages describing prehistoric fauna that I would swear to Zelandoni she described the same way in her previous books. Ayla is still Blond Cro-Magnon Supergirl, and Jondalar, pretty as he is, still tends to be whiny. We have the by-now-requisite woman lusting after Jondalar, the man who doesn't like Ayla, the deep priestess, and of course much exclaiming over Whinney, Racer and Wolf, not to mention wonder at Ayla's \\"inventions.\\" And don't forget the \\"flatheads are people too\\" sentiments. Yeah, Ayla and Jondalar finally get \\"mated\\" in this book, and Ayla pops out the baby, who is given the annoyingly cutesy name of Jonayla. That's it for new stuff. Auel has never mastered the art of giving newcomers enough information to figure out what's gone before while not boring the tears out of fans. Everything is explained at length repeatedly, making the reader feel like Auel thinks everyone is an idiot with no memory. Even the sex scenes are the same, albeit adapted a little to accommodate Ayla's pregnancy.There's supposedly one more book left in the series. Let's hope Jean goes out with a bang with that one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"No joy compared to mine when I saw that this book was coming out at the end of April 2002. I've been waiting over 11 years for this book! In preparation, I reread the first four before reading Shelters of Stone. Very bad idea; you'll notice right away that the pace of this book is quite different and there is a superficial depth to the characters. It seemed to read at a lower level and had the feel of a cheap romance novel, in a sense \\"dumbed down\\" or simplified. If you've read The Clan of the Cave Bear or The Valley of Horses, I hope you'll agree there wasn't a simple, cheap feel to them. I've read many series and this problem appears to happen a lot in the later books. Even the last few chapters of the Plains of Passage seem rushed, especially Ayla's meeting of Dalanar and the Lazandonii.I am disappointed that there wasn't more tension regarding Ayla being raised by the Clan. Jondalar's disgust and revulsion were so complete in the Valley of the Horses that it surprised me that his close kin discussed it so calmly and took the news so well in this book. But, of course, Jondalar has overreacted to a lot of things considering his society and traditions.The storyline regarding Ayla's acceptance by Earth's Children she is surrounded by (whether it be the Mamutoi, Zelandonii or Clan) is basically the same and, I agree, repetitive: Will they accept her? How can she prove she's acceptable? Will they let her stay or even belong? It's always Ayla's sure sense of self, pride, confidence, and her exceptional Gifts that allow her to stay, along with the support of the ones who love her most. Still, this time there was no open hostility or tension and Ayla's acceptance speech was moving.I think that I'm surprised most in Ayla's change of character. It's a subtle irony. She is still strong, capable, intelligent, quick to grasp meanings, a healer, a caretaker, etc, but she seems to exhibit a lot of the qualities she doesn't approve of in others. For example, she's quick to judge people \\"bad\\" before she knows them, is sometimes way too honest, and gets angry quickly and defensive even quicker. Of course, this is explained through her sense of righteousness and her strong will to help those in need showing through.The search for Thonolon's spirit was quite possibly the most interesting part of the book, especially considering it was a \`burden' to Jondalar's spirit since the second book. And I'm glad that Whinney and Ayla finally had their babies.I am looking forward to the next and last book of this series. I had a thought that maybe we're supposed to just meet and greet the new characters to the story in this novel. Get used to their names, their basic qualities and the lay of the land. Plus, tie up the loose ends of the previous books. It appears that the next book will deal more with the spiritual aspects I've enjoyed most in this series. I felt that this was missing in Shelters of Stone. In the previous books, I enjoyed the serendipity that allowed Ayla to discover the things that made her Ice Age life easier, especially since there was no people to tell her something could not be done just because no one had done it before. It's still the best lesson in Jean M. Auel's books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This really is a dreadful book. It's all setting, no plot. To save you the time, here's what happens: Ayla and hubby arrive at his hometown; Ayla demonstrates all her inventions; Ayla has baby. Yes, sportsfans, that's 750 pages worth! The book is hideously repetitive. If Ayla had shown off her Thread-Puller one more time, or if she enjoyed Pleasures with Jondalar again, I think I would have tossed my cookies. I wish Auel had written instead an anthropological treatise on early human life in southern France; that's what she's really interested in anyway. Definitely pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I would have thought it impossible to write a 741 page book and manage to say absolutely nothing. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cover how I feel about having spent good money on this book. I should've waited for the paperback edition, because then, at least, I could've traded it in at my book club. Repetition from the previous books in the series, coupled with reiterating passages from this worthless volume, made me skip several pages in disgust. In short, skip this one... you won't miss anything."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like so meny other Jean Auel fans, I was so eager to love this book like I have the four previous books in the series, but that didn't happen. Twelves years is a long time to wait for such a medicre story. It's really only half a book. One half is retelling the previous four stories and the other half is new story. New characters showed promise but were not developed well.I felt the author cheated me."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been waiting for years, and years, and years, and years for this, and words cannot begin to explain how disappointed I am. Perhaps I just worked up my expectations too high, but I feel as though Ms. Auel has strayed too far from the formula. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!I know that a tremendous amount of research went into the writing of this book, all her fans know that, she doesn't have to spend 350 pages convincing us that she did her homework. If she hadn't done her homework, this book would have been out ten years ago. On another note, I felt as though the narratives spent too much time preaching about evolutionary ideas and theories. If we didn't already buy the theory, chances are we wouldn't be buying the book.Don't get me wrong, I still read late into the night, and woke up early to read just a couple of pages before going to work, but this book didn't make me put off doing dinner, dishes, dusting, or laundry as I had expected it would.The book started sort of slow, and then sped up too fast. It seemd like the first 300 pages were the first week they were \\"home\\", then things began to move at quantum speed. On top of that, every time something interesting happened it was glossed over in favor of more talk about the animals!Ok, so I was disappointed, but all in all, I still can't wait for the next book -- I hope it's back to the old formula -- new experiences, not the same experience over and over again."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Really should be negative stars. I enjoyed the first four Earth's Children books and looked forward to the one where Jondalar and Ayla finally get home. What a disappointment! The story is VERY slow and repetitive. The theme of Ayala and Jondalar as superwoman and superman has become tiresome, as has the emphasis placed on their discovery of animal domestication and the fire-starting properties of certain stones. The discoveries of other people are mentioned only in passing. At one point there is a brief description of what sounds like woven cloth, which in previous books would have fascinated Ayla until she made the technique her own: in this story it is just dropped.Ayla keeps having the same conflicts with the new people she meets, over and over and over. Ayla and Jondalar always seem so oblivious to signs of trouble; and they are completly surprised, shocked and hurt when a troublemaker insults or confronts them. There are even more conflicts in this installment and almost none of them are resolved by the end of this book. Previous Earth's Children stories all ended at a logical place, where a reader could extrapolate a satisfactory future for the protagonists, but the ending of Shelters of Stone leaves too many loose ends and screams \\"stay tuned for the sequel!\\" For the sake of devoted fans, I hope it doesn't take anywhere near as long to write and has better editing. My advice on this book: if you have to read it, check it out at the library and spend your money on something else."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I don't understand why it took Ms. Auel so long to write this book. Almost half of it is either a rehashing of what took place in earlier books or the same thing happening over and over again in this book. The plot also does not advance much. She spends many pages describing the imaginary scenery, which seems beautiful but not necessary to the story. She does introduce many characters, but the character development is limited to only a select few. Indeed, a character introduced early on who appears to be a main protagonist, is then summarily dropped except for a couple of casual mentions 400 pages later. Finally, large spans of time are allowed to proceed without any text. All of a sudden a whole season goes by with only 50 or so pages of text. The book did progress the story, but the same amount of progression could have been done in 100 pages. It feels as if this book was just filler till the next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have waited, like everybody else, SO LONG for the continuation of the series and built my hopes SO HIGH, that it was, I guess, inevitable that the book would be a bit of a disappointment.The bits and pieces that were new and original were far and few in between large chunks of recycled paragraphs. So I found myself skipping pages to come to some new information.On the other hand, mistakes aside, it is still a fascinating read, albeit a bit flawed one - why, all of a sudden, Ms Auel feels that she has to show that Ayla rolls her r's? This is a new and unwelcome development which only appears once in a while. I mean, either she does or she doesn't!That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed that book 6 will answer all our questions and finally quench our thirst."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It took me 3 days to read it, as much as I liked the first 4 books I to was disapointed. All those name repetition. Jean could have just be that they all introduce themselve without thos names. and all those pages of describing the area. I to scipped pages. the ending left me hangging and wanting more. I would have like more action between characters. It left me wondering about Lanoga and lanidar. What about Marona, Laranar and Brukeval? And what is the deal with the Zelandonia? Do they end up trading with the Clan? I mean, there ae too many loose ends. She could have don better. It seems another book may be on the way but I just hope is better.I gave it a 3 beause Im a big fan. Jean if you are reading this \\"PLEASE STOP THE REPETITION AND ALL THOSE DESCRIPTIONS PLEASE\\""},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read the first four books so many times my friends tease me that I can recite long passages. I say this to give some means of valuation of my opinion. OK here goes. I was disappointed in the book. I cannot uderstand why it took so long to write. The book uses pages and pages of quotes (word for word) from previous books, renames charactrers that appeared in other books and presents them as new--they are not--and uses scenes and situations from previous books that are hardly reworked just name changes (the young man who is attacked and Ayla rushes to the rescue and sets the bones. Sound familiar? check Valley of Horses). Just one more example: The child that is shunned in the Mamouth Hunters is presented again in this book under a different name with a different handicap but the situation is the same. Much material in the book is repeated needlessly. The book needs a good editing. There are contridictions within this book and constridictions of material in the previous books. I thought it was poorly organized and that there was no real plot just aimless wandering with little or no connection. After so many years of waiting it was quite a let down."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been eagerly waiting for this book for years, scanning book review journals every month to see if it's been released yet. I loved the story, but the repetition was somewhat boring. Auel told over and over of the people's reaction to Ayla's animals and \\"her (Ayla's)big, beautiful smile\\" was really starting to get on my nerves by the end of the book. Also, I kept expecting something terrible (death/destruction) to happen with the Marona and/or Brucheval and it never did. I also thought the endless description of the landscape (right,left, north, south) was too much for me. Tell me about heading up the river to the camp but leave out all the directions. I'm not really going there for heaven's sake!Even with these criticisms though, I would recommend this book to other fans of the series, in fact, I can't wait till the last books is published to finally finish Ayla's story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After finishing \\"Plains of Passage\\" years ago, I closed the book thinking that there was so much more I wanted to know. Frankly, I had the same impression after finishing \\"Shelters of Stone\\". This is not necessarily a criticism, but a caution for those people who like everything tied up neatly at the end of a book.It almost seems that Jean Auel may have written two books worth of material, and just broke this off at a convienent stopping point. There is still more of the story to be told, and I'm looking forward to it. The characters are still compelling and the description of prehistoric living is interesting."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I think of what the fifth book COULD have been like, yes this book was dissapointing. I feel let down, because I thought there was a fantastical element to Ayla's Saga. Throughout the series I felt, Auel was hinting at greater things to come for our heroine. But then again, I don't think we can expect \\"The Clan Of The Cave Bear\\" in this, or in any of the other books really. I think Auel is pulled between the \\"scientific and realism\\" (the repeating of landscape, herbal remedies etc.) and the \\"melodramtic and fantasy\\" of this series. I was hoping for more of the \\"fantastic and dramatised\\" element in this book but it wasn't to be. And when I think, perhaps Auel is really trying to depict, a closer telling of what life would have been like in the IceAge, I guess this book, is not so bad."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I can't believe I read this. What a waste. I echo what other reviewers have written.Padantic sex scenes, boring characters and no plot. These people just meander through the same stories and plots of the previous books, only with different names.Where was editorial?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I found this fifth book in the Earth Children series much too long and repetitious. I was getting pretty sick of hearing how Ayla found and trained her horses and her wolf......I found the previous four books of this series much more interesting. However, I plan to read Miss Auel's next book, but I sure hope it does not take her twelve years to write it like it did this one. I'm a senior citizen and cannot afford to wait too long......Miss Auel did much research about the people who lived 30,000 years ago in the limestone caves of this story..... Ayla and Jondalar complete their long journey to arrive at the home of Jondalar's people who are called Zalondonii.......The tame horses and wolf are a wonder to the Zalondonii as their limestone caves, artifacts, and customs are to Ayla. Most of Jondalar's people accept Ayla, but some do not......This book ends with the main characters starting a family of their own.....Hope the next book follows soon."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As usual Ms Auel repeats herself constantly, telling you the same thing she went through a few chapters ago. Again we hear of his blue eyes and her accent on almost every page. Ayla's history is repeated over and over again. ... The average reader will not remember that this is 99% pure fantasy and 1% fact on the artifacts. Perhaps Ms Auel's next book should be Science Fiction where her mix of customs and language would not be so jarring. Put it on another planet and it might be more digestable."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like so many others, I was anxious to read Jean Auel's new book. How very disappointing. Where oh where was the editor? It wasn't just the repetitions from previous books; but repetitions from 3 pages back that were jarring. If you've enjoyed this series, skip this book and see if she can do any better on the next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I too read all of Jean M. Auels' previous novels and while I LOVED, LOVED The Clan of the Cave Bear each successive book went downhill. However, I wasn't quite prepared for the lengthy, wordy, descriptive (ad nauseum) story in her latest effort. I agree her research is intense and obviously feels very strongly about it but I wanted to read this book for a fun summer read, not a lecture on prehistoric man/woman. I also agree with a previous review, the characters are very one dimensional - the good people are good and the bad people are bad. I am loathe to put a book down once I start it, however I was tempted many times with this one. Now that I have finally finished it, I have no plans to read any future installments."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I kept doggedly reading, hoping to return to the storyteller I had found in the first 4 books. Never happened. Was there an editor? Ayla's story deserves to be told without endless repetition of descriptions of scenery, introductions to characters that are never developed, and story lines that are started and then dropped without any explanation. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I imagine it is not fair of me to review a book I had no desire to continue with... And it is so rare for me NOT to labor on with a book searching for whatever is redeeming within its bindings...but in this case, I agree completely with the reviewer missingtexas. The writing style is monotonous, I could care less about the characters, and the larger themes and \\"issues\\" e.g. racial discrimination of \\"flatheads\\" as reflection of our current societies ills was so contrived. Insultingly simple, irretrievably dull!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It seems that the characters were just a bit too modern. When I began this series, I had to wait a year for the 3rd book. It was worth the wait. These books delve into a world I had never even considered. Each was a refreshing insight into strange people. The historical 'truth' in it only made it that much more exciting... Yet with this book, the characters seemed more like modern day people, living in a cave! Her other books were so refreshingly unique I found this one to be nothing more than a common novel, with little plot. Her extensive descriptions of caves and utensils carry your interest somewhat as they are most probably based on quite a bit of fact. But the extensive descriptions of human behavior would seem to be only creations of her own mind, and are a bit too \\"modern\\" to be able to match the 'revelations' in previous books. Over-all I found it disappointing. Maybe it is a necessary build-up to the final book? Although it may have lacked plot, her writing, as always, is exceptional."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"i found this book very interesting and exciting, as i actually read this fisrt, due to my mum thinking it was the first in the series. i think other people might have found it slightly boring because it focuses totally on jondalars people and how Ayla interacts, yet this is in a way the same as the first book of the series (which i've now read), as that focused on how she interacted with the Clan. i would reccomend this to anyone who has read the other books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Unlike most of the gang here, I only \\"discovered\\" Jean Auel's books about a month ago. I picked up Plains of Passage and was enthralled with Ms. Auel's delightful way of bringing human pre-history into a believable story. I went out and bought the first three books to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and enjoyed them all immensely. Having then read the whole series up to book #4, I decided to splurge and treat myself to a hardcover of JA's latest Shelters of Stone.Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in this 741-page tome. I have to agree with most of the negative reviews here. I think the most frustrating aspect for me about this book is that JA layed the groundwork for some potentially interesting plot twists with the characters of Marona, Brukeval, Laramar and Madroman and the white quartz cave, but then failed to use them to create anything more than minor tension in the plot. I get the feeling that she was just setting the stage for book #6, but if SoS is any indication, she'll have to reintroduce all those potential villains in the next book anyway, so we'll be stuck with more copy and paste boilerplate in book six.Did I say the best thing about this was the endflap maps? Actually, they would have been much more useful if they had included the names and locations of each of the Zelandonii caves on the maps instead of just their place names. Also, having all the Zelandonia with the same name only differentiated by cave number was bad enough, but then she sticks in the four Zelondoni of the 29th cave to really confuse things.I agree with some of the other reviewers: Zelondoni of the 9th Cave was the most interesting new character in the book -- kind of a cross between Mother Superior and Bloody Mary in South Pacific. It's a shame JA has returned Jondalar to being Ayla's two-dimensional sex slave -- I really liked the way JA fleshed him out as a confused and jealous lover in Mammoth Hunters. Now that (Mammoth Hunters) was a really thoughtful illustration of the problems we all face in communicating our feelings and how easy it is to let a simple misunderstanding spiral out of control.Will I buy book #6? Probably, as long as it doesn't take another 12 years to write."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a fan of Jean Auel's books, and remember waiting for plains of Passage to be released. If I remember right, it felt like years. I suspect that several people, like myself, were dissapointed a little in the change in writing style, and more importantly, the lack of depth that the book seemed to have.Here, Jean Auel makes a recovery. I was unnerved dropping a hard-cover price on this book after being so dissapointed with the last one, but fortunately I was not dissapointed this time. It is a nice read, full of detail, and fortunately Ayla lost that vapid ignorance spell she seemed to pick up in the earlier book. There seems to be a bit of an issue finding the 'plot', per se, but as the whole series seems to have wholly drifted into the romance genre that is not surprising. Fortunately, it is not laid on unbearably thick in this novel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I bought the whole series (The Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters, Plains of Passage, The Shelters of Stone) so I could relive the excitement I felt when I first read them years ago. By the time I finished the Plains of Passage, I was getting bored with the repetition. Then I started Shelters and was so disappointed I wanted to scream, it was worse! Much worse! How many times do we have to hear the Iza taught Ayla to wash after sex? This book was a disappointment. I hope Ms. Auel doesn't rely on previous material in the final book of the series to fill in the space between the covers!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"i have read the entire series within two months of getting the first and am compelled to say that i have never in my life read anything so good. This tale of a foreign women who travels the world with her beloved is so detailed and heart wrenching that there will never be a time while reading this book that you will not laugh, cry, or be bedazzled by this wonderful character. i write this rewiew in high regard and Jean M. AUel has so inspired me that i am determined to write a saga book and be an author."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"My first thought on completing this book was, \\"I waited years...for THIS?\\" It was almost as if Auel calculated to write ANYTHING AT ALL to keep this series going without actually completing a single storyline. I continued reading in hopes the next chapter would offer the plot continuity I'd come to expect from Auel and-gosh darn it!- at least a few of the answers/resolutions I'd waited on for a decade. Ha!I'll still have the almost-sick compulsion to read the next (final?) installment. Maybe it will contain the delicious meat of her prior books.When and if it's all finally said and done, this will be the book in the series to tell your friends to skip."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is the 5th installment of the Earth's Childern series. The action picks up from the end of the previous book, Plains of Passage. Ayla and Jondalar have at last reached his family after trekking across what is now eastern Europe to southern France.Criticism has been made that the books are repetitious. I found that while there is definitely rehashing of actions from previous books that it was no more than is found in other series. This book, like the others in the series, could be read and enjoyed by itself or the series could be read out of sequence and still understood.Some have complained that Ayla is some sort of a supergenius who discovered 'everything'. This IS a work of fiction, there never was an 'Ayla', a single person who had all of these experiences or made all of these discoveries but her experiences are all possible and probably did happen to others. All of the advances Ayla made, domesticating animals, sewing together wounds, needles etc were made by somebody during this time period. Actually they were probably made many times by many different people throughout the world over many centuries.The author brings to life a time period that we have only scant circumstantial evidence about. Her world is probably a much nicer place than what really existed but it is a thorough depiction of a possible society of this time.This is an enjoyable read and I am waiting for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am only half way through, and probably will not finish!!This is a big disapointment.

Personally I would like a refund!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I actually read the whole series over a summer, so I was not among the excited fans waiting for this book.

She has courage and a strong will.\\" Who would say this? \\"Well, if you need anything...\\" Yes, we realize Ayla is pretty, blah blah blah. Ayla is portrayed as waaaay too perfect, and if someone like this exists, it shouldn't be jealous and spoiled Jondalar who gets her. Thonolan, maybe.WHEN OH WHEN OH WHEN... The reader spends the book waiting for the mating of Ayla and Jondalar, and then for the birth of Jonayla (bad bad bad name).FRUSTRATION I was really excited upon the meeting of Brukeval and read through the book searching for his name, but there were no developements.GOODY TWO SHOES The whole poor family thing and how Ayla helps them through is page wasted.REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT We rehear the stories of Ayla and Jondalar, the excitement over their now not-so-new inventions, the titles of everyone again and again and again.Sorry folks, Clan was a classic. This is a downfall.Jean M.

In fact, I didn't get it right away based on the terrible Amazon reviews!Honestly, I do not see what everyone's problem is. Yes, Jean is in need of an editor--that's been obvious from the beginning. I'm an editor myself and yes, she repeats herself from time to time. She does that in all of the books. This isn't fine literature here, folks--it's entertainment. :)Now, about this book. It's not terrible, but not the best book from the series either. No, there's not a lot of adventure because it focuses mainly on character development and Ayla's relationship with the Zelandonii. It also talks about her pregnancy with Jondalar and her relationship with the Zelandoni (first among those who serve the mother, who was Jondalar's red-foot that he fell so hard for). It's a really fascinating dynamic.The one thing that got annoying is the very long poem that gets repeated time and time again, and I just skimmed over it after the first time through.I really don't understand how people can complain about the length of the book and the lengthy descriptions of life back then. That's in all of the books. I wonder how many of the negative reviews are written based on their rosy memories of the past books, which they may not have read recently.So basically, don't believe all of the reviews. Check it out from the library and see for yourself (that's what I did). I for one was not disappointed and intend to buy the book. :)"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting 11 years I was really disappointed. It seemed that everytime someone new was introduced, it took three paragraphs to tell who they were.

A very drawn out tale, not what I had expected."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the long wait since book four, and considering that I thoroughly enjoyed the other four books in the series. However, this book for me was nothing but a brain dulling barrage of introductions and recaps of the other books in the series. In fact, I must admit that I did not finish reading this book. After 200 pages of pure \\"nothing,\\" I finally decided to discard it. I had help with this decision, though. A good friend of mine began listening to the book on tapes at the same time I began reading. She finished--only because she has a long commute and nothing better to do--and quickly informed me that absolutely \\"nothing\\" happens, that there is no drama, action, or any form of brain teasing within the pages of this new book from Jean Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is equivalent to my 6th grader's book report.

Sure, this book was not as exciting as the first couple but that's because all the main characters were new, the scenery was new, etc. Was the auther supposed to change the characters and the scenery just to keep things exciting? And yes, like in all of her books there were a lot of detailed descprtions of landscapes and animals, but these books are the some of the only books I have read where I could actually feel myself there and vividly picture the events unfolding. Honestly would it have been better if she had just written \\"There are these people that live in these caves and hunt some animals\\". I really enjoyed the book, I enjoyed reading about Ayla and Jondalar settling into their mated life and looking forward to their new family. I guess if I have one criticizm it would have to be the ending, I really expected to turn the page and read more, but it just kind of ended abruptly. However I still enjoyed the book and know others that did too and would recommend it to any one who is a fan of this series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It was to be expected that, after keeping her reading public waiting so long, Jean Auel would attract some pretty harsh criticism for this book. I think this is because, sadly, readers want to \\"punish\\" her for making them wait. I would agree that this part of the saga is not as sharply written as the first four books but, perhaps this is because, the first book especially was such a phenomenon that all succeeding stories would suffer by comparison.Although some of the descriptive passages are rather tedious, if one was coming new to Auel and the Earth's Children series, the background is necessary to understanding the setting and parameters within which the author places her narrative and characters. However, the author does tackle some pretty universal issues here even if the development of them is less than completely satisfying. There is a core of a love story; a romance, if you will. However, I can't really see how else Auel could move the story along unless she centred it on domestic (eg emotional) interaction. This is, afterall fiction and entertainment!I felt the criticism some of have made of her justifying years of research a little unfair for she does use a great deal of intuitive and imaginative flair to create and people a world that, frankly, none of us can really comprehend. I usually run a mile from anything that smacks of fantasy or sci-fi. I had, in the beginning, to be dragged kicking and screaming to the Earth's Children series many years ago but have come to appreciate the great original effort and unquestioned reflective scholarship that has brought such entertainment to so many around the world.I hope to see the concluding book soon and I hope to see it more sharply written.

I plan to keep it near my nightstand for the next 12 years - just in case I have trouble dozing off. I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and really enjoyed the next 3 books, but this book is nothing more than a 700 page description of the way the continent of Europe looked 30,000 years ago. BORING stuff. As for the brilliant Ayla, she is relegated to a pathetic shell of her former self. I agree with all the other reviewers about the boring sex scenes, rehash of the Clan ways, etc. etc. That hunt on the 2nd day (page 250 thru 280 or so) was very contrived. They were so greedy they had to have 2 hunts? This was done more to show off Ayla's skill and Jondular's spear than to entertain the reader. It seems that way too much in this book is just 'filler'. I will not run out and buy the sixth book Ms. Auel. When I hear it's been published, I'll re-read Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I was in 7th grade my mom made me read Clan and Valley then forbade me to read Mammoth and Plains, I did anyways. I GREW up with Ayla, wishing I could be her friend when I was little. I waited 12 years for this!?You'd think that with 12 years Jean could do something better. I've been waiting all this time for the baby, then she comes and it doesn't seem to be a big deal like Durc was. No drama.I did like the last three or so pages, and I did like the last paragraph or two, I think they were more like the other books. And I will read the sixth, but if I have to wait another 12 years to do it, I am probably not going to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited so long for this book, as did everyone, and was totally disappointed. I won't go into a long comment, but the book was very WORDY!!! Nothing new happened. She repeated a lot of what was in the last book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ok everyone, I written a review back on the 14th of May. And have looked over all the other reviews. For those of us who are HIGHLY disappointed~ I feel we need to write our \\"Beloved\\" Ms. Auel and hopefully she will get the point. For I truely hope she is not glossing over all this just to finish the series and end it.She has worked so hard on the previous books .. is she suffering from writers block ?!Perhaps she needs to make the next and final book a readers choice~ a interactive one. Where we can choose which way we want to go with the story. You know those book types, we used to read them as a child. Choose # 4 if you want the hero to enter the house. If not choose # 5 to go on to the bay.I am just so chessed off, that we waited so long for a book that now can be use as a door stop, a weapon and /or toliet paper (depending on one's up bringing and plumbing). Either way folks we have taken it up the windward channel~ for Ms. Auel did not live up to expectations and/or her editors need hooked on phonics or they suffer from obessive compulsive disorders. Where they have to repeat everything about a hundred times.Pehaps we need to have a EARTH CHILDREN's support group."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is sort of a blanket review of the whole Earth's Children series,as far as it has gone so far. The story line is worth 3 1/2 to 4stars at least but the writing that went into it is worth no morethan 1 star at best and should be awarded less if thet were possibleEach time a new volumn has come out I have re-read the series frombook 1 as well as several additional readings in between. Withrespect to what I will be saying below this may be hard to believebut after reading the Clan of the Cave Bear I expected much more fromthe rest of the series and kept going back to look for it. Needlessto say I never found it.I have just spent several hours going over at least 30+ reviews ofeach of the five volumns of the series published to date (Iunderstand there will now be seven books in the series rather thanthe original plan of ending the set with book six).The first book, The Clan of the Cave Bear, was good reading,especialy for people not expert in pre-historic civilizations. Thecharacters were fairly well developed and the story line was clearcut. To my mind the first and worst mistake Ms Auel made was toatribute psycic powers to the neanderthals and having them born withall the memories of ther direct ancestors for untold generationsalready in their brains. This should not have been unecessary and itchanged the whole theme from her originally stated plan of historicfiction to pure fantasy. As far as books 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the series,if you take most of the comments from all the reviewers who awardedeach of them only 1 or 2 stars you will have a pretty good picture ofthe authors ability as a story teller. It is obvious the Ms Auel'scontract with the publisher allows her to be paid by the word foreach of these stories and this may be her only source of income. Ifthe editor, if there was one, had removed even most of the repetitionthe page count for each of these last four books would have beenreduced by at least 60 to 70 percent.I have yet to see another author show such utter contempt for theinteligence of their readers as Ms Auel has done with this series.The only explanation I can think of is that she is writing for thosewith an attention span of a three or four year old. I didn't mindseveral pages on the different grasses growing on the iceage tundra- the first time. But when I see the same text almost word for worda second time and then a third and fourth time in the same book itgets tiersome, especially when the same descriptions show up justas often in the next two books as well. I am no prude, I have readmy share of 'R' and, yes, even 'X' rated stories, but even there Ihave seldom found an author so obsessed with the need to expresssexuality in such detail. I can't understand how your 13 and 14year old reviewers ever got hold of copies to read, especiallythose who mention finding them in school libraries.Other than the repetition the most common complaints were made aboutAyla being a 'super-woman-genius' inventing everything known to manfrom flint fire starting to surgical sutures. (I think some readersexpected hot air baloons to help them cross the glacier and maybe anuclear reactor in the deeper caves.) The one thing that this makesvery clear to me was that NOT ONE SINGLE REVIEWER SEEMED TO REMEMBERWHAT THE 'EARTH'S CHILDREN' SERIES WAS ALL ABOUT! This set of bookswas supposed to show the development of humanity from the Neanderthalthrough, at least, the Cro-magnon peoples. The inventions appearingin the stories took place over tens of thousands of years at least.If you would only pay attention to what you are reading you willnotice that each group of people Ayla comes in contact with issomewhat more advanced than the last in social structure and/orsurvival techniques. During her journey Ayla has not traveled justa thousand miles or so, she has also traveled at least a hundredthousand years. Ayla is not a single person except as a means ofcarrying the story of mankind foward. If you can considered her asthe 'spirit' of MAN moving through history many of these complaintson the story line can be ignored. I only wish the same could applyto the lack of writing ability on the part of the author. I haveseen better written stories come out of 7th and 8th grade Englishclasses."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The author is obsessed with her exploration of the historic sights and forces descriptions of minutiae on us that add nothing to the story; in fact, they take the place of character development and divert the story line.As much as I liked the first three in the series, I put this one down for good just over half through. I would give NO stars if the rating system allowed that."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'm sorry to say, and sorry to use this language, but it sucked.

I have no idea as to what the point of this book is! It is slow, overly attentive to detail, and oversimplifies the obvious. The explanations and \\"origins\\" of things we are accustomed to are laughable. Do not waste your time on this book. Life is way to short!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'm sorry. This book was a real disappointment. I read and then reread ALL of Auel's books as I would await the next book(s). When I saw the size of the latest I was just SURE it would be full of new adventures and stories of Ayla &amp; Jondolar. But that was not the case. I found the book to be uninteresting and dull in comparison to her previous 4 books.Actually, I was left with a feeling that Jean Auel did not write this book. The first 4 books left me always waiting for the next book. Not so with this book.Jean Auel could have summed up what happened in this entire book inside of two chapters. Don't know what happened to her style or her story. Like I said earlier . . . I just don't believe she wrote this book.What a shame."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am determined to get through this dragged out, repetitious disappointing book, no matter what! I've read all Jean's other Children of the Earth Series and will not read any further ones.I think Jean forgets this is supposed to be set in the days of the CAVEMEN. Having a \\"quiet cup of tea\\" and figuring out not only does a woman's menses come when the moon is the same each month but also that the \\"dominent female in a household usually sets the time for all females in that group to get their period also is quite advanced for that time! Seems it wasn't too long algo that modern folks figured that out. Almost every page gives me reason to say, \\"Oh Good Grief....!\\" I'm still waiting for Ayla to come out with a stone version of the modern computer. It seems that Jean takes our modern world and changes a few, minute things, and thinks it makes a plausible leap. NOT !!I am taking FOREVER to finish this book, but I'm determined to see if there are ANY redeeming pages in it. It is no longer a story of an ancient people. With all the experts she supposedly consulted and visited with, you'd think there might be a bit more authenticity put forth in the book. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I couldn't bring myself to get past the first hundred pages.

While I know the characters are fiction, I know she has written wonderful descriptions about how the world must have been in that time period. Thank you, Jean, I can hardly wait for the next one. Please don't make us wait as long as we have for this one.I can only say, read the book, you will love it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Did I mention repetition?I came away feeling somewhat lukewarm towards this much-anticipated book. Definitely, there were enjoyable parts to it, even parts that moved me to tears.However, this book had a much different pace to it than what I've come to expect from this series. For every event, it reviewed experiences from the earlier books in tiresome detail. Later in the book, it even reviewed experiences that happened in the first part of the book.And, really, how many times did we have to read about the people's first reaction to meeting Wolf, Whinney, and Racer? Yes, the animals were new to the people, but they were not new to the readers. Recounting the same reaction from the dozens of people that met the animals as well as the never-ending recitation of all the formal names and ties of the characters made for tedious reading.I'll admit to skipping the long narratives to get to the action. In the earlier books I was fascinated at Ms. Auel's extraordinary talent of setting the scene with lots of rich details. In this book, it just seemed to make the story plod, maybe because I had read most of it before.This book is a definite, if somewhat disappointing, read for those that have been captivated by this series. I find myself eagerly awaiting the next book. I only hope the author once again warms to her subject and the plot instead of relying on page-fillers from past books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"First off, I'm very glad that I got this from the library and didn't waste my money.This book hardly justifies a 12 year wait for some fans. 3 years, in my case. It's boring, repetitive, and doesn't even offer anything significant to justify its incredible length.What about all the buildup, the incredible conflict we expected? What about Zolena, Jondalar's former lover, being a possible factor between Ayla and Jondalar? Nope, she has to be incredibly fat and thus sexually undesirable, an effectively neutered woman. Jondalar's former fiancee is portrayed as completely rabid and malicious, when she's more than entitled to a little resentment of Ayla and Jondalar. The man *jilted* her, after all. But no, if you dislike Ayla, that makes you rotten to the core.The Zelandoni prejudice against the people of the Clan that we were all so afraid of? Dealt with in one tiny scene wherein all Zelandoni are ooing and ahhing over Ayla's sign language. Give me a break. That's disgustingly unreal, and a disgrace after all the hype about it for the past three books.The \\"villains\\" are cardboard stereotypes. Those who aren't immediately enthralled by Ayla we *surprisingly* find are bad, evil people. I'm in mind of Frebec from \\"MH\\" here...he was a fully developed quasi-villain whose transformation was within the realms of belief. No such luck here. They're totally bad and have the utter gall to try and humiliate or hurt dear Ayla.Ayla makes no faux pas, saves every situation with perfect panache, enchants everybody despite her having been raised by (and having had sex with) \\"animal flatheads\\". (Which everybody conveniently accepts despite long-standing prejudice that's been harped on for the past three books.) In fan fiction there is a word for a beautiful, incredibly talented, and universally liked perfect young woman. It's a \\"Mary Sue\\", and it is not a complimentary term.Ayla's lost all depth she had in \\"Cave Bear\\" to become the original Cro-Magnon Mary Sue, perfect in every way. Every Paleolithic (and some Neolithic!) innovation can apparently be traced to her somehow: the atlatl (spear thrower), iron pyrite as a fire striker, animal domestication, the needle, the concept of conception via sexual intercourse being just a few.I'm just waiting for her to invent the wheel. Though she probably will as First Among Those Who Serve the Mother (come on, you know she'll have the spot soon enough.) I much prefer the uncertain, definitely flawed and definitely human Ayla of \\"CotCB\\" instead of this prissy, power-hungry, perfect and boring woman. Give us a normal woman with fears, flaws, and all, instead of this laughable, inane Super-Ayla.Jondalar is also disgustingly perfect, though he's basically just Ayla's stud and bodyguard. I'm also amused by the fact that the copious, purple-prosed love scenes seem to portray him as merely a one-trick pony. (So much for his prowess in the furs). This increasing trend towards nauseating perfection has annoyed me slightly since it began in \\"VoH\\" and has increased steadily with every book. Perhaps Thonolan should have survived that cave lion attack in Jondalar's place...The characters have become cardboard, mere shadows of what they could have been, should have been. What they were promised to be when we first met them and they enchanted us. Many good books have been ruined with multiple steadily more awful sequels. Laurie R. King's \\"The Beekeeper's Apprentice\\" is one. \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is another. Ms. Auel should have left it at the end of \\"CotCB\\" and been remembered for that splendid masterpiece instead of cranking out ever worsening tripe *ad nauseum*, justifying it by, \\"It continues the storyline.\\"How about Ayla being an outcast from Zelandoni society because of her past? How about that causing strife with Jondalar, torn between love and his people? That was the book we should have received, the book that previous volumes promised us. Instead we find the couple happily married and accepted, with unquestioned incredibly high status, showering benevolence and help upon all who are needy. Is this supposed to be a parody, a farce?This book has no conflict. This book has no action. This book has positively no character development. This book practically deconstructs any good done in \\"CotCB\\" and \\"VoH\\". In fact, this book has absolutely *nothing* to justify spending 28 dollars and 12 years of anticipation. Any first-time writer sending this in would be firmly rejected and laughed at. \\"SoS\\" indeed--very apt. Send out the distress call and load the lifeboats, because this one plummets to the bottom fast under the weight of its own bloated self-importance. A solid F."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...The Shelters of Stone is not a good book, and it is not a bad book that is fun. It's such an incredible departure from Auel's other books that I question whether she actually wrote it herself. Let me tell you why.In the previous Earth's Children books, she tended to get somewhat flowery and overblown with descriptions of, say, prehistoric tundra landscapes or intricate cultural customs. But the overblown descriptions were at least engaging. She's never been a master of character development -- the characters have always been very one-sided, with the good people being superhumanly good and the bad people being very, very bad -- but at least she made you care about the characters to some extent. And she's never been particularly excellent at writing dialogue, but at least every once in awhile she'd hit upon something poignant, or funny, or interesting.None of these things happen in the Shelters of Stone.The book is a cold, stilted, haphazard, frankly [weak] attempt at continuing the story of Ayla, who loyal readers have known and loved and been following for over 20 years now. The characters are cut from cardboard and stuck in at random intervals where it seems convenient, not to move the story along. Not that there's much of a story -- frankly, about 3/4 of the book is exposition from the previous 4 books. Very little actually happens in Shelters of Stone that you haven't seen happen in the previous books. Ayla and Jondalar meet the Zelandonii, and then every time they meet someone new there's the endless round of introductions, they have to explain Ayla's background, how she got the animals, the spear-throwers, the firestones, etc. etc. ad nauseum.There is thankfully much less explicit sex in this book than in the former books, but Auel more than makes up for the tedious sex scenes with the tedious exposition of covered territory over and over and over. Events that should be touching -- weddings, deaths, births -- are glossed over or ham-handedly dealt with, but then followed by pages and pages of Ayla and Jondalar explaining Ayla's background, which we've known the most intimate details of for four books now. I found myself skipping large portions of chapters just so I could get to the next part that actually had something to do with the story.The dialogue between the characters is so awkward it's painful at times -- it sounds like an 8th-grader's first effort at writing a skit for the school play. The narrative, dialogue and plot careen from point to point, emotion to emotion with seemingly no direction or finesse. Some of the details that have been consistent through the last four books are now different in this book, like the spelling of a major character's name. There were some great opportunities to tell parts of the story we hadn't heard before, about Jondalar's background, but none of those were explored in favor of having Ayla explain for the umpteenth time to some person how she trained Wolf. Also, whoever edited this book needs to be fired, because on top of the numerous problems discussed above, there are comma splices, sentence fragments and other grammatical problems throughout the book. Maybe Ms. Auel was given final edit; if so, that was a really, really bad idea.If Ms. Auel was a new writer and not an established author with several bestsellers backing her up, there's no way this book would have seen the light of day. There are too many literary problems with this novel to even enumerate here. Frankly, the book stunk. It was painful for me to read it, and I was actually sorry afterwards that I had spent money on a hardback.I wanted so much to love this book. I had a bad feeling when I read the first two advance chapters in my bookstore late last year -- the writing just didn't seem up to par with her previous efforts. I honestly believe that Auel only wrote maybe 25 percent of the book, and the editors hastily cobbled together the other 75 percent out of the last four books. I understand there's a sixth book in the works. I'll be waiting for the (used) paperback on that one. It kills me to say this, but if this is the best Auel can do, maybe she should think about retirement."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"My first reaction when I finally turned the last page of \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" was \\"I waited twelve years for THIS?\\" Indeed, the only thing that made me stick with the reading until the last page was the forlorn hope that Auel would stop repeating herself and maybe something interesting would happen.Like many \\"Earth's Children\\" fans, I waited with bated breath to see what might finally happen when the sexy cave hero Jondalar brings the even sexier cave heroine Ayla back home to meet his people. We'd already been led in previous books to believe that Ayla's introduction to the Zelandoni would be anything but smooth. The Zelandoni (we have been told) believe that the Neanderthals who raised Ayla are animals and any children produced from Neanderthal-Human trysts are \\"abominations.\\" Particularly intriguing were what we imagined might happen when Ayla met Jondalar's old love, Zolena (who is now \\"Zelandoni of the Ninth Cave,\\" and who in a mere five years has become a gargatuan image of the woman Jondalar loved; so we no longer have to anticipate a conflict between Ayla and the most powerful Zelandoni priestess. Would've been fascinating, but oh well!), his old ex-fiancee Marona, and his powerful but prideful mother, Marthona. How would Ayla, whom we know as fiercely protective of her Neanderthal adoptive family, react to a people who might judge her based on her past history with these \\"animals?\\" We couldn't wait to find out! And what would Jondalar do, who in previous books was torn between his intense love for Ayla and his worry over what his family might think? Oh please tell us!So, what happened? Ayla meets Jondalar's family. They think she's kind of strange, but nice (several of them fall in love with her). Ayla meets the rest of Jondalar's people. They think she's kind of strange, but nice(several of them fall in love with her). She goes to the Summer meeting and meets a lot of other people. Mostly, they all think she's kind of strange, but nice (several of them fall in love with her.) A few think she's kind of strange and are intensely jealous that everyone else thinks she's nice ... although it is made clear that anyone who doesn't love Ayla has serious problems. One of these is the Cave drunk, who lusts after her body but is offended because she's given more status than he. Then there's the ex-fiance Marona, a character who isn't even believably realistic. She turns out to be a pouty,juvinile acting brat whom one doubts Jondalar would have ever actually had anything to do with. The meeting of ex-fiancee and Ayla is so predictable it took effort to get through it.Truth be told, the entire book took so much effort to get through that I skipped or skimmed large sections ... something this reader rarely ever does!The *best* thing about the former books was the intensely erotic love scenes. I once thought that Auel wrote better erotica than anyone else I'd ever read. Well, something happened between the last book and this one because even the cave-love has lost it's draw. While an intergral part of former stories, the erotic scenes in this installment seem almost an afterthought, as if Auel would rather be writing something else (such as another endlessly detailed description of the making of cave-objects, baskets, mats, clothing and the like)and inserted the love-scene only because she knew the readers expected it.About the endless descriptiveness, especially of early human culture: a bit of this is fine and added to the original book's appeal, but it almost seems as if \\"Shelters\\" was written so that Auel could exhibit her meticulous research and theories as to how life was lived then, as if the story was a mere frame for a display of the research, rather than the other way around. If I want to learn every detail of how to live like a cave-man, I'll take a survival course. I buy a novel to be entertained! Tell me a story!Even the animals, formerly the real charmers of the stories, succumbed to this book's long-windedness. Do we really have to be told *every* time Ayla goes to check on the horses? Do we really need repeated descriptions of how astounded people are when they first see tame animals? Do we really have to hear the story of how Ayla discovered domestication of animals as many times as this book subjects us to it? Even the attempt at tear-jerking fails; every crisis encountered in the book is resolved so anti-climactically we drop our hankies unused.The constant repition of a \\"poem\\" in the book (\\"The Earth Mother's Song\\")annoyed me to no end. Auel ought to leave poetry to people who know that craft, yet she is so infatuated with her own amateur-quality poem that she repeats it constantly and in fact even has a special repeat of it all by itself at the end of the book.Late in the book Ayla delivers her baby and promptly names her without stirring a single emotion. Nothing like the dramatic and soul-searing deliver of Durc, her half-Neanderthal son, in the hallowed 1st book, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\"Auel makes many references to the need to live in harmony with the environment throughout her entire series. She might've done the environment a favor and not written 700+ pages of pure drivel. If she wanted to bore us she could've done so in 300 pages or less. Or better yet, just issued a press release saying she didn't really know where to go with this story anymore, because it seems obvious that she doesn't. Yawn."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I ended up enjoying the \\"lectures\\" on botany, Stone Age hunting tools and methods, geology and geography more than the dialogue and didactic prose. Reviewers have hilariously pointed out how stilted the dialogue can be.I'm one of the compulsive \\"must have the whole series\\" fans who thus like the book more than I really ought to. However, wouldn't it have been nice if:a) Jondalar and Ayla actually have disappointing sex one night.b) Ayla actually makes a medical mistake!c) Ayla throws a temper tantrum or overwise displays some human moment of petty weakness like the rest of us lesser mortalsd) Wolf takes a dump in the cavee) Somebody thinks sure, Ayla is attractive, but just not his typef) Somebody besides Ayla actually invents somethingg) With all this racial diversity, how about somebody who is gay or lesbian? Imagine that--Ayla gets a gay pal or maybe falls for a hot girl, and poor Jondalar doesn't know whether to be excited or jealousI'm being tongue-in-cheek a bit, of course, but the writing did leave something to be desired. People are all two-dimensional characters, far more so than those of the Clan."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"My mom bought this book to read on a plane trip after reading the previous novels, and since I had also read them, she gave it to me after she was finished. Here for the first time I'm going to break one of my own personal rules and review a book that I didn't finish. I've read many hefty books with higher page counts in my time. Why didn't I finish Shelters of Stone? Because it's so drop dead boring, and because the main character's extreme Mary Sue-ish 'qualities' have really started to grate on my nerves.I enjoyed Clan of the Cave Bear the best, since then things have been all downhill. With this book, things have fallen very far indeed. As other reviews have mentioned, there's an unbearable amount of repetition, not just of previous volumes, but repetition within the book itself. I'd be fine with it if it only happened once and then was skipped or abridged in later explinations, but no... We have to suffer through the complete retelling of everything every time. How many times can a reader suffer through the discovery of firestones without slitting their wrists with one? Now we know.I gave up reading about halfway through, because nothing happened. And I mean really, nothing happened. Nada. Zip. They got to Jondalar's home. Everyone is over the fact that Ayla was raised by 'flatheads' in record time, wasting a plot point that had been built up in the last three books and turning it into a barely there afterthought. Anticlimactic is an understatement. Ayla gets introduced, gets tricked into wearing inappropriate clothing and there's a hunt. That's it. It took around 250 pages to get to this point. I've read better books that were over in fewer pages.Then there's Ayla. A good 95% of the characters in the book (I hesitate to say 'story' because there really isn't one) seems to exist just to remark on how amazing she is. Repeatedly. Everyone she meets just has to swoon and realize how she's wonderful and gorgeous and smart and gosh just isn't she so darn peachy keen? Except, of course, they're supposed to be a villain, and then they just hate her on sight for no reason. Maybe they have a point though, because I've started to actively dislike her myself. Ayla never does anything wrong. Never makes mistakes that cause problems, never suffers from jealousy, never wishes that the perpetrators of a cruel practical joke played on her would fall off a cliff, never feels overwhelmed at all the people she's suddenly having to face, and is just the bestest ever at everything she ever tries to do. She just prances around the tundra acting like some kind of prehistoric female Thomas Edison celebrity superstar, complete with adoring groupie squad.Speaking of the adoring groupie squad, what the heck happened to Jondalar? Over the course of three books he's gone from being at least an interesting (if overly angsty and guilt ridden) love interest to some kind of Ayla bodyguard/yes man/body temperature dildo. In fact, the only reason he's notable in this book is by his absence, mentally if not physically. The only time he has any input anymore is when it's in relation to Ayla. You'd think he'd be conflicted, or at least a little nervous about introducing a strange woman who's been raised by people that his relatives consider little better than animals, but no... He stumbles through SoS almost as an accessory to Ayla. The name Jonayla could almost fit Jondalar himself in this book.Do yourself a favor. Avoid this book unless what you're looking for is a cure for insomnia."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If all you want to do is find out what happened to Ayla and Jondalar next, then wait for the paperback or go to the library. I have seldom read a less satisfying book. I wasn't bothered by the recapitulation (it'd been 12 years after all) or the descriptions of the landscape and technology, which I have come to expect. The irritation starts with the stilted dialogue and the constant repetition of what Ayla knows that no one else does.Also, there are a number of clumsy moments in the book. Her second or third day she literally wanders from dwelling to dwelling looking for something to do.But what really galls is the complete lack of any dramatic tension, brought about by the endless introduction of plot lines that go nowhere. The Amazon summary mentions two: will Jondalar's mother accept her? Easily, it turns out. What about the jilted girlfriend? She plays one mean trick in the beginning and then completely disappears. Here were a couple of opportunities to make an interesting story, but they were squandered. There are more: the idea that maybe they should find out more about the Neanderthals, perhaps develop trade relationships because they possibly resent them for taking their land and might someday attack. Or the half flathead, a potential criminal sociopath if I've ever seen one. Ayla captivates and angers him, but his character remains undeveloped. Or Ayla's knowledge of birth control. At one point the tribe priestess is intensely interested in finding out more. But she never does. And finally, the bombshell that Ayla once gave birth to a half flathead herself. She hides this knowledge until the end. It's shared with only the priestess and there's no time left to develop this plot line either.Basically all Auel has done is set the stage for the next book. Her editor has let her and us down by not demanding the book Auel is capable of writing. If this were a first novel by an unknown, it would never have been published."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"My rating is actually 3.75 stars -- it's much better than three, but not quite four.Ms Auel has made no secret that she includes backstory in each of the succeeding novels in this series so that each book is accessible and comprehensible to new readers. It's a fine line between engaging the new reader while not boring the ever-patient Earth's Children junkie. While largely successful at this, Auel unfortunately crosses the line more often than she should. Too many passages, whether only phrases or entire sections, are lifted from the previous titles. There is also more internal repetition of events within \\"Shelters...\\" that sometimes makes the long-time reader feel bludgeoned by author's insecurity that we will forget earlier events.Except for the last few chapters, \\"Shelters...\\" is very much a revisiting of \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\", except without the jealous tension. It's a less stressful book to read (which isn't to say that it doesn't have its suspenseful moments). It's also a set-up book that has established a number of characters and motivations that will not be fully fleshed out or resolved until the next episode is written.A major aspect that finds me returning to this series is the number of emotionally powerful or memorable scenes to be found in each book. This fifth installment, unfortunately, came up a little short. While there are good scenes, this is the first of these books that didn't have any that sent me flipping back to re-read something that was amazing. In many ways it just felt like the author had lost some interest in the work and was just trying to fulfill the demands of her fans and publisher.Overall a fine effort, and I look forward to the last installment of this series (hopefully within my lifetime &lt;G>). While the wait was long, returning to visit old friends was very satisfying. My only hopes for the next novel are that Ms Auel find a better editor to manage the redundant information and presentation, and is better able to inject the degree of her own passion for the work into the story this is found in the earlier installments."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Because it's been so long since the last book, I read The Shelters of Stone with some curiosity. It didn't take me long to realize why the Earth's Children series has become beach/plane reading - not awful, just not compelling. Ironically, I find the protagonist, Ayla, the least interesting thing in the series - except as an example of how authors become overfond of certain characters.Ayla's the kind of character that I have come to find myself rooting AGAINST, even though it's a fixed game - the author clearly loves her creation so much that she can't bear to think of Ayla being insufficient in any way. She's so beautiful that every guy wants her. Every (Cro-Magnon) guy. Whenever you get the male viewpoint, it's never \\"Ayla was reasonably attractive, though Jarovar preferred smaller, brown-haired women.\\" No, she's always considered dazzlingly beautiful (Neanderthals aside).Not only is Ayla beautiful, but she's a supergenius. She has already invented or discovered the domestication of animals, the needle, the use of flint to start fires, the atlatl, the travois (I believe) and the role of men in human reproduction. Let's not forget that she's an incredibly talented healer, able to learn foreign languages in less than a month, and, I think, psychic. And she's a great orienteer - she's able to find a cave that has been overlooked by the people who live directly on the site.Does everyone love Ayla?, Well, yes, unless they're psychotic, insanely jealous jilted lovers, drunken bums or otherwise amidst the dregs of humanity. In fact, I can't even recall anyone who's lukewarm about her.But let's get to the plot of the book, such as it is. Here you are. 1) Ayla and her toolish mate Jondalar show up in Southern France. They sadly convey the news of Jondalar brother's death, which everyone seems to take pretty well. 2) Everyone meets Ayla and decides to adopt her almost immediately - except for Jondalar's bitchy ex-girlfriend and the local drunken bum, of course. Oh, there's also Jondalar's old rival and some part-Neaderthal guy who's not right in the head. They don't really like her either. 3) Ayla teaches everyone that \\"flatheads\\" are really nice, smart, spiritual people and that wolves aren't really scary. 4) Jondalar's other ex-girlfriend, Zeladoni, recognizes that Ayla is the smartest woman in the world and recruits her for the priesthood. 5) Ayla has her kid, named Jonayla.That's pretty much it. Ayla does get to see the Lascaux caves in their infancy. I'm just waiting for her to become the greatest artist the prehistoric world has ever known.As for the writing, Auel has become increasingly fond of mind-numbing repetition. EVERYONE who meets Ayla has to (mentally) remark upon her accent. EVERYONE thinks she doesn't look like all the other blondes in Southern France. Auel does treat us to many, many examples of what Ayla's accent sounds like (she rolls her rs.) There are also a few clinical sex scenes thrown in. None with the horses this time around, however.I gave this book three stars, because it's a perfectly adequate continuation of the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I purchased SoS I expected to sit down and read it through in a single sitting, dragging myself away for potty and food breaks. Instead it took me 3 days to read, and whenever I put it down for a break I had little interest in picking it up again right away.I am disappointed. It's not a bad book, but Ms Auel's earlier problems, going *too* far into the descriptions of everything, is magnified in SoS. There is just so much a person can take. She spends *pages* at a time just telling about simple things like how a valley is laid out in great detail. I found myself scanning until something happens again, skipping paragraphs and even pages. SoS is a 750 page book that should have been done in 400.My biggest complaint is the number of times she repeats herself in explaining the important points from the earlier books. For example: every time Ayla is asked about how she got the horses, Ms Auel repeats several paragraphs that could have been cut and paste. She could have simply written \\"Ayla sighed and retold the story again\\" and spared the readers.OK, I admit I love reading again about Ayla and Jondalar. The only thing that kept me reading was that it *was* Ayla and Jondalar. There are still good, and even great points to SoS. I was happy to see less of her trademark descriptive sex and more emotional relationships. Zelandoni is a truely great character and the newly introduced cast of the Zelandonii are convincing as people.When the storyline does finally emerge from the endless descriptives it seems that rather than a story in itself, Shelters of Stone ties up a few loose threads from Plains of Passage and sets up Book 6. This isn't much of a suprise, since Ms Auel has been writing Book 6 at the same time she wrote SoS.When Book 6 is finally written, I hope that since Ms Auel has pretty much described everything within miles of the 9th Cave of the Zelandonii that she will relax and stop repeating herself. It seems she has set up Book 6 to be an excellent climax to the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've never trashed a book like this, especially when I had been such a devout follower of the \\"Earth Children\\" series. Unfortunately, I have to. This book is utterly boring and chock full of seemingly unending repetition. How many hundreds of times within a novel can an author rewrite a person introducing themselves to someone else and then explaining it again and again? The main character, Ayla comes across as an absolutely perfect being. Not only is she so beautiful that no one could compare to her, but she has no faults. She is perfect in everything she does no matter what it is. After a while, she comes across as the fully airbrushed Cosmo girl of the Cro-Magnon set. She might as well be played by Brittney Spears because there isn't much else left of Ayla now that she has \\"arrived\\" at the biggest cave in the neighborhood. Everyone fawns over her, stands in awe of her and while gushing over her no character seems to be able to refrain from inevitably loving her accent (which we are endlessly reminded that she has)! In the one instance a character comes along and embarrassess her, that character is banished for hundreds of pages. The minutiae of detail is mind numbing and there is literally no action for chapters on end other than people walking around, walking to another cave, sitting around talking or walking and talking. Jondalar makes occasional appearances to grin at her suggestively, have sex with her (which is the same old stuff you get in any boring cheap novel) and as her (surprise!) absolutely perfect mate, knaps a few tools, throws a spear or two, and walks around with everyone else.Don't bother with this one. You can read the first couple of chapters, skip to the last couple and you really, truly, won't have missed anything else. Read \\"The Valley of Horses\\" instead for what Auel has lost in this really bad set of notes in disguise as a book. Want a good read in Sci Fi? Read Dan Simmons' ILIUM-Now THAT will give you a mountain of good summer reading!!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is the fastest ticket to snooze land ever written. Both my wife and I enjoyed thd previous books in the series; but the shere inanity of this volume has us baffled.It has no redeeming story, action and if filled with TONS of repetitive material, a juvenile plot that in essence makes a complete mockery of the major protagonists. Its plot devices, internal dialogue (writing, speech and grammar) are childish and uninspired. It appears to be a book more geared to young teen girls who envision Ayla (and themselves) as the ultimate uber woman who siglehandedly is resposible for all of the social and techonological development of humanity. Not only is this absurdity compounded by making Ayla into such two dimensional cliche; but by totally destroying any sense of character development, a sense of struggle and Ayla's humanity that marked they earlier books in the series. ...Bottom line: No Action, No Plot, Poor writing, and a 80% rehash of \\"vingettes\\" from previous events in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"One cliche that's drilled into students of creative writing (besides \\"write what you know\\") is \\"show, don't tell\\".Auel needs to go back to creative writing class.I lost count of the number of paragraphs that started with various takes on \\"X thought about what had happened\\" and proceeded to dissect the ho-hum minutiae of a very transparent situation for those who might have been too intellectually challenged to observe the basics of human interaction for themselves. Furthermore, after five books, our precious Ayla has yet to develop any realistic character flaws. This particular installment dwells on her perfection in nauseating abundance, as everyone around her (even the occasional unconvincing \\"enemy\\") repeatedly remarks on what a wonderful specimen of humanity she is.Very little of dramatic interest occurs in the plotline, and the anthropological, archaeological, and naturalistic details whose gleaning made the other books in the series decently worthwhile reads are few and far between.Others here have already mentioned the repetitiveness, so I won't elaborate on that here. But when even the \\"juicy bits\\" make you yawn, you know there's something wrong.This was one book I was VERY glad to leave behind me when I was travelling: far too big for its own good."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What a let down!! After waiting over a decade, THIS is all that Jean Auel could think up?? The book should have been called \\"How to stretch a 300 page book to 700 pages.\\" This book is terrible. After leaving us hanging in the last book with Ayla's first glimpse of Jondalar's home and her sense of deja vu, Ms. Auel does nothing more than go through the day to day drivel of life with the Zelandonii. It seemed like every other page contained either 1) a description of the entire world, 2) yet another comparison of Jondalar's eyes and a glacier, 3) another long explaination of permafrost or 4) an even longer explaination of working hides into leather.This book had no real plot and certainly no action. When I was in school, we were taught that a story should have an introduction, then a build-up to a climax between the protagonist and antagonist, then a conclusion. This book has only the first part. If Ms. Auel was wanting only to write a prelude to another book, she succeeded. Whether or not anyone who has read this book will sit through the next one, who knows.I know that these reviews are supposed to be about the content of the book, but, I don't think the guidelines are capable of handling a book with no content. The book is basically a year in the life of Ayla and Jondalar while living with Jondalar's people. The characters are not developed, Ayla is a wimp and Jondalar is so 2 dimensional he would be unable to stand in the real world. I've said it once already, but I have to say it again. This book was terrible! It took me almost 2 weeks to struggle through it and I kept thinking that it would get better. It never did. I usually read 2-3 books a week while working full time. I have read and liked books that most of my friends and my husband hated. I read books like other people watch TV, for pure entertainment value. If I cannot find a redeeming quality in a book, it doesn't have one (kindling and paper weights excluded). If you haven't read this book, DON'T. Wait for the next one. You will not have missed a thing. In fact, if you read this book instead of doing other things you like to do, you will be doing yourself a great disservice. Did I mention the fact that this book was TERRIBLE?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After a long wait, Shelters of Stone is a disappointment. I wait and wait for a plot to develop, but most of the words involve Jondalar's throbbing manhood (O spare me), Ayla's oral fixation on the said manhood, lengthy geological lectures, rambling landscape narratives, the same-old-same-old surprises that surprise everyone who meets this surprising woman, the repetition of facts (as if either the author forgot she mentioned things two pages earlier, or she believes the reader has forgotten), those rotten spear throwers appearing fifteen times (with people always being surprised), Ayla developing society and modern technology single-handedly (in the next volume does she invent Glad Wrap and the TCP-IP protocol?), and the poor Wolf and horses who (of course) surprise people and fill them with wonder every time they appear. Really, Jean: is there anything in this fat tome that has not already appeared a dozen times in the previous volumes?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have waited, along with many people, for Jean Auels' book for over a decade. Was it worth waiting for ?YES... Only if you have read the others. NO... If you are going to read as a one off. The story is very slow, very repetitive, it promises a lot and delivers very little. You spend most of the book awaiting the \\"Summer Meeting\\" where Ayla and Jondalar are to be mated. This in itself is a let down. More should have been made of the tension Ayla causes between herself and the likes of Brukenval and Marona. There were far too may repetitions throughout this mammoth book. Do we really need to have eveyone's extended name virtually each time they are introduced. After a few times, we know who \\"The First\\" is so Zolena would have been sufficient. The book would have been at least 100 pages shorter without all the repetitions.I only hope that when the final book comes out that we have more that keeps our interest, more of the conflict between the Clan and the Others.Buy if you are a fan, avoid if you are not. Sorry Jean, but PLEASE don't make us wait another 12 years for the next book, or if you do, make it better than this."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I assigned a rating of 2 stars for these reasons: One star for the quality of this work and one added purely out of affection for Ayla.I do not begrudge Mrs. Auel her admitted (in a recent interview I read) 12 year vacation which allowed her to enjoy the fruits of her labor with her husband and family; however, I think she insults the fans who provided such bounty with a poor offering like Shelters of Stone.I, and other fans I've spoken with, feel....well..., betrayed by the eagerly (and soooo patiently) anticipated Book Five...the tiresome repetitions, even repetition of events occuring in the current novel, that Mrs. Auel appears to use as filler to make the book look tantalizingly lengthy; however, I was tempted to refer back to passages, literally to check to see if she merely cut and pasted verbiage at (what she thought might be) opportune places.I understand the need to elegantly refer to past events in order to catch a new reader up to speed; however, \\"elegance\\" was not Auel's style....I felt more bludgeoned over the head, rather than nudged to a gentle remembrance. And the lengthy formal intros....puh-leese! Explain the tradition, give an example, then just say \\"formal introductions were made\\".All in all, the book felt like it took a supreme effort on Auel's part merely to cobble enough words together to create the impression that this is a tome worthy of a 12 year wait.As an original and loyal fan who did much to line Mrs. Auel's pockets by enthusiastically having recommended (and purchased as gifts) her Earth's Children series to friends and family, I feel betrayed (yes, I realize that I'm repeating myself, but turn about is fair play). And, hey, if *I* had written a series that turned me into a multi-millionaire, perhaps I'd have a similar laissez faire, disdainful, what-the-hell-they'll-buy-ANYTHING-I-throw-at-'em-now, attitude as well. And the pity of THAT is....she's right. I'll buy the 6th and final book in the series, in order to obtain closure, if for no other reason.

And the same goes for the others in the series (especially \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\") which were all really great. I will not be rereading \\"Shelters,\\" I'm sorry to say. I got the impression that the whole story, inflated to over 700 pages, could have easily fit in the first 100 pages of the next book. All the conflict built up to in the last few books - especially the very big question of the Zelandonii's acceptance of Ayla and her Clan background and son - were dismissed entirely. Oops, I guess Jondalar didn't have reason to be worried after all. Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people's reaction.

Ayla, Jondalar, Wolf, Whinny and Racer have finally made it across the continent to the homeland of the Zelandoni. I only suggest reading this book if you are a diehard Ayla fan like I am or if you have never read any of the other Earth's Children books.Being a long time fan of the series, it was only my love for the wonderful heroine that made me actually finish this book through. The little development in the two main characters was very disappointing. Probably the best character was the First Among Those Who Serve the Mother. However, it becomes obvious the further you read that Auel is only setting the stage for what will be her next book in the series. In my opinion that wasn't very fair to this book, but it definitely leaves your mouth watering for more.If you think you can handle repeat explanations of things that have happened in other books, you should be fine. But I seriously couldn't handle hearing about how Wolf was raised with the children of the Lion Camp over and over and over. And enough with the Mother's Song! Three times is more than sufficient... and it's even written in the back of the book too. There WILL definately be times where you'll groan, roll your eyes and skip a few paragraphs. However, it is the repeating of past events that makes this book easy to read for those new Earth's Children. You don't have to read all the other books to understand what's going on. If anything, it will make you want to go back and read them to know more about what had happened to the mysterious and beautiful woman, Ayla. You will learn to love her as so many already do.I suggest you buy the first three of the series instead. Books four and five are just missing something...

Nothing really compelling here. It feels like an in-between story, a filler, except it's 700 pages long! Unlike the previous books, which would keep me up till the wee hours (even with a full days work the next day) immersed in another place, another time, this one can be read with one eye on the TV and you won't miss much.It's too bad because so many of us have anticipated this book with good feelings for so long and would have been generous in our reviews had we been given a little more than the bone thrown at us."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited twelve years for this!? Ah, well, I suppose it's my own fault for looking forward to this book so much; maybe I was bound to be let down. At any rate, I can't imagine this latest installment attracting any new fans for the series. There is a boring lack of tension, conflict, and excitement throughout the book, which is partly what made the first four books in the series such enjoyable reads. Personally, I'm tired of Ayla and Jondalar being so perfect ALL the time -- don't they ever miss when they go hunting? Doesn't she ever have a bad hair day? Don't either of them ever think sex was \\"just OK\\"? Does Ayla ever wish for something that she doesn't get? Also, there were some things that just rang untrue in The Shelters of Stone; for example, when Jondalar arrives home after being gone for five years, you'd think his mother's second comment, after \\"Welcome back,\\" would be \\"Where's your brother?\\" But, no, apparently it doesn't occur to her to wonder about her other son for quite a long time after Jondalar & Ayla's arrival. Do you know ANY mother who would act that way? This book basically seems to be a bridge between the previous ones and the next one, whenever that will be.

I found myself skipping several pages at a time because I was tired of reading the same thing repeatedly. It seems as if Ms. Auel has forgotten how to fill out the people in her books and make them seem real as she has in past books. With her previous books I could not put them down until I had finished them, not even to sleep, but with this book I found myself forcing myself just to read a few pages at a time, I just kept thinking it has to get better, but it didn't.

I admired Ayla for her independence and courage, and Auel for creating such a vivid character. However with each following book I read Ayla became more plain and less interesting along with the general quality of each novel. As for the rest of the characters...Ayla's mate Jondalar is no more than a one dimensional sex object and not much more can be said for the other characters. The majority of them are just bland copies of characters in Auel's other novels (ex. Broud to Brukeval, Frebbec to Laramar, etc etc). No character stands out a real living, breathing human being.As for the plot... there is none. The majority of the 700-some page book is spent up in descriptions of animals or rock formations, the same sex scenes over and over again, Ayla reminiscing, or the god-awful Mother Song that appeared every twenty pages.Auel has definitely lost fans with this book. With any hope she'll be able to make up for it in the next book of her series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've spent the past week reading nearly 700 Amazon reviews of this book. The reviews are more entertaining than the novel! Most are hysterically funny, witty and sarcastic. They are also hard-hitting and get right to the point. I wonder if Jean Auel has read them?Incidently, I just saw an online photo of Jean supposedly taken in 2002 and she looks NOTHING like she does on the back cover flap of \\"Shelters of Stone.\\" No resemblance whatsoever.The biggest problem with Ayla is--she's too perfect. And Jondular has turned into a dumb hunk with nothing to say. I laughed at Ayla's intuitive understanding of alcoholism--I almost expected her to start a 12-step AA program for her white trash neighbor!But then again, Ayla is a super-woman who knows everything.If \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is made into a movie, Britney Spears should play Ayla! Daryl Hannah is too old now. This book definitely marks the \\"dumbing down\\" of the Earth's Children series.Reviewers have ridiculed Ayla for inventing modern civilization, but hey....someone had to create herbal tea, birth control, mouthwash and tampons!Jean Auel is no longer pretending to be a serious novelist. Ayla has become a gorgeous New Age prehistoric goddess.Regarding the sex scenes--we already knew that Jondular has a big...umm...\\"manhood.\\" Mrs. Auel describes their sexual antics in gynecological terms and that's a turn-off. Actually, their sex life has become boring and routine.And Marthona--Jondular's perfect mother--keeps her dishes and herbs on SHELVES in her stone-age kitchen. Imagine that!

She'll write down lenghty flashbacks of events that happened a 100 pages before. Added to that, she keeps on using flashbacks of the other books as well.It's insultive and incredibly repetitive. And I'm not going to forgive her for that, since it's quite obvious that she either thinks we are all imbeciles who can't remember any info for more then a few minutes, OR it's a page-filler trick, which might be even worse.I LOVED the first book, liked the second, minus the Jondalar bits which I really disliked, liked the 3rd a bit less, started to very much dislike the by then stale storylines in 4, and have now lost all respect for Ms. Auel as a writer.I don't really buy all that stuff about her doing so much research in France etc either, sounds more like a paid holiday to me. Much of the info she could have just pieced together by reading just a few history-books on that period.What a shame. I loved Ayla so much. Now she's just some horribly obnoxious blonde cave-barbie without any depth, no matter how much the whole 'spiritual side' of her is being shoved down our throaths.And don't even get me started on the creepy Jondalar with his apperently huge 'manhood', and his affections towards young virgins who he just LOVES to guide into womanhood with his extremely large extension of himself... *cough*All under the noble disguise of selfishly letting them know what pleasure is all about, of course.

There was far too much emphasis on the Earth, and not nearly enough on the Children.First, the major events of this book are almost skipped over to get to more description of the local landscape. I would like to have had more heartfelt descriptions of the adoption ceremony, the matrimonial and the birth of the child. I felt like they were just added as plot points, rather than major events.Secondly, I agree with many of the other reviewers that the constant greeting and naming of ties is tiresome and overdone. Occasionally it was glossed over with a \\"so-and-so named their major ties,\\" but I suspect that most of it was added as filler, to get the page count up. Wouldn't be an Earth's Children novel at 400 pages.Finally, the repetition of past events. Good grief, if someone hasn't read the other books, too bad! They should! The old books are far better than this one! A few sentences of remembering I can forgive, but the constant reiteration was really poor storytelling (or editing, or whatever). If Mz. Auel was concerned people woulnd't be able to follow the plot, they should have reissued the previous books. Oh, wait, they did. Then I must assume that like the name and ties, the backstory retelling was done to pump up the page count, and the price.This chapter of Ayla's story is obviously a bridge to the sixth and final work, which will no doubt deal with Ayla's zelandoni training. I recognize a transition book when I see one. But this book should have had about half the page count, and perhaps dealt with the important events of the homecoming of Jonde and the assimilation of Ayla rather than simply treating the plot as a vehicle for the description of the terrain."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"First I want to establish my \\"credentials.\\" Of my favorite books in the world, Jean Auel's Earth's Children series make up the first four.

I have owned many copies of the series and they have all fallen apart from rereading. They were a major formative force in my life, leading me to study archaeology and ancient art in college. I waited eleven years for this book!It is difficult to say anything that has not already been covered by other reviewers, but I will try. The good first ... it is an absolute joy to read about Ayla and Jondalar again :^)) It's like catching up with old friends, camping with them for a weekend. I also enjoyed the fact I am familiar with the area where all of this took place, along the Dordogne River of France. I guess I could say that if you had never read anything else by Jean Auel you could still read this book and follow the \\"plot.\\"But you see, that is the problem. Any attempt at a plot is submerged beneath the recaps of the material from the previous books, word for word, in italics. Nothing is left to the imagination nor the memory. The scenes tend to be repeated more than once, like the scene with Creb in the cave of the Mog-urs; that scene is repeated no less than four times. Repetition is the name of the game here, with Ayla's names and ties repeated each time she meets someone new. There are several hundred people for her to meet (all with names like pharmaceutical products) and her full name is repeated to each one. Also, each and every one is afraid of Wolf and the exact same procedure of hand sniffing and petting is demonstrated for EACH ONE. They accept the horses pretty easily, frankly. I have horses and I know a lot of people who are more afraid of horses than just about any one of the Zelandonii. Another gripe, the religion plays a huge part, but in a very dogmatic way. This, I must admit, may be a very very subtle foreshadowing for the next book, but if it is it is a way more subtle touch than JA usually uses, even at her best. (More a Robin Hobb subtlety.) The style seems stilted and awkward as well, telling rather than showing. If you read the book, the more shame on you, you will see what I mean.I think that the person reading this review may feel that I am nitpicking and not including anything about the plot. Quite simply, there is no plot. There are some things that happen (Ayla mates Jondalar, they have a baby, so does Whinney) but not enough to constitute a story. The best part of the book is the last fifty pages, with the plot finally taking off ... in the last paragraph. No kidding. There is no story here, just a series of recaps of the first four books, although rather twisted and changed to fit THIS setting. Also, there is a lot of description of the area which she obviously knows well; in fact, she tries to give a guidebook to the area without giving exact names. Now honestly, none of us are likely to hike up the Dordogne, so the extensive travelogue is not helpful. One more substitute for plot is the really heavy \\"mother\\" religion, which revolves around a very long creation song that gets repeated at full length twice, and parts of it about ten times, as though it held some great truth.The last big problem, and it is a huge one, is that the Zelandonii accept her flathead background with scarcely a ripple. Even when she tells them about her other child, they don't say a thing. This is my biggest problem because it was reinforced from the start of the Valley of Horses that the Zelandonii are racially intolerant to an extreme degree.This book could have been better very easily. It could have been another 300-700 pages longer. It could have have a plot involving the flatheads. It could have had more \\"inventions,\\" like the other four books. And last, but certainly not least, it could have had better sex. Each and every one was boring and just like the one before. Someone described them as \\"copy and paste\\" -- a very good summation of the feel of the love scenes. ...If you really want to know what happens, wait for the paperback. If you are looking for a really good read, try anything by Robin Hobb, in particular Fool's Errand, or Faith of the Fallen by Terry Goodkind. They evidence the subtlety and dynamism so sadly lacking in this woefully boring book. I gave it two stars for the sake of how much I still love the other four books in the Earth's Children series, otherwise it is a one star book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read this when it first came out in '02. And only today did I come to Amazon and skim the abundance of nasty reviews that this dud has inspired.So I know that everybody gets it, and there's no need to say more.But I gotta.Ayla meets and greets and greets and greets...and greets and greets and greets.... an incredible abundance of the most shallow characters you've read about so far.When she's not inventing everything, or humping, or drowning in tea, she finds time within these monotonous pages to have a mating ceremony, and a baby with Jondalar, the Wonder-Wimp. Oh, and she does decide to join Those that Serve the Mother.The end.That's it.And, yeah- those are the spoilers. I wish that I were here to tell you that a character named Brukeval threw in some incredible plot twists, or that an encounter happened between the Clan and Others, or something. ANYTHING. But except for repetition ad nauseam, nothing happens in this dud.I'm not coming back to the book stores in 12 years to learn that Ayla becomes first of Those That Serve; that Jondalar does nothing... ever- except smile with his \\"impossibly blue eyes\\"; that the poor kid with the unfortunate name of Jonayla spits up, drinks tea, and worships mom; and that they hump a lot.I'm done. I'm so turned off. Ayla, the Clan, and their remarkable human spirit will always live in that first book for me."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was a long time fan of the Earth's Children series and couldn't wait for Shelters of Stone came out. Over the years, I had read and reread all of the previous books over and over (I listened to them on unabridged cassette tapes and then Audio CD's).On CDs, there were times were the books were kind of tedious because of the repetitions - much like hearing a record get stuck. But, the storylines were entertaining.Listening to Shelters of Stone was almost painful. I actually was not able to finish it. I think I made it through about 4 of the CDs and gave up. The recaps just irritated me too much - I was really hoping that there wouldn't be all of the repetition and was disappointed to find it was worse then the other books. I have always enjoyed listening to these books but this time, the reader used an accent for Ayla (you know how she speaks with a funny accent? Not unpleasant, just different?) Well on the CD this time, she had a very pronounced accent that was so distracting it really just made things worse.I think perhaps the Jean Auel should take a lesson from J.K. Rowling of the Harry Potter series. There have been 6 books published and there is very little if any repetition.It is like these books are being written for the people who have never read a single volume in the series rather then for people who have read some of the books over and over. It might be better to have a preface at the beginning of the book for first timers to the series to explain that Ayla was raised by the clan, lived in a valley, discovered fire and found Whinney, met Jondalar, made spear throwers, traveled to the Mammoth hunters camp, found wolf and then traveled back to Jondalar's home. That way it would only be mentioned once in the book instead of over and over.I would like to try to read Shelters of Stone again someday - perhaps when the next book comes out, I will catch it in recaps?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Since I've read all of Auel's books back to back this winter, I did find this novel rather repetitive ~~ I already know what has happened to Ayla in the past ~~ and I was rather disappointed that this book wasn't flushed out like her other novels. I love reading about Ayla and Jondular ~~ I love reading about the craftwork, the hunting, and how they survive in prehistoric times but there wasn't much new in this novel and she left it hanging ~~ so I am assuming that there will be a sixth book in the series.If you're interested in prehistoric times, start with the Clan of the Cave Bear, The Valley of Horses, and Mammoth Hunters ~~ they are the best novels in the series. Also, they're not so focused on the sexual aspect of Ayla's life, like her two last novels (including this one).

When I started reading the series I was completely hooked. I've read and re-read all four books and they are wonderful, imaginative and flat out good stories.Shelters of Stone was like expecting a big thick slice of rich chocolate cake and being served a whole wheat cracker. All I could think was \\"It took over 11 years to come out with THIS?\\" Quite simply, it was boring. I agree with others on how repetitive the book was. It was just not up to par with the others. Or even close.I bought this book in hardcover because I assumed I would love it and want to read it numerous times. With book 6 (if there ever is one), I will wait for the paperback. Or better yet, pick it up from the local library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved the first four books, but doesn't everyone agree that Auel has run out of ideas for the series? I mean, the first four books have a focus, but now it's like, \\"Okay...we travelled for a year...we're here...now what?\\".I have just started this book and I feel disgusted already. How many times do we have to hear about how great Ayla is? She just basically shows off the same skills that she learned in the past few books, with nothing much happening so far, although I am already on page 269. Am I the only one {upset} about Ayla's perfection? She has absolutely no faults, which is insanely unrealistic. And the wolf...the wolf!But my favourite part is how this book is just an advocation of feminism and political correctness---note how easily the ancient people accepted Ayla's background? How could the people be open-minded so quickly, especially since they are so closed off from the neanderthals? That's like as if someone these days would start saying that gorillas were really people. I mean, come on."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wasted my time. There were so many chances for drama that were missed, so many segments that did nothing to advance the story. What little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is wasn't even action! It seemed to me this book was just a comercial for the next book. The first 4 books are well worth a second read, but this one should be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...this is a book about nothing. Ms. Auel really phoned this one in, and I couldn't be more disappointed. My advice, if you haven't started the series, is to read the first three, skip four and five, and hope six lives up to the first half of the series. Unless you want a slightly less boring version of a research paper on the topography of Europe 30,000 years ago, stay away. I think it took her twelve years because she kept dozing off.... I NEVER have written a comment on a book before. The only reason I felt compelled to do so now is, after all the anticipation, I feel cheated and let down. Of course, who cares, because of course I'll buy the sixth one too, just to see if things look up. Still, I think I'll wait till it gets to the 2nd-hand store next time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed every one of Jean Auel's books until now. This book was all set up and NO plot. Even though some possible action was hinted at throughout the book, NOTHING happened. Hint for her next book: use Auel's detail of prehistoric life and character set-up, then hire a ghost writer to weave a PLOT into the book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The first book in this series, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", was a classic, one of my favorite books of all time. Each book in the series has failed to live up to the preceding book, but up until this one, they were all still excellent. This one is a pleasant read for a fan of the series; it's like a visit with family. It's good to see more of Ayla and Jondalar, but not overly exciting. And it doesn't help that there was an ELEVEN YEAR hiatus between the previous book and this one, producing the reaction, \\"We waited eleven years for THIS?\\"It's tempting to say that nothing happens in this book, but that wouldn't be accurate. Not even that nothing important happens. After all, Ayla and Jondalar get married, and have a child, and Ayla is accepted by Jondalar's people, and decides to become a shaman. All of these things are important events, not only to the people involved, but to the plotline of the series. But it WOULD be very close to accurate to say that nothing EXCITING happens in this book.In the first book of the series, Ayla survives an earthquake as a five-year old, survives wandering alone for days, survives being attacked by a cave lion, learns to live with a completely alien group of people, teaches herself to hunt, to survive on her own, and to swim, and is taught how to be a healer. She saves lives, challenges tradition, and faces down her enemy in a gripping scene at the end of the book.In the second book in the series, she survives for years on her own, learns to make fire with flint, tames a horse and a cave lion, saves the life of her soul mate, falls in love, relearns how to speak verbally, and invents a new hunting tool (with a little help from Jondalar.) (And learns that sex can be fun.) Meanwhile, Jondalar is surviving a cross-continent journey with his brother, experiencing many narrow escapes and new things, loses his brother and almost dies.The third book sees her tame a wolf, and sees the relationship between her and Jondalar tested; she meets new people for the first time, and learns to deal with difficult ones.The fourth book sees the two of them survive an encounter with a madwoman with political power, and set to rights the culture that that woman had warped to her own liking, and help a neanderthal couple defend themselves from a gang of young toughs.So what's the most exciting thing that happens in THIS book? The incident in which Ayla FAILS to heal someone too badly mauled to save? The healing of someone with a badly broken leg? Or the meeting of people who don't like her, and whom she's presumably eventually going to have to win over? None of these are gripping dramas, but they're the closest that this book has to offer. There just isn't enough plot here to justify the length of the book, or the length of time it took to write it. Which is a shame, because I love the series. I hope the sixth book (allegedly the final one) will see the action pick back up again."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As a fan of Jean Auel's earlier books, I have to add my vote of disappointment over this long-anticipated continuation of Ayla's story. The earlier books were enjoyable, even with, and partly because of, the detailed descriptions of prehistoric life. And, of course, Ayla as the primitive version of Thomas Edison has to be taken with a grain of salt.Unfortunately, in this book, that grain has been bulked up to a granite rock and has been shackled to her leg. Auel drags Ayla through a year in the life of Ayla and Jondalar as they return to his old neighborhood. To plagiarize an old concert review, the book ran through the entire gamut of human emotions, from A to B. Although the description of the mountains, rivers, grasses, deerhide, weaving, etc... was mildly interesting, (up to a point), it slowed the story line down from a pleasant walk to a zombie stagger.The repeated introductions, the endless reliance on the comings and goings of Wolf, Whinny and Racer as plot development, the numerous descriptions of every rock, cliff and riverbank, as if this was a traveler's guide instead of a novel, simply added to the lethargy. When dramatic tension is defined by a gashed leg to a young hunter, or the horrible dismay Ayla suffers at being shouted at, it's hard to force the hand to continue to turn the pages.I did finish the book - it was generally easy reading - but I did it more out of a sense of commitment rather than engagement. And I don't see how a reader who had not read any of the earlier books would get even that far."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I started reading the Earth's Children Series when I was in sixth grade. I am now twenty-five years old and I had given up on completely reading the series. In this span of time I have read and reread through the series. I love her books previous to Shelters Of Stone. She has always provided excellent plot, character development, excitement, and the tantalizing \\"just wait for the next book\\" endings. This, mixed with her amazing ability to convey the setting in a factual well-researched manner, has made me a devoted Auel fan.Over a decade I had spent reliving Ayla and Jondalar, in a limbo that I had thought would never end. Now it seems that I will continue to exist in this limbo. Jean Auel has forgotten her characters in exchange for more intimate detail of scenery, climate, and anthropology. I feel like I know these characters better than Auel does. This is not conceit, just plain commonsense. Ayla is a shadow of who she used to be. The animals are no longer character. Jondalar is just an ordinary man. I would like to ask Ms. Auel, \\"Where is Ayla? Does she exist in your mind anymore, or is there only rock?\\" Perhaps this seems harsh. Perhaps this could be a problem with the Publisher and Editors hounding Ms. Auel for her new book. It is easier to write a book about things than about people, especial the fictional. However, the book is not up to Auel's par. Regardless of the reason, or the quality of the settings, which are in full detail, the heart of The Earth's Children is not there."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I don't think that Jean Auel wrote this book. It was stunted and sounded like the person writing it had no idea how to use descriptive sentences and it repeated itself many times. Really, I got tired of hearing how Ayla was already noticing that she needed to 'make water' more frequently. And how often did we need to have the fact that Ayla spoke with a 'strange accent' shoved down our throats? How about all the Ayla looked to her right and and saw ______? Then she looked left and saw _____? She sipped her tea and looked at X and noticed _______? Ridiculously amateurish. I didn't mind having bits of the earlier books repeated a bit as it has been a while since reading them. I did get tired of the too long sex scenes, but that was something I disliked about the first books as well. I found myself skipping and skimming over whole pages in this book. Really, this was not the same author who wrote the other books, this had to be a ghost writer on their first book. I'm so glad I waited to check it out of the library instead of buying it. Thumbs down."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Oh Dear, I don't know about the rest of you readers, but this book stunned me with how bad it was. I have fond memories of reading clan as a 10 year old, but on re-reading that I have to say it now seemed flawed and unusually silly to me. The ludicrous perfection of Ayla's character is present even in the early novel, and I now find myself wondering how much of Shelters poor reception is due to its audience maturing and increasing in literary awareness over the long Aul-less years, and how much is due to the (undoubted) lower quality of the writing herein."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved Auel's other books. In fact I have read The Clan of the Cave Bear so many times that the cover has fallen off. Despite the fact that I was basically willing to love SoS no matter what happened in the story, Auel did the one and only thing that could have made me not like this book, she wrote badly. SoS was boring and very slow moving,with no real central story to keep the reader's attention. There are about 50 new characters, and none of them are interesting. Things that the reader already knows are repeated over and over again. Want a list? How Ayla grew up with the Clan, how Jondalar and Ayla met and how she healed him, how she found out about firestones, how they made a spear thrower, people's titles, and to top it all of a really long and boring Mother song. I counted four times Ayla told the story of how she came to have a horse. But I could have missed a time or two, I started skipping over the long descriptions around page 300. The worst thing of all is that Ayla and Jondalar have become, well, boring. They are apparently incapable of doing any wrong. They go from place to place spreading the inventions only they were smart enough to think of and showing people the errors of their ways. They are always described as the most beautiful couple and are the best at everything they do. I think that if I met a couple like them in the real world they would annoy me, not inspire me. But after all is said and I done I understand that if you have been waiting for this book as long as I was no review is going to stop you from reading it. But for your own good just trust me, save your money and wait for it in paperback. You waited years for this terrible book, another few months won't hurt."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting all these years to finally finish the story of Ayla and Jondalar, I am severely disappointed in the fifth book in the Earth's Children series.

That dreadful song/psalm/poem nearly killed me. I do hope that Ms. Auel will not feel she has to retell the major points of her previous five books when she writes the sixth installment of the series. This book was too long. \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is only 468 pages long and it is a great story. Instead of writing another epic 700+ page novel, maybe the next book will be a little less long-winded and a little quicker in coming, too.

Well, in the fifth I got to meat the family, go on a couple of hunts and go to a wedding, but not much more. After all of the adventure of the previous book, I expected at least the first preliminary encounters with the Clan and a hinting of future excitment/mystery with her Son (Durc). Without this, I can foresee the sixth book having a lot crammed into it, leaving the readers feeling short changed on the Action of the story line.However, it wasn't a total loss for I did get to spend a little more time with the characters that we have related to over the past four, 'great' books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like so many, I absolutely love these books. I've eagerly awaited this fifth installment for years. I was willing to wait, believing that it takes a long time to write books as sweeping in scope, yet packed with emotion and detail, as the Earth's Children books. Then, finally, there it was! Or was it? I found myself immediately concerned when the beginning was so stilted and dry. I tried to ignore it, though, because I so wanted the book to be awesome. But I kept turning pages, stunned, as event after event which should have been momentous was shrugged off and dismissed in a page or two. Did Ayla and Jondalar not go through hell throughout books two and three because Jondalar's people were not going to accept Ayla's Clan background and child without a bitter struggle? It felt like nobody even noticed! There was nothing but token struggle from people who already had axes to grind with Ayla and Jondalar for other reasons, who used it as a mere excuse. When our heroes were mated at last, in an anticlimactic ceremony that left me completely dry-eyed despite my best intentions to enjoy it no matter what, I stopped being shocked and became just plain angry. Ms. Auel, what happened? Given your past work, we know that you are capable of so much more than this. How is it possible that you have produced this dry, casual tossing away of a story line that has been building through four substantial books? I agree with all of the other reviewers. The book is terribly repetitive. I guess some things happen, but it FEELS like nothing happens. And the overall feeling I got was that you couldn't care less.

There was so little of the people of the Ninth Cave, I expected to be let into their hearths to see their impression of Ayla and her animals, new inovations, etc. Instead the only thing we find out is that every man is envious of Jondalar and every woman is envious of Ayla. (BIG SURPRISE) The most enjoyable part is finding out that there was Trailer Trash long before there were trailers. Wait for the paperback on this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After reading the previous novels many times over and now still trying to get through Shelters, I beleive there is a huge difference in Jean Auel's mental effort and her desire to share herself with her readers. In Valley of Horses, the character development was undeniable. Auel created a character that was just learning what it meant to be an adult and live on her own, shunned by those who she thought would always be there for her and chose to survive when it would have been easier to give up.What seems so stunningly different about Shelters is Auel has lost the desire to communicate human suffering and triumph which is what books 1-3 were mostly about and, I'm guessing, somewhat of what her own life must have been like. Only someone who has been through it could describe the emotions given to Ayla.Has Jean advanced in years to the point where it's not as interesting to shape a character and their emotional growth as life progresses?Jean, your earlier books were written with an understanding of the depth of human suffering that many people will never know and only those who've been through it can identify with. Where did that person go that wrote those earlier books?Ayla and Jondalar were both thrilling characters and very interesting to get to know. In Shelters, however, their relationship stalls as does all character development. Additionally, the story so far shows no signs of coming together. I got so desperate for a story that I read the end of the book to see if anything interesting was going to happen to make getting through the rest of it worthwhile.Jean, for the sixth and final book, please find the effort to write an amazing tale that leaves all of us wanting more...as all good books do."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Sadly, this much-anticipated sequel is a watered down version of Auel's incredible capacity. While it was gratifying finally to have more pieces to the story, one has to wonder if Jean Auel lost her heart and interest in the story during her twelve years of research and writing. She seems far more caught up in tedious replications of the wonders she feels she saw during her research journeys then she does in telling Ayla's story. The first time I read The Shelters of Stone I found myself floored at the changes in the flavor of the overall story as well as Ayla's character. Yes Ayla continues to portray herself as a medicine woman ... but her fans certainly did not get to see her in medical action the way we've come to expect. We continually receive hints that Marona will generate a big conflict, but nothing ever happens. Brukeval is nearly ready to come to blows with Ayla ... yet again, nothing ever happens. Neither does any of the suspense building from previous books for this portion of the series ever come to fruition. After hundreds of pages of the initial few weeks after Ayla and Jondalar arrive and go to the Summer Meeting, suddenly months go by in a short span and the book is over. Furthermore, while it's always been apparent that Auel has a real penchant for repeating certain information throughout her stories, she truly seems to carry it too far this time. Among other oft-repeated information, the Mother's Story was tiresome in its repetition. Before I made a final opinion, I read the previous four books again. I then reread The Shelters of Stone, only to indeed find myself dreadfully disappointed after all the anticipation. I fervently hope Jean Auel takes her readers opinions to heart, and displays the incredible capacity for spell-binding authorship her fans know her to be fully capable of when she regales us with the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Clan of the Cave Bear was required reading my sophomore year in high school.

Book four \\" The Plains of Passage\\" was too descriptive with not enough story. Also, it had too many detailed love scenes. Book five \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" started out a little better but then went back to being descriptive. I am completing the set of books but I have read much better books and I do not recommend them to anyone.Amazon Verified Purchase"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read all of the books in the series and enjoyed most of them. In this book the author copies and pastes huge portions of her earlier works. The exact words may not be used, but the concepts and themes are. As in her other works, she repeats various scenes/themes here, but takes it to a new level in this book. There is VERY little new material here, and the big \\"reveal\\" is just not very interesting. I regret spending the money to purchase this book. Please do not buy it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a die-hard Jean Auel fan, so I felt like I had to read this book. It was really interesting reading about Jondalar's people, but the problem was there was a lot of repitition from the previous books. I felt like I had to read about it all over again: the introduction of the spear thrower, the contraception tea, the flint stone for making fire, the horses, and the wolf. And of course how PERFECT Ayla is, I swear that girl never makes a mistake, whereas Jondalar is a little more believable. There was a lot less sex in this book, than in Plains of Passage, probably because the two main characters weren't alone as much this time around. Jean Auel has definately lost her edge a bit since The Clan of the Cave Bear. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of two, was because of how much I like this book series as a whole."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed reading Clan of the Cave Bear about 25 years ago. I've been enjoying the series again on audio. Everything went well until I reached this book, which picks up minutes after the 3rd book ended. Somehow in those few minutes, Ayla acquired a Transylvanian accent. Her voice has deepened and she sounds like Elvira. I'm not sure why this change in direction was chosen, but it is very annoying and off putting. I felt like I didn't know the character any longer. Only now, in the last chapter of this epic novel am I getting used to her new voice.I would have expected a speech impediment, maybe, but an accent? She came from people who didn't speak...where on earth would she have gained an accent, and why only add it now?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"So, you are all built up for Ayla to meet Jondalar's people and you just get this deflated storyline out of it all. As in previous books, I enjoyed meeting the new characters in this book, but most of them were so one-dimensional it was hard to fall in love with any of them.Zelandoni/Zolena is quite plump now and no longer attractive and is also the head of their religious women leaders, so no love triangle or heightened drama to that story.Jondalar's family is nice enough, but quite perfect and flat. Even the part where they are told about Thonolan's death seems to be over and done with quite quickly.There's Morona who Jondalar was possibly going to mate before he left on his journey, who plays a nasty trick on Ayla but then you don't hear much of her for the rest of the book.There are other characters but most of them are either totally sugary sweet or totally rotten that you can't seem to get interested in many of them.Totally annoying is how you have to hear for the upteenth time about Whinney, Racer and Wolf and how Ayla controls them and how she came upon them and also how you have to read for the upteenth time about how Ayla speaks with an accent.What was REALLY odd for me in this book was how the Zelandonii seem to be so accepting of Clan people. Sure some have a hatred for them and many seem to still view them as animals, but a couple half-clan people live with the Zelandonii and Dalanar's people and one even mates the daughter of Dalanar's hearth. For people who were supposedly going to be so against someone with a Clan background, there wasn't much drama or turmoil there at all when Ayla came onto the scene.Overall, this book could have been so much more than it was."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Since the opening pages of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" I've counted myself an Earth's Children fan. I loved the otherworldly yet very familiar landscape of the Russian steppes tens of thousands of years ago, and I loved the character of Ayla, a resilient girl with a large heart and a backbone of steel. I followed that adventure through \\"The Valley of Horses,\\" met Jondalar, and watched the blossoming sexuality of these characters--a bit explicit for young readers, to be sure. \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\" had moments of conflict and high adventure, and \\"The Plains of Passage,\\" while sometimes laborious, swept me away once again into this distant past. Even when other readers complained that things were getting too slow, too long, I stood strong in my support of the series.My strength has finally waned. \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is a huge disappointment. We spend the first 200 pages rehashing everything Ayla has done, all the things she has learned, and her abilities with her wolf and horse. These things could be skimmed over, since we've read about them ad nauseum in the other books, every time Ayla and Jondalar meet a stranger, meet a friend, an enemy. We've waited all these years for a sequel, and instead we get the expected flowering of Ayla into her medicinal abilities. We read 800 pages for very little change on any level. While I admire Auel's research, I wanted her to sweep us away with another grand story, not impress us with her encyclopedic knowledge of plants and terrain--yes, we've read it all before in her books and we're already impressed.With the announcement of the final book in this series, I got excited all over again. But, reading the reviews of \\"The Land of Painted Caves,\\" I suspect it's one more lengthy and boring wind-down of a series that started with such great energy. With all the money, all the time, and all the success, Jean Auel could've listened to the negative reviews and given us what we've wanted all along: a story, a wonderful, fun, gripping story. Instead, in book five, we get an exercise in research and tedium. Oh, please, give me shelter!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"So, there's another installment on the way this march? If ever there was a writer in need of a strong editor, Auel is that writer! She has put together a number of potentially good 400-450 page books; unfortunately, she has amassed 750-800 pages in writing each of them! That has not changed apparently as the new one is also 750 pages. There is evidence of considerable research all her books and that deserves credit, but much too much of it (waaaaay much too much of it) ends up in the narrative and serves no useful purpose beyond turning an nicely-tempoed read into a multi-paged slog; parts of every book are akin to running through foot-deep syrup.The other beguiling issue is her routinely silly treatment of the main character. I fully expect that by the midpoint of the upcoming installment Ayla will have invented neurosurgery, launched a satellite, cataloged the entire field of flora and fauna in yet-to-be-invented Latin, taught children rock, paper & scissors, and produced a passable sub-machine gun. Come on! The story potential is enormous; the overkill is unforgivable. The editor should be shot!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Every page of this Kindle book contains multiple errors: punctuation, formatting, spelling. It's distracting and very disappointing. I can't even enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I don't know why people are complaining about this book. Did the time lapse bewteen Ms. Auel's last book and this one cause some people to forget that prehistoric times were different from today's world?Yes, personal character introductions are repeated in this book. That's because in the prehistoric world there was no television, radio, or Internet to spread information about unknown individuals. Introductions were also used to show honor and respect. Ms. Auel, as an excellent writer, understands that she needs to realistically represent the patterns people followed when they introduced new people to one another. It's called storytelling.Certainly, the dialogue Ms. Auel writes may not be the snappy, clever or minimalistic Hemingway-type dialogue that is used in modern pop literature, but that's because she is not writing a Tom Wolfe or a James Patterson novel. She is writing to communicate the human-ness and ordinary-ness of prehistoric humans. That is her aim and her casual, refreshing character dialogue is the tool.Ms. Auel includes some flashbacks and rehashes of past events in her book. People are saying they don't like this. Why? The segues fit into the narrative perfectly, and help to add to the drama and power of the story. In real life, people think back over past events all the time. As a writer, Ms. Auel is once again reflecting reality. I suspect the complainers must be people who usually read minimalistic detective dramas or modern realistic fiction where not much internal work happens.People are griping about the fact that Ayla is \\"larger-than-life\\". Ummmm ... and the point is? Ayla is SUPPOSED to be larger-than-life! Much like a lead character in a graphic or epic novel, she is astounding to both the reader and the characters within the book. She is an archetype. She has always been an archetype. She is not one of those mundane, self-consciously \\"normal\\" characters people in MFA creative writing classes create. Ayla is the product of a REAL writer who knows how to create unusual characters that people literally love. Do you think people would have named their daughters Ayla had Ayla been one of those modern American Janet Evanovich characters? No, of course not.In addition, Ayla is one of those history-changing people that pop into existence now and then. People are whining because Ayla makes all sorts of new discoveries, like how to use rocks to make sparks, where babies come from, how to make a pole drag, etc. Well, people like that DO and HAVE existed. Look at Leonardo da Vinchi and Einstein for examples.I also don't understand why people are objecting to how Ms. Auel makes Ayla very beautiful and grants her a very charismatic personality in the book. Again, extremely beautiful women have existed in the past: ever heard the phrase, \\"The face that launched a thousand ships\\"? Charismatic women have existed as well: Joan of Arc, for one. And sometimes women have existed who were both supernaturally beautiful AND charismatic: consider Cleopatra as an example.Finally, people are saying they are unhappy with Ms. Auel's long descriptions in the book. The long descriptions are there because it is an EPIC tale and an EPIC book. Tolkien did the same thing and no one complains about him. Besides, Ms. Auel wants to impart some knowledge of prehistoric times to the reader and enhance the artistic level of the narrative in doing so. As Ms. Auel has said; \\"The magic is in the details.\\"This book is a worthy accomplishment of a top-notch writer and should be bought, savored, and reread. If you are brave enough to have an open mind, buy this book. If you just follow the pack and base your book purchases on what the masses are saying, well then, you will only be cheating yourself when you miss out on this wonderful, fascinating work by one of the world's greatest living authors."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The 700+ reviews were vastly more entertaining than the book itself, as well as showing a much better command of plot structure and characterization. ;) However, that's something you can read in the reviews themselves! I'm not going to rehash the problems with Shelters of Stone itself, because other reviewers have already done it very well. Instead, I want to explain why I gave this book two stars rather than somewhere around negative 10. This book does provide an outline of Stone Age Old European culture that is as accurate as possible, given all the new information and scholarship available from the last half of the twentieth century.In Stone Age cultures, hatred, violence, fighting, and prejudice certainly did exist (and Jean Auel does include them as well, as little as she does with them in her writing.) However, for nearly 40,000 years, human beings lived without warfare, without slavery, and without patriarchy (or matriarchy, for that matter!) I am constantly astonished by the degree to which this still seems to be such a well-kept secret as far as the general public is concerned. There are still people who think that Neanderthal cavemen ran around dragging women by the hair. BUT... and it's a big but... it certainly isn't the average reader's fault that they may not know this. You probably won't find out unless you take a decent anthropology (or possibly history) class at the college level. (It's all there in recent textbooks, however, such as Western Civilizations: Volume I, by Judith G. Coffin, Robert C. Stacey, Robert E. Lerner, and Standish Meacham, and Western Civilization: A Brief History, Comprehensive Volume, by Jackson J. Spielvogel. If you look at textbooks published before the late 1980's, though, the test isn't fair. James W. Loewen and Dr. Jack Weatherford have also done some significant scholarship in this area as a part of their larger work.)So THAT'S why the work of an author like Jean Auel is so important. But in a way, it's also why it's so maddening to read a book for which we waited so long, and received so little. I think that she has an OBLIGATION to edit her work a little more effectively than this, at the absolute least."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was very excited to see this book finally out and bought it immediately. I had become a fan after reading the first book and although some of the ones that followed were less well written I had great hopes for this one. I was disappointed. I kept waiting for something to happen that never did. No problems were overcome nor dangers survived. Boring. I got to the point where if I read one more line about how great Ayla is I thought I'd choke. About the best thing I can say is it's nice she finally has what she's always wanted. Perhaps the next and last book will be better but I'm not holding my breath."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Very long book, but worth the read. If you liked the others in the series, you must read this to find out what happens with Jondalar and Ayla and the baby. I love the information about pre-man in this series.

I did by accident and loved them."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have waited for a very long time for this book and when I finally read it I was very disappointed.

I absolutely loved the others in the series...lost major parts of entire days reading them non-stop, but this long awaited addition is nothing but repetitious drivel.

Nothing happens that I cared about at all."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Since my son bought me Plains of Passage for a birthday present (well maybe it was a Christmas present) I loved this series.

I best liked the detail she gave in the everydaylives of the Zelandonii, there reaction to the animals and the progress in the knowlege of how theanaimals could be usful. I think Auel did an excellent job in developing the storyline - how Aylaintergrating with the Zelandonii and also how the Zelandonii are coming to appreciate Ayla uniquequalities. I so much look forward to the next book and hope it doesn't take too long. I hope Auelwrites several more books to this series - going through Ayla entire lifespan and that of her children's -she give such great insight to what life would be like in the Pleistocene - the attention to detail andaccuracy is the series greatest strenght - perhaps one day the series will be turned into a movie(theather or for tv) with accuracy this time to what Auel has written."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Auel apparently grew bored and uninspired with her characters and story, because she literally cut and pasted pages and pages of descriptions and events from previous books into this book. The repeating of all names and ties and putting in lyrics to silly, long songs was not a creative way to take up space -- she should have made this book shorter. This effort was a major disappointment. The author gives the impression that this book was done purely for the profit margin, not the integrity of the story.As for the story line itself, it is ok -- but never finishes anything like the contest of wills between Ayla and Marona, or the drunk, or the 'mixed-spirits' guy...and that fact that Ayla is practically forced into their preisthood after repeatedly saying no, and in the past not liking the spiritual stuff, is really just stupid and out of character for her.While I hope it doesn't take 10 years for the last one, I won't be rushing to buy it in hardcover either."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I love the Earth's Children series but I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of the Kindle editions. Seems to me that there was little, if any, proofreading done before release. I have found numerous errors, the most annoying being the use of completely wrong words. These words are spelled correctly, which is why a spell-check would not have picked them up, but the word itself is not correct and makes no sense in the sentence in which it appears. Haphazard capitalization and strange hyphenations also exist (in this and the other books in the series).I love my Kindle but I wish that the ebooks were checked more carefully before Amazon releases them for purchase."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was a great let down. If you have read the 2nd - 4th books in the series then there is no need to purchase this one. I don't know what happend but Ms. Auel just regurgitated those books through out most of this book. It was sad that the story line which was hinted at in the last book is not fully explored in this book. What a waste of money, check it out of the library before you decide to spend some cold hard cash."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have waited a long time for this book. I loved her other EC books. This one is almost boring and repetative. When I am reading a page it feels like I just read the same page 10 pages ago. Or so much description is layed out for the scenery, the story seems lost. I think this book could have been written in half as many pages. I understand these places are real, but I almst feel like I am getting a geography lesson. I did enjoy knowing what happened to Ayla and Jondalar, but I did not not enjoy this book as much as the other EC books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I, like most of the posters here, really loved Jean Auel's earlier novels. Even the slower... ones like Valley of the Horses or the Mammoth Hunters had a regular plot and exciting passages, along side Auel's continous and constant pre-historic lore. (And I thought Plains of Passage was just downright thrilling)But the problem is that this book has almost no plot. Like many people noted the book is one big continous loop. Many of the conversations between the characters were better left up to the fan's imagination. (Such as the meeting between Ayla and Marona). Even Ayla, at some point in the novel notes a repetion from a previous novel (\\"Are we going to have to give him a firestore like Frebec?\\").One would have liked to see more conflict. It didn't have to be this bland.There is one good thing about this novel is that it seems to be setting up (one would hope) a more exciting sequel, and Auel has promised that it will come out relatively soon."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"We waited 12 years for this? It's not \\"plodding\\" like Plains of Passage, but with a few exceptions, not exciting at all - totally predictable. I had high hopes early in the book, especially when Marona pulled her little trick, but after that, things just settled back down again and never seemed to pick up - I didn't even get worked up when Ayla had the baby. In my opinion, 12 years without a major novel has dulled Jean Auels' edge - that's the only explanation I can come up with (but her research is still meticulous). There were plently of opportunities to get our blood pumping, but nothing developed from those opportunities. I could give an outline of the whole story in one page - and any devoted \\"Clan\\" fan could fill in the blanks. Sorry Jean - I love the series, but am disappointed with this book, especially after waiting so long. Sure hope you're planning some fireworks for #6!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I absolutely agree with the other reviewers - this book was too repetitious and did not have the rich plot development I had hoped to find. I don't know about the other readers, but I sure did not need a full recap of the other books. She even italicized up to a page at a time with copy/paste passages from previous books. There were also repeated passages from THIS book throughout the book. I think I can remember what happened 20 pages ago! The introductions were getting very annoying. I was disappointed with the attention she paid to all these things and just skimmed over Thonolan's spirit search, Ayla's adoption ceremony into the Zelandonii, the matrimonial ceremony, the birth of hers and Winney's babies. I would have liked to see more attention paid to these things rather than having to re-read the Mother's song for the umpteenth time! I'm really hoping for a better book (6) to end the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As epic and as captivating as the previous books in the \\"Earth Children's Series\\" were, it's hard to believe that Jean Auel could so utterly miss the mark in this long, boring, and painfully uninspired installment. When most of your time is spent referencing an appendix at the back of the book to keep the 80+ characters straight in your head, when you close the book thinking it could've been a good 400 pages shorter without editing out any of the genuinely good writing, and when you ultimately walk away thinking to yourself, \\"I waited 12 years for THIS?\\" you're bound to be disappointed.If well-written epic women's fiction is what interests you most, then do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Before you're brainwashed into thinking THE SHELTERS OF STONE is anything beyond a colordul doorstop, pick up some backlist Jean Auel, the Diana Gabaldon \\"Outlander\\" books, or anything by Dorothy Dunnett to remind yourself what good writing really is."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...The writing style in Plains of Passage and, now, in The Shelters of Stone, has become repetitive and tedious. Ms. Auel's first three books were great reading--good storylines that kept the reader's attention. The last two books have taken on a decidedly different writing tone. Plains of Passage and Shelters of the Stone could have been condensed into one good book instead of two mediocre ones."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I heard that this book was coming out after twelve years, I literally jumped around the room with glee.I was very happy to be reading this book, however much of the content concentrated on death and funerals. While these burials were very interesting, I got a tad morose after awhile with all the sadness.I also had a hard time dealing with all the bureaucracy in the book. I don't really understand how the pre-neolithic folks in southeastern France lived because Ayla spent a lot of time with the powers that be. The zelandonia (holy group) weren't nearly as approachable and \\"good\\" as Mamut from The Mammoth Hunters or the other Holy people we have met in the previous volumes of the saga. I was very uncomfortable with the way religion was handled.There were also quite a few logical inconsistancies. Ayla goes hunting, but never does anything with the kill. Ayla takes her amulet off and doesn't put it back on. Ayla earns a hide but never cures it.There are quite a lot of good aspects of this book as well. Much of the plot was very nice. I don't want to talk about that for risk of ruining the charm for some folks. I liked the way that Jondalar's family was fleshed out. I liked the way Ayla thinks about and handles her pregnancy.In short, I really liked this book, but it is not a stand alone work like the others in the Series. I will probably read this book again. Probably tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The book had too much \\"padding\\" in my opinion and would have made a good shorter book. Also, for those of us following the \\"earth children\\" series I found that the book was really more concerned with the thoughts and feelings of other characters (notably Zolena) rather than Ayla. I even thought that some of Ayla's behaviour was out of character - she hardly ever took a lead role in the book and was too subordinate to Zolena - she should have been much more of an equal (since actually Ayla was much more advanced) despite her natural modesty."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've also been waiting twelve years for this book (please not so long for #6) and found this book to be a very satisfying addition to the series. I'll spare the plot details but it seems the entire book is just setting up for the next as there is almost no major conflict and Ayla is basically happy the entire time. The beginnings of problems for Ayla have begun in the book, but none are resolved.I enjoyed the very detailed descriptions of everything from plant and animal life to Zelandoni politics but at times the desciptions read like a text book and can slow down the plot. The repetition of past events also slows the story down, especially if one has recently read the previous books. The Mother's Song is beautifully written but it was not necessary to repeat it almost three times as it was quite long.Other than those things I enjoyed the story very much and would have given it five stars if not for those few things. Ayla and Jondalar are as likeable as ever as are many of the new characters, though I hope to get to know them better in the next book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I too waited for this book to come out. I bought the book and made myself comfortable to become submersed in the book as I had with the others. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The book was 600+ pages of retelling of the first 4 books with another 150+ pages of death/funeral rituals thrown in for good measure.I was looking for a good story with great desciptions of the characters and location - in short I was looking to excape reality of life for awhile. Instead I found myself hard pressed to become engaged by it.I will be waiting for the next one - hoping that Ms Auel can get back in the swing of things......"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Well, I have to agree there was a lot of repetition of the stories and explanations. Of course, if you already know those parts, you can skip them. Some readers need the reminders. However, it wasn't all that bad since we have been putting on the pressure for the next book to hit the shelf. I was satisfied with how the storyline continued though. The love scenes were a bit long and not really needed. They seemed to make the book seem \\"fluffy\\" in some parts. I feel like Auel has built up so much credibility that the extended love scenes undermine her talent. However, I am excited about the next book. Once again, her other books were better.

The dialog is dry and uninteresting, the settings don't change, and there aren't enough descriptions of the area. The sense of looking for something is missing, which is what made the first four books so good. But the worst part of the entire book are the long, drawn-out love scenes.

The latest installment in the Earth's Children's Series drags along on \\"Ayla and Jondalar get married and have a baby,\\" surrounded by hundreds of pages of obviously well-researched but often tedious details more suited to a taped narration in a natural history museum.Characterization is often reduced to caricature. Ayla, the prehistoric superwoman, is the first human being to domesticate animals and to discover the fire-starting properties of iron pyrite. Ludicrously, she also becomes the first to realize that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse.In short, this is not a novel; it's a National Geographic special."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I first discovered \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" many years ago ,I couldn't put it down...many nights I would still be readi ng at 4 a.m.!!In fact over the years I have read \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" seven times, \\"The Valley of Horses\\" three times and \\"the Mammoth Hunters\\" twice. \\"Plains of Passage\\" should have alerted me to the change of style..Ayla had become a superfical character,always right..the savior of the human race etc etc. Still when \\"Shelters of Stone\\" was finally released I must have been one of the first to purchase a copy. What an unbelieveable disappointment!!! I can understand having to reiterate on the story since it has been twelve years since the last book but please, most readers would have remembered the main theme and new readers would have read in sequence so there was no need to go on for so long.Also Auel's obvious knowledge of prehistoric times is daunting and her textbook descriptions of cave life etc are impressive especially if I had wanted to read a reference book but I bought this book for enjoyment and I found Ayla had lost her crediblity. Her character was underdeveloped and superficial. As for Jondalar he became 'a cardboard cut out'. Gone was the adventurous free spirit ..the great hunter. The love scenes between them were just a rehash from the previous books and boring to have to read again and again and again!!!!The reader does not need such graphic descriptions that are really quite out of character for prehistoric men and women! To have to wade through the same style of lovemaking so many times is dull and does nothing for plot development -least of all for reader interest.The book finally showed a bit of spark towards the end obviously setting up for a sequel but here's one reader who will be looking elsewhere for a good read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel's absence from the marketplace for twelve years has turned out to be a blessing for her devoted readers. This book demonstrates in spades the problem with almost all serial writing for profit. Like Robert Jordan's ten volume fantasy series, the first few books are great, and then the writer runs out of fresh new ideas. The result is evident. The writer repeats the same ideas over and over again with no new entertaining plot. There is no character development or any plot to this book. Jean Auel's attempt to depict how prehistoric peoples might have thought and behaved is not realistic, and doesn't appear to be based on good scientific research that took twelve years. Her repetition at least ten times of how the heroine starts a fire from flint becomes very boring. The book is overall neither fun nor interesting. The psychedelic religious trip in the cave is, however, well done. Her style of writing is also not up to par with her first few books in this series. I would not recommend this book even if you liked the first few or the first four books in the series. I will not be buying the sixth book, and supposedly and (hopefully) last book in this series, although I own first editions of the first four books in this series, and will keep those. I am getting rid of this book as it will take up to much room in my collection."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I can't add much to the other negative reviews, except to say that if Ms. Auel couldn't give her thousands of faithful fans an effort worthy of the previous books, she should have just let it (and us) go. If Jean Auel actually wrote this, then something is very, very wrong with her. Shame on her editor(s) and the publisher of this truly atrocious book, for wasting the money and, what's worse, the time of Ms. Auel's fans. I guess what with the ready made market, greed got the better of everyone involved. Well, they got my money this time. I hope they put it in the bank, because they won't get it again."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"For those of you who are not aware of it, the original author of this series passed away some years ago. Someone else took over writing the next several books, I'm not sure how many, maybe 2. I don't remember if it is someone from the family who took over the writing or someone else. Anyway, the books written by someone else are good, but they lack Jean Auel's distinctive way of writing. Just thought I would give a little perspective on this!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is quite possibly the best of the series. Ayla finally meets the ALnzadonii, Jondalar's kin, but can they accept this stragne woman and her even stranger animal friends? What will she do to their structured and traditional society? Will they finally be able to get this Matrimonial sorted out? A beautiful book, full of contrasting and realistic characters and settings."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This was good, but not quite as good as her earlier books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for Ayla to invent The Wheel (and is anyone else as irritated as I am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex?) Seriously, I can guess why Auel is constantly rehashing material from earlier books--to hide the lack of a story or interesting new characters--and I had particularly looked forward to meeting Zelandoni, the previous great love of Jondalar's life. For an entertaining and far quicker read on the subject of Stone Age life, read Joan Wolf's trilogy(Daughter of the Red Deer, The Horsemasters, The Reindeer Hunters). I've recently reread the book, and while still giving only two stars, I must say that it reads faster the second time around--maybe because of knowing which segments to skip over altogether!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...The book is more about Auel's hypothesis of what the region looked like, and how people lived, than it is and actual story. No build up. No climax. This title is a best seller because we all expected it to live up to the last four books. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close. This is the last of the series I spend good money on."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think not. It's not a book, it only looks like one.What a disappointment.Truly hope Ms. Auel reads some of the reader reviews here.(I did read all her previous works and really looked forward for this one - duhhh)"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It's easy to recommend CLAN of the CAVE BEAR. However, J.A.'s follow ups were a bit disappointing and wading through this repetitious tome is a total time waste."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"How bad is bad. Auel has certainly showed us how with this bomb. I finally closed the book for good when the kids got tired on the Journey, had a snack, then took a nap. At least the kids didn't have a cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"No story line, no plot, nothing new. Jean Auel should have combined books 4, 5 and 6 and saved all the repetitive filler. We got it the first three times. Very poor writing, very boring book, but that's free enterprise. We didn't have to grab the hook when it was offered. That's my opinion."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Unfortunately, The Shelters of Stone is a major disappointment. Only once before have I failed to finish a book because it was just too bad to continue - this now makes twice. None of the books beyond Clan of the Cave Bear ever entirely lived up to Auel's first, though at least Valley of Horses was decent if not as engrossing. This book, however, is not only boring, but the language is stilted and bordering on silly as Ayla (whom I used to like as a character) ponders every single detail of life she notices and seems to feel a need to explain it as well. Why did I get it? I was hoping that Auel had returned to her earlier style after taking so many years to complete this book. On the bright side, at least it's thick enough to make a good door stopper."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Okay, we all know that this book could have been a lot better. I mean, come on!! First of all, the book almost has no plot at all. And it took ten or twelve years for it to come out? I really should give this book two stars. Anywayz, when Ayla and Jondalar arrive at the ninth cave, everyone that is mentioned just sort of accecpts everything that Ayla and Jondalar have been up to. People are obviously scared at first of the animals, but there should have been more of a shock, or something that could keep out attention longer. The characters could have been more developed, and I would have liked to see more of a fight between Ayla and Brukeval or Laramar. Also, Zelandoni keeps saying that she would like to talk to Ayla about various things, but doesn't. I suppose that I could give the third star for not as much sex as the previous book. One other thing that really irritated me was there were two accidents right after each other (the little boy and Wolf), and Ayla never made her clothes, and after the incident with Marona, we never really heard from her again. Does anybody agree with me that instead of everybody accepting everything, shouldn't there have been more of an argument between characters? This book could not keep me hooked. I thought I was going to read it overnight because it would be so exciting, however it took me a week or two because of lack of motivation to read it. Overall, I was personally very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Book is well written and kept my interest, but there was too much condensed into one book. There where areas that I wish she had written more on and other areas less. I liked books 1-4 better then this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting 12 years for this book to come out ( I had given up hope) I was some what disapointed. I have come to expect Alya to be an independant and resoureful woman. It is as if she has just settled into the routine of daily life. Mostly the book covered what had been already written. Some of the pages were tedious and hard to keep up with. It took me about 3 days to read The Mammoth Hunters, I just couldn't stop reading. This one has left me with a bad taste. If I have to wait another 12 years to continue the saga I will be hard pressed to pay the price for the hard cover edition, and will wait till I can check it out or paperback."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Not up Jean's par. Too much repetition. Not enough plot. Too predictable. I really hope the next book is back to the level or her earlier works. And I hope it doesn't take another decade. Still an enjoyable read and a must for those following the series, but if this was the first and not the fifth book I don't know if I'd be so anxious for the next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"IMHO, this book should have been about 150 pages, not 750.Auel's 5th book in the Earth Children series is more of a historical recount of an era then a novel of a people. She spent more time describing the vegetation and rock formations then she did her characters. When she finally did get around to some dialogue, more often then not, it was passages taken from her earlier books, or to recount the same stories over and over again. Gee, was that how Whinney came to be with her, oh, ok, tell it again, please, again, again, oiy!!!The characters did not mature at all, and by the end, I was hoping for an earthquake to put my out of my misery. This book had so much potential, new antagonists, past acquaintances reemerging, not to mention the dynamic duo, however, she just dropped them all in lieu of yet another verbose description of the era. If I wanted a history book, I would have purchased one.This book was truly a disappointment. However, if you're a fan of Auel's characters, as I am, it's still a must read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After a wait of 12 years, I finally finished up book five. Boy was I shocked!! The passion that any writer uses to make a book great, was not in this book. The book answers many questions, but leaves alot to be desired as-far-as writing goes. This book tends to read like stero instructions and gives me the impression that Mrs. Auel could of cared less if this book was ever published.Although there are many high points--not alot of graphic sex--it is basically the same old same old. Jondalars' people hate flatheads. Later, Jondalars' people consider them as a kind of human and thinks about trading with them. Some of them hate Ayla and some still do at the conclusion of the book. Although Ayla doesn't invent something new, she does help a man gored by a rhino and loses a man that was trampled by a buffalo. Does these statements seem familiar?One thing is going for this book, is the good possibility that the sixth and final book will be the best one of all. Ayla, for once, doesn't grab all of the attention this time. We see more insites of the people of this time and learn more about the culture and religion of these people. We also find that during this time, there were cave painters long before Ayla and Jondalar's people. Some of the Zelandonii have the understanding that the Clan was the first people and that they had inhabited the caves that the Zelandonii now use.I only hope that the final book is a 1000% better than this one. This is my opinion and I am sticking to it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"On a first reading, it's all too obvious why this book took Auel 12 years to write. It's saddled down with far too much detail yet still manages to read like a Stone-Age-For-Dummies. There's no suspense, little thrill and it's insultingly repetitive. Auel not only repeats much of the last four books, she constantly repeats the same thing within the book (Ayla's accent is \`\`foreign'' to everyone she meets and must be noted 1,000 times, the horses obey her because she is their \`mother' and 'friend.') Even while suspending my disbelief to some level, it does seem a bit absurd that Ayla and Jondalar betwen them have invented the needle, the spear thrower, the firestone, decided where babies came from, seen how soap was invented. Yes, we all know how wonderful they both are. In fact, that's pretty much all this book reminds us of (and how)-- Ayla is the most perfect woman since Eve fell to the apple. Anyone who watches Martha Stewart knows how boring a woman without any flaws is to watch, much less read 700+ pages about."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'm wondering why everyone thus far has rated this book so highly. After having to wait only four years for this book, I'm sorry to say that it was rather disappointing to have to read the repetitious \\"Ayla of the Zelandonii greets you...\\" for the ENTIRE book. Did the summer meeting need to drag on for the entirety? Or did we really need to go through 700 pages of her demonstrating fire over and over again?Maybe I'm being critical. I, at least, have to agree with the previous reviewer. Don't bother reading this book unless you've already dedicated yourself to the series. Let's hope something happens soon with the last book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After 12 years, finally we have the 5th book. I found it not as entertaining as the previous books; however, it was the perfect book for the lead in to the supposed last book in the series. I felt it was a well rounded introduction to life with Jondalar's people and the reconization of the Clan to the Others.Gail Metzger....the wife"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After over a decade I'd anticipated this book and the news of its release with joy. I wasn't disappointed.I knew that Alya would have some trouble being accepted by all of Jondalar's people, I also knew that eventually she would be accepted because of her skills as a healer and spiritual leader.I am now anticipating the 6th and final book in the series and wonder how long that one will take."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Despite the long wait for Auel's new book, the beginning of Shelters of Stone meshes perfectly with Plains of Passage and the rest of the series. Sadly, the \\"voice\\" slips towards the end of the book, and the last portion is just a setup for the next book.I wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't read the rest of the series, but you won't need to re-read the whole story before tackling this enormous book (maybe just look over the last chapter of Plains to remember where it ended). Auel peppers the novel with reminders of what went on in the previous books (helpful, but a little annoying if you've just read the others in a marathon session, which I had...), and (thank goodness) she included a list of names at the end - I think it's the most characters she's had yet!On the whole, fans will want to have a look at this new chapter in Ayla's life, repetition and all, but try to get it from a public library first."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I found book 4 to be more tedious than the previous ones, so I did not buy this book. I did come across it a few weeks ago at the library, and so I brought it home. Glad I didn't buy it! I have to agree with the other reviewers. The 700+ pages read rather quickly, but I kept eyeing the other books on my shelf and wishing I could get to them (not a good sign). As it went on, I felt absolutely certain that she was going to reunite Ayla with Durc, as much as she kept bringing him up. But as the pages dwindled I gave up that hope. Another bad sign, in addition to looking with longing at my other unread books, is the fact that I was so disinterested in the plot that I had time to notice that all the characters from the present locale had names with 3 syllables. Names from the previous area where the travelers stayed had two syllables, and most names from the Clan had one syllable (except Ayla and a few others--now that I think about it, maybe it was broken down into male names having one and female names two? Do we care?). What does it say that I could notice something so trivial, except that I needed something to keep my mind occupied while I read?! Unless this was purposeful for a reason that I'm not seeing.To echo another reviewer, do not bother with this unless you have read all the others and really care about these two characters and plan to get #6."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Up to this point, I had looked forward to Jean Auel's books. However, after reading her latested installment I was very disappointed. Yes, she has always been wordy but it seemed the whole book was that way. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was wondering where it was going and I found out at the end. NOWHERE!! What a waste of time and money. This was one of those books that you finish and then say to yourself \\"Is THAT it?\\"..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelters of Stone is Jean M. Auel's fifth novel in the Earth's Children series, published twelve years after the fourth, The Plains of Passage.Ayla and Jondalar have reached the home of his people, the Zelandonii, and are welcomed by his family. As in the last two novels, strangers are amazed by the tame horses and wolf, impressed with the spear thrower, and disgusted by or suspicious of Ayla's background with the Clan.There is a lot of repetition from the previous novels in the series, perhaps due to the lengthy gap between the fourth and fifth novels. This might be because Auel wanted Shelters to be a stand alone novel for new readers to the series, but for those who have recently read or remember the others, it can cause the story to drag.There is not a lot of action in this book and at times it can read like a textbook on how Ancient Peoples lived, much of which was already learned in the first four novels. While there are some interesting sections, overall I was a bit disappointed. Also, if I read that darn \\"Mother's Song\\" one more time, I could have performed it at a Zelandonii festival myself!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"While I am a BIG fan of the 'Earth's Children series and bought every volume, I was extremely disappointed in the final book 'Shelters of Stone'. Remove all the flowery scene descriptions and constant recapping of the previous 4 volumes and the book would have been no more than 100 pages. What a let down after such an incredible journey. I doubt a 6th volume would fill the void left by this blunder."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is far too overdue - I find I've lost interest in the entire series. After reading this enormous (too big) book with its excess of overdone sex, I can assure you I won't be buying/reading the next one! Too much, too much, too much EVERYTHING!!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think the most interesting parts in The Earth's Children series are the scenes describing the religious ceremonies of these prehistoric people. Although I realize no one knows for certain what happened or didn't happen 30,000 or so years ago, the author manages to use archeological and anthropological facts and theories to create some very moving and believable ceremonies. I have enjoyed all the books in this series and this one is no exception.In response to some of the other reviews, I think Ayla and Jondalar are supposed to be archetypes for the kind of people that could have existed during this time so attributing nearly every new invention or discovery to them is understandable. These \\"new\\" ideas don't just pop into their heads, but come about for the most part by accidental discovery and observation. Since many of our modern day inventions have come about in the same ways, I don't think the storyline is absurd or unrealistic.I find the \\"love-story\\" theme to be another step in Ayla's development as a woman. Even though the geographical, anthropological, and archeological information is more prevelant in the first book, the story is about \\"Ayla\\" and her life, not about the sciences mentioned.This book is a work of fiction, regardless of the amount of research and factual information included, and is therefore meant to be entertaining. I think it serves its purpose quite well."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Let me begin by saying that all the reviewers are right about this book. The characters are wooden, the anthropological details are excruciating, the plot moves at the speed of a snail in a snowstorm, and the main character, Ayla, has devolved into an everlasting know-it-all and generally perfect creature who has become, at the very least, rather annoying.And then there are the sex scenes. They are extremely graphic, but in a rather unpleasant way, probably because they are so rote and humourless. Generally, any sex scene that refers to any portion of the body as having \\"folds\\" is usually rather unsexy. My dear Ms. Auel, paper folds, and laundry folds. If I or anyone else I knew had sensitive portions of their anatomy that folded, I would suggest immediate medical attention. Indeed, anyone reading these unwieldy, unsexy, cringe-inducingly cheesy love scenes may need medical attention, because they are liable to laugh themselves to death.Have I said rote and humourless? Hmmm, that's the whole book, isn't it. And though I am well aware that some ancient civlisations rivalled modern ones for their sophistications, Ms. Auel's paleolithic society seems populated by earnest liberal arts graduates embarking on an experiment in communal living and alternative religion. Though I do not pretend to know all about the Paleolithic Era, I doubt that it so strongly resembled a New Age Craft Collective.Everyone is polite, clean, bland and good-looking. Except the villains, who are the only characters in the book with some real teeth. I for one, very much liked Brukeval. I liked him a lot better than Ken, I mean, Jondalar. If there is any character with less personality who is more nauseating than Ayla has come to be, it's our favourite hunky himbo of yesteryear. Him and his entire cardboard family and their tasteful multi-room caveman condos.Multi-room condos? Herbal birth control? Sensitive, politically correct men and the stately and wise matriarchs who spawned them? No war, no conflict of any kind, not even the odd fistfight or family squabble? Quiet, clean children and well-behaved, responsible teenagers, all of whom look down on the local trailer trash family, complete with drunken slag mom and welfare king dad?Just who do you think you're kidding, Ms. Auel? What did the human race do, devolve into the querulous, quirky, unruly, ultraviolent and yet creative and diverse species of monkeys in pants that we are today?Erm, as a historian, I woulkd venture to say that I don't think so.Yes, friends and neighbours, this book, like every one in the series after Clan of the Cave Beat is boring, repetitive, wildly unrealistic trash.And I loved it.I love all these books. I love them because they are hooty, corny, unrealistic escapist garbage, although I must admit I skip over most of the sex bits and botany lessons. It seems odd to me that so many readers are decrying this latest book in the series for the aforementioned sins, when every book since Cave Bear has been replete with them.A genuine flower in the dustbin, a tawdry, trashy, bloated classic of its kind. Here's hoping the penultimate book is every bit as charmingly awful, divinely ridiculous and entertainingly bad!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished the book. I had read the other four, years ago, and I was disappointed it took so long to get Shelters of Stone out. I agree with the criticism of the tedious details and repetitions, but I believe that the author or editor (publisher) felt it was necessary in light of the huge gap in time between Plains of Passage and this one.I enjoyed the book, simply skimming over the plant physiology lectures and the anthropological discourses. I am impressed with Ms. Auel's knowledge, but after a while I just page through it to get back to the story.Despite the shortcomings, the book is entertaining, a good summer holiday read, and I look forward to the 6th. But I hope its out sooner than later."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read with earnest the first four books in the Earth's Children series and looked forward to following Ayla and Jondalar through the fifth. I was disappointed, however, at the numerous repetitions. Many scenes were repeated, nearly word for word, without purpose. Had the scenes had some sort of significance, or added emphasis to the plot, it would have been different; I wonder if, while writing, Ms. Auel just repeated herself so the book's heft would compare with that of the others.Overall, I enjoyed the story and found the plot satisfying. I am happy, however, that I waited to purchase the paperback."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I did not enjoy this book as much as I liked the others in the series. It seemed to be a bit choppy, and did not have a definitive ending point, like the others did. There were loose threads and unresolved conflicts that needed answers, obviously leading into the next book, but it seems a cheap ploy to entice readers to continue the series. The other books all ended in ways that made you want to find out more, but were still satisfactory endings, not unresolved situations.I agree with one reviewer who said something about Jondalar's worries about the acceptance of Ayla by his people because of her clan past was unfounded. It seemed not to be that big of a deal to anyone, and wasn't there someone who was supposed to be part Clan who was J's cousin or distant relation or something? (Can't remember the name, it has been awhile since I read it.) He was obviously around before J. left on his long journey, so what was the big deal with Ayla? Did J's people change that much in the 5 years he was gone?Not a bad read, overall, but a bit choppy, probably overly long and drawn out as one reviewer mentioned, and as one of my friends who read it said, it's a bit like prehistoric soap opera."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like you who have read both the book and the \\"professional\\" critiques, I felt guilty for disliking this latest in the sequel with such intensity. But then I relaxed when I read the reviews of the average fan of Auel's - I'm normal after all. This book was so dissappointing. I found myself reading each new page just hoping that she would return to the fresh and origianl style of historical fiction that I had grown to long for. But the book never delivered. I'm waiting for her next book. Even the greatest of athletes strike out once in a while and I'm certain that her next work will be a home run. If you've never read the first four books don't bother. Read this one and you'll know everything you needed to know about the first four. Then read the first four and realize how great the series really is.

(warning a small spoiler:) for example, when the wolf gets attacked by a wolf pack and then recovers, and then threatens a man who took the skin of one of the wolf pack that the wolf killed, they were supposed to go out and locate the battle scene... this did not make it into the kindle edition.Additionally, for some reason there are markers claiming to \\"highlight\\" but that cannot be removed -- that becomes destracting -- it is as though who ever converted this over to kindle had previously read and marked for notes some interesting ideas that the author presents..The only reason I bought this was so that I can complete a second re-read of the entire story, thankful that with a few exceptions the graffic sexual sequences were not included, making for a much more appoachable story.A final note -- I found I read the kindle books faster with less eye strain because I can control the character sizing... beware that you too might find the story over faster than if it were a standard printed version -- since it does not have paper or binding issues, I would hope that Kindle prices would not have an equal to price, but it seams that it does have pricing remenescent to trade paper back, if you don't want to buy and are willing to use the printed version -- borrow from a public library so you can return it afterwards..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed the book. I wanted more action like the previous four, but the book was good. The author could have kept the description of how the people reacted to Ayla's animals to a minimum. She encountered a lot of new people and each were surprised and fearful of domesticated animals."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As the series progresses they become more and more repetitive to the point that there appears to be absolutely nothing new to to reveal for Earth's Children. I could not even finish it as a storyline or plot was never really developed."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have recently read books #2 - #5 in this series over the last few weeks so I have a good grasp as to Ms. Auel's style and characters. Either Ms. Auel has taken some writing classes and drastically changed her style or she, at the very least, had a co-writer while writing this book, probably her son.Her previous works had characters that were pretty much as flat and lifeless as the pages the story was written on. It was almost like someone telling a story to herself and not needing all that extra material. The hook for the stories is pretty much: \\"What will Ayla do next?\\" It's kinda fun to see what strange piece of good fortune or dramatic rescue she will do next and everything, including Ayla, is window dressing to this process.In this book, suddenly there is some life - shallow as it may be - added to the storyline. Some of the characters have a little bit of color and individual identity added to them. The biggest change is the new \\"male\\" energy that seems to be powering the characters actions and words. It's as if a guy wrote the character development sections and Ms. Auel wrote the environmental coloring about plants, animals, etc., though a lot of that seems almost word-for-word from previous books.As previously mentioned, there is a lot of repetition and carry-over from the previous books but that is almost unavoidable as Ayla's entering a new world with groups of new people that are shocked and curious about her and her history, especially as it is collaborated by one of their own, Jondalar. Plus, we're in on what their reaction will probably be, so we're waiting and gleefully anticipating it.Lastly, I read the final book in the series as well. Again, I think there's a co-writer involved though in that case I believe it might be her daughter. The book has more of a female flavor."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been reading and following the series for 20 years. I actually had thought that the author had passed away, it was so long between books 4 and 5. I also was under the impression that the series was to consist of 5 books only. So when Shelters of Stone came out I was pleasantly surprised! I read the free preview on Kindle, and although not particularly impressed, I decided to read the book, figuring that it would be the last in the series, and string together all the loose ends.I slogged thorough over 700 pages of drivel, only to have the story end in such predictable disappointment.It is obvious that the series will continue for multiple more books, rehashing old stories and introducing more boring characters in an attempt to make more money for the author. My time is too precious to waste any more time on these characters. I have no intention to follow this series further, as it is obvious from the last several books that nothing new will change. Ayla will continue to be Super-woman, with her perfect mate and family, and she will continue to be the discoverer of all important human accomplishments (the wheel!!!, cultivation of crops!!!, the written language!!!).A beautifully written character in Clan of the Cave Bear has been slowly turned into a caricature."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I love the continuing life journey of these characters! They're like old friends to me. I can always count on this book series to be interesting, educational, and to hold my attention without being dramatic or unrealistic- not that there aren't dramatic parts, because their are- but the drama in this series is based on an entire life unfolding rather than a short time span like most books are. The characters are ones I have fallen in love with."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have always loved the 'Earth's Children' series. I read Plains of Passage and Shelters of Stone almost back to back. While I thoroughly enjoyed this one, the endless descriptions got really boring after the first 100 pages or so. I admit, I skipped over quite a bit of it. But overall, I still liked the book and the plot, even if it was a bit slow at times, and after the way Auel ended this one, I'm looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I looked forward to the release of this book and was sorely disappointed. I loved the other ones so much that I reread them at least every few years. This book seemed different. The characters seemed duller and less interesting. I found myself skipping huge blocks ... even pages and pages at a time ... looking for something and never quite finding it. Too much time was spent retelling the happenings from the previous books. I believe this book was geared more towards a fresh new audience that had not read the previous books. Hopefully, the next one will come out sooner and have more exciting things happening to my beloved Ayla."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read all her previous books and looked forward to reading her 5th novel. The Shelters of Stone was drawn out on setting the background of the Cro-Magnon People of the time; how they lived, the landscape, etc. I would have loved to see more of the character's built in to the story than the the background of the time. I do hope that the last novel really build's into the character's. Especially the Zelondonia of the Nineth cave and the other character's within the cave. This book did seem to set the stage for the next book; and I am looking forward to it. The ending left you thinking whether or not Ayla would accept who she really is - one of the elite and gifted Zelondonia?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"There was a lot of opportunity to have an exciting book, bu there wasn't any follow through. The repetition was amazing. I understand having to recap some of the events from the previouis books to refresh memories, but did we really have to read how Ayla got the horse 15 different times? After the first explanation, wouldn't \\"Ayla explained how she acquired the animals,\\" have been enough? There's plenty of conflict set up for the next book--if Auel will use it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"First, I've read all the books in the series and enjoyed them. Okay \\"Plains of Passage\\" was a boring read but not too bad. In \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" Jean Auel makes Ayla out to be some kind of super-woman, who invented open heart surgery to figuring out \\"where babies come from.\\"The promblem? It's gone too far. I think the long wait between books as made me lose interest. Either that or Ms. Auel can't write Ayla anymore. She lost her momentum. At the beginning it was fun to see Ayla invent all this stuff, but the fun is gone. I suppose this can happen with a series or a series of books with one character in the center. (I just hope Patricia Cornwell can keep Kay Scarpetta fresh for a long time yet.)What I will say in Auel's favor, her research is amazing. The lady does her homework and it shows.For newcomers to the series, start with \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" and follow in order, quickly. That way you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"All those people that are slating the newest Jean Auel book do admittedly have a slight point. This book is not as good as Clan of the Cave Bear, it is however, in my opinion way better than the Vallety of the Horses - which was just an excuse for soft-porn Cave Man style!!! The Clan of the Cave Bear and the Mammoth Hunters were by far the best books in the series - found plains of Pasage too farfetched. Give Shelters of Stone a break, it's not a literary masterpiece but it is nice pleasant easy reading. It's a nice enough story, and I don't think that it is as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. Some of the characters are actually rather pleasant - Marthona and Zelandoni for example, Folora is personally a favorite of mine and I hope to see more of her. I do agree though that Jondalar is a waste of space. He is a one-dimensional character used only for Aylas sexual gratification. (Personally preferred Ranec and Thonalon and think that the wrong brother got taken out!) The only thing that makes Jondalar slightly less than perfect is his jealousy, and while Ayla doesn't even have this tiny flaw in her personality, she is a lovable character, and will always be a favorite, no matter how predictable she has become. Give it a chance, just try not to compare it to Clan of the Cave Bear coz to that book, it just doesn't make the grade, but on its own, it's quite enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I was really disappointed by this book. I've read all of the previous books, and this one seemed to be relatively boring. It seemed to drag, and too much time was spent describing the landscape, the animals, the people and the way they lived, over and over again. The story itself was good, but not fulfilling, and left a lot hanging. I realize there's probably another one in the works, hopefully it will be better written."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved the other two books in this series and was truly looking forward to this book - I couldnt be more disappointed. I'm an advid reader - and this book was painful at times to read. Normally I would of just stopped - but out of curosity and loyality I finished it. This story could of been told in half the pages. Some background and info is nice - but the detail was long winded and more often that not - repetitive. I swear I read the same descriptive paragraphs more than once. I got the description of the cave the first time - didnt need it over and over again.My greatest urge while reading this book was to get out a red marker and start crossing out passages. So if you dont mind scanning through the extra verbage to get to the meat of the story this is okay and minus a couple hundred pages it would of been great - oh well. Cant recommend it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Although I was greatly anticipating this book, I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. It seemed to be very choppy, laboured, and extremely lengthy. Though the story didn't go very far, I was glad to get reaquainted with our old friend Ayla."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Basically, I really enjoyed the book. It's a great addition to the series, BUT it did get a little bogged down in places and over-described. I thought it was too long and Ms Auel was just filling in stuff to impress us with her research.It also got a little tiring reading about the Wonder Woman of the Cro-magnon. The reader is made to think that Ayla singlehandedly transformed the evolution of Homo Sapiens. And got to marry Superman too. Wow. Do you think Marvel knows about this?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Absolutly riving - as good as all of her others. My only disappointment was coming to the end of the book!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This was a great book. I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"another wonderful book in the Earth's Children series....a must for the collector of this brillant author's work....I did wish it had been in paperback though...."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Auel fans will not be disapointed. Ayla is again brought to life in vivid detail, as well as the beloved characters of Jondalar, Whinney, Racer and Wolf. In this book we meet Zelandoni, Jondalar's former lover, who delves into the mystery of Ayla and what her ultimate destiny will be. The spiritual journey of Ayla is foreshadowed eloquently in this book.There are many moving moments and you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this is a work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read all the books and was very much looking forward to this new one. It's a good read if you love descriptions of *everything* and I mean everything. It's great to see Ayla home with the man she loves and becoming part of his family/tribe but it's lacking something. The space that is used by the repetition of formal names and ideas gets really old after a while and I too found myself skipping over entire paragraphs.As a whole, the book is still a good read and I would recommend it to any Jean Auel/Ayla fan."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited for many years for this book to be written and be printed. Jean Auel did another wonderful job in the way she described everything to the littlest point. This is what makes her books so riveting. I read the Mammoth Hunters about 10 years ago and wondered at the time if Ayla and Jondalar would make the journey back to his home. This summer I will read the first 4 books again and enjoy them once again like it ws the first time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Well I just finished The shelter of stone,and I must say (in my option) Jean, you did it again, Another masterpeice,one of though book that, when you start reading you don't want to put down. And here I am waiting for your next book to be written. A true masterpeice............Just can't wait for the next one"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If Valley of Horses made you cringe, if Mamoth Hunters made you gag, if Plains of passage put you to sleep, fear not, for here at last is a book that stands up to the original! The plot is interesting; the writing style polished, but down to earth; and the characterizations supurb. I even found myself liking Jondalar for the first time! Ayla in particular is better here, she has truly become a character almost anyone can both admire and relate to. Without giving anything crucial away, after a year of traveling, Ayla and Jondalar reach the Zelandonii (Jondalar's people) at last. Since Ayla is now pregnant, she's quite naturally glad to be among other women once again, and yet, will all of Jondalar's people be welcoming? Expecially once they realize she was raised by Clan, whom they look on as animals? All in all, this was a great book that I truly enjoyed. All the supporting characters as well as the main characters were portrayed realistically and well. I recommend this book to anyone sixteen or older who has an interest in the far past."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read many reviews of this bool and I don't understand, the only book of the series that I have not read countless times is the first one, CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. This book was everthing I expected of it. My biggest question is, is everyone reading the same book???????????? I have read SOS twice now and do not find anything out of line with Ms. Auel's writing, just one question will we have to wait so long for book 6?..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished it and I've got a great big smile on my face. It starts out slow but by the end you want more. Thats half the fun imagining what will be next. If your the earthy type this series is a must read. My all time favorite set of books. Get the series and set off on the adventure of a lifetime. If the next one is truely the last please please make it twice as long."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I couldn't wait for Jean Auel's fifth book in the series and pre-ordered it. I have to admit, her fifth book in the series isn't as strong as the other four, but my interest in Ayla's and Jondalar's welfare never wanes! I cried when they are suffering. I feel joy at their triumphs. They are old friends at this point and I want to see them make it--as a couple and as leaders in their community. I only hope my success is a fraction of hers (Jean's) in the years to come as my first book, \\"Forever Retro Blues\\" has only come out this year. I hope Jean doesn't make us wait as long for the next adventure as she did promise this would be a six book series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The graphic design of the book jacket is rotten! The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved all the Earth's Children books but was so disappointed to read loves scenes (over and over) in \\"Stone\\" that read like today's romance novels.Jean Auel goes to great lengths to give the reader a feel for life 30,000 ago. I am just somewhat disappointed with the graphic love details."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like most Ayla fans I was eagerly waiting the arrival of this book. When I saw it in the bookstore I purchased it right away and finished it 2 days later.As with her other books, Jean Auel captivates from the very first paragraph. The book brings to a close the tesion that has been built in the prior books regarding the nervousness in Ayla over meeting Jondalar's kin. Also the nervousness in Jondalar about introducing Ayla to his kin who have very different ideas about the Clan than he or Ayla do.Auel, beautifully describes the scenery, it is not long or drawn-out but serves to draw the reader back to the place of the book. While there is some repetition, after 12 years of no new books, it is needed both for those who have never read the earlier books, and for those who haven't re-read the earlier books. To not include repetion in the dialogue as Ayla meets new people, would result in wondering if the people she is meeting truly realise the person that they are meeting.I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to be taken back to these ancient times and be lost in the surroundings and stresses of everyday life encountered by these people."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After putting her fans on hold for several years, Jean Auel's The Shelters of Stone delivered a relatively disappointing product. Again, Auel clearly demonstrates that she has researched the daily lives of early man in stunning detail. However, this latest book does not deliver anything new or interesting to the reader. Ayla, her proto-feminist(?) protagonist, does exactly what she has done in previous novels: be kind to children and old people, heal furry critters, question religious, cultural, & scientific norms, and make passionate love with her man.I can only assume the book is a bridge into the final chapter of the life of Ayla which will in all likelihood bring together her people with those of the Clan. Save your dollars and get this one from the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"SHELTERS OF STONE TAKES THE READER BACK INTO ALYAS AND JONDALARS LIVES ONCE THEY ARRIVE AT HIS HOME. ALYAS IMPRESSING PEOPLE AGAIN WITH HER MANY TALENTS. PEOPLE ARE AMAZED WITH THE ANIMALS BEING SO FRIENDLY. I FELL UNDER THE AUTHORS SPELL ONCE AGAIN THE SAME WAY AS WITH THE OTHER FOUR BOOKS. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE SIXTH AND FINAL BOOK IN THE SERIES IS OUT. I FIND WITH THESE BOOKS I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THEM BUT FEEL BAD WHEN I'M DONE KNOWING THE SERIES WILL SOON BE OVER."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have to say that I did enjoy the book. As usual Jean Auel gives us things to think about. If it is true that we knew so much about healing at that time, then the dark ages really took a lot of that away didn't it? I like reading what she thinks happened during that time and deciding if If I see a different scenario.As for the storyline. Yes, the sex was a long and I skipped a lot of that. And I was disappointed that the storyline didn't go any further along than it did. My first reaction was, \\"I have to wait ten or more years to get the rest of the story?\\" \\"I don't know if I will care by that time\\".I think you have to enjoy science to enjoy Jean Auel and she can even get a little long winded in that area. But I can feel her exitement at what she learns during the research for her books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Would the real Jean Auel stand up. This book,THE SHELTERS OF STONE, seems like the author had three people read the other books in this series and then had them each pen the chapters. It is a great drop below her other books. No real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book. And with the new problems introduced in this book, the reader is left with a sense of loss. No closure to Ayla's pain about Durc. No meeting among the Clan and the Zelandonii. Ayla has to be able to strut her stuff for the good of her new people."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"No, this is not the incredibly awesome, \\"gee would I love to go back in time to be there & see all this happen\\" of the first 4 books in the series, but I was glad to see what happened to Ayla and Jondalar, AT LAST. Yes, it was a lot about people thinking Ayla was strange and then loving her, but that's pretty much what all the books have been about really. I too was disappointed in the way the birth of the long-awaited Ayla & Jondalar's baby was treated, almost as an afterthought, but I am still glad I read it.My only complaint is about her erotica--I REALLY don't need all of that in these books! I read romance for that, not bopoks that I also learn something about our earliest ancestors in. My 13 year old wants to read them, but beyond Clan, I don't think they are appropriate for that but now I find them hidden under her mattress, because she too wants to see what happens to Ayla. Can't blame her--Ayla is a fascinating woman!Like other reviewers have said, if you read the other four, and have been waiting to see what happened, this is a good read. If you are looking for earthshaking literature, you won't find it here."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is tiresome!!! Took real effort to read it all the way to the end. I was very much looking forward to this book which turned out to be a real snore. By the end of the first hundred pages I felt like Ayla was a prehistoric McGyver. Good grief, the needle, bow and arrow, etc., I wondering how it was she didn't invent electricity (wait, no, that was Ben Franklin). The effort to get to the end of definitely not worth it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I HAVE READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEM SO I EAGERLY BOUGHT THE LATEST INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES. I TRIED READING IT SEVERAL TIMES AND GOT BOGGED DOWN SO I ENDED UP GETTING THE UNABRIDGED AUDIO VERSION FROM THE LIBRARY! IN MY OPINION THE BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF. THE AUTHOR REPEATS HERSELF CONSTANTLY, EXPLAINING OVER AND OVER AGAIN DETAILS OF JONDALAR AND AYLA'S JOURNEY. I FOUND THAT UNNEEDED AND VERY ANNOYING. I LIKED THE FACT THAT AYLA WAS A VERY STRONG CHARACTER AND THAT WOMEN WERE CONSIDERED AS EQUALS TO MEN IN THE BOOK AND IF YOU CUT OUT ALL THE REPETETIVE DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION IT IS A FAIRLY GOOD READ. HOWEVER, I AM NOT SURE IF I WILL BOTHER WITH THE NEXT EPISODE."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Human society 30,000 years ago. Glaciers still gripped the world. Mammoths walked the Earth. Wildlife teemed, many species dwarfing today's modern variety. Written language hadn't been conceived of yet. No one planted anything; one merely harvested what fruits and nuts one happened to find; agriculture was nonexistent. Animals were hunted, but there were no domesticated animals. Nobody had thought of it yet. Of course people understood the concept of motherhood; a woman gave birth to a baby; that was simple enough. But the concept of a man's sperm joining with a woman's egg to create a zygote--such an understanding of cause-and-effect was utterly beyond their thinking. And so no one had a father; only a mother who happened to be \\"Blessed by the Great Earth Mother.\\"Thus is the pre-historic world created by Jean M. Auel.This is the fifth installment of the Earth's Children series, a chronicle of Ayla, a cro-magnon girl who is raised by Neanderthals, and then sets off on her own to seek out her true people.In this book, Ayla and her lover Jondalar at long last arrive at the home of Jondalar's people, the Zelandonii. Ayla is overwhelmed at the sheer numbers of people living together in a gigantic limestone cave in a land we call France. She learns their spiritual beliefs, their social customs, their politics, their sexual morality, and--sadly--their prejudices, their envies, and their insecurities. In short, she meets the human race, head-on.And therein lies the only criticism I have of this book--it draws so many parallels between pre-history and modern times that it borders on social activism. It's sometimes close to being a parable.But fear not, those who love Ayla (as I do) . . . she is ever the strong, resourceful, beautiful and vulnerable woman who is the stuff of dreams. As she learns to acclimate, she carries herself with aplomb; as she asks seemingly naive questions, she commands respect with her insights; as she recounts her childhood, she inspires awe. And undeniably the most important day of her life approaches--her formal matrimonial with Jondalar. Those who love Ayla will not be disappointed by this book. And for those who don't know Ayla, you'll be as bewitched as the rest of us.And lest I forget . . . the love scenes are hot enough to melt a glacier!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Having read the whole series.... book 1 ROCKED, book 2 was not bad... book 3 was cheesy.... book 4 was a bore, book 5 however seems to be getting back on track and is on par with book 2. Ms. Auel has this nasty habit of repeating everything so much that you have the feeling its to compensate for lack of inspiration. Lady, if we've gotten to book 5 all we need is a reminder (think flat heads) you don't have to tell us everything all over again, and DEFINITLY not more than once per book. That and between book 2 and this book, the sex scenes were coming on so hard and fast that you had the feeling it was because she couldn't think of anything better to write. Thankfully, while we do get the occational sex scene in this book, we also get the \\"jondaler made love to ayla for all the rest of that night.\\" rather than 15 pages of blow by grunt detail. Instead, in this book, Ms auel is at least ATTEMPTING to integrate detail reviews into the story line rather than simply dumping paragraphs from previous books on us yet again, and has begun developing some new characters... although the repetitive nature of some of those with previous characters is a little annoying.Clearly, while a much better effort than her last two, this book is NOT on par with Clan of Cave Bear, although fans of Alya will be placated."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was a teenager when the previous books were published and enjoyed reading them in secrecy (my parents didn't really approve such hot stemming sex scenes for their already full of hormones teenager....English isn't my mother's tongue so I guess it took me a little longer to read it....I actually canceled a shift at work cuz I just could't stop reading. As roman romantic as it is I just love those characters so much. I suppose we would all like to have a little more ayla or jondalar in us. The beauty, the strength, the freedom and off course the passionate love are making me think off stories and writers who create kind of parallel worlds created so smartly and with so much knowledge."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've loved the series since book one, and decided to re-read books 1-4 before peeking at Shelters of Stone. What a treat! Auel writes with such rich detail and creates main characters that are three-dimensional, physically, mentally and spirtually that they become part of the reader. She brings to life the pre-historic world of Europe where the glaciers greatly affected the climate, where mammoths and other gigantic mammals roamed the earth, and where Neanderthol and modern man lived side-by-side, if not cooperatively. The characters live off the sometimes harsh land and its rich bounty of plant and animal life. Auel's exhaustive research is evident in her descriptions of everything from the size of a giant deer's antlers to the raspberry bushes to the leather clothing to the primitive paintings on cave walls. You get the feeling that Auel herself has excavated Ayla's amulet pouch and opened it, personally discovering the treasures within.In book one, Clan of the Cave Bear, we met Ayla, a young blond girl of five who is orphaned by an earthquake and rescued and then raised with love by the people of the Clan. These Neanderthols lead a life rich with spirituality and tradition. Unfortunately, the Others, apparently the direct ancestors of modern man, consider the Clan to be little more than animals, and fear and hate their mere existence. In book two we meet Jondalar, a Zelandoni who has journeyed far from his home. He is attracted to the enigmatic Ayla, but is also replused by her past interaction with \\"flatheads.\\" Book three has Jondalar still a bit repulsed, but by the end, he unconditionally accepts Ayla and hopes that his family will feel the same. This potential prejudice creates constant tension throughout all the previous books, including book four, which is a somewhat tedious tale of their almost year-long journey to return to the land of the Zelandoni.Ayla's unique childhood allow her some unique discoveries. She is the first to introduce the concept of raising animals for companionship and for assistance with the sometimes difficult tasks of every day life. She brings with her two steppe horses that she has trained for riding and hauling. And she is apparently responsible for introducing the canine as (wo)man's best friend. She believes that intercourse is the cause of reproduction, rather than the \\"mixing of spirits\\" as everyone else believes. She even discovers the predecessor to the modern match!!In Shelters of Stone, Ayla and Jondalar finally reach the Zelandoni. Because she comes with such unusual skills, including that of healing, she is highly valued by most of the Zelandoni. Her strength of character helps pull her through some anti-Clan sentiment, but the reader revels in Ayla's power and strength, rather than agonizing over potential weaknesses. This book is full of love and support for Ayla, and the reader breathes a sigh of relief and feels an almost personal pride in her successes.Auel's descriptions of everyday prehistoric life, from the toilet to the matrimonial ceremony are tremendously detailed and feel very authentic. This series is well-written and is well worth reading again and again. Book five, Shelters of Stone, is a reward to the loyal fan. Although you can read it as a stand-alone, you will feel more a part of Ayla's life if you read about her from the beginning. So pick up all five books and enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I was twelve, I discovered the interesting covers of The Clan of the Cave Bears in my mothers stack of books, I picked it up and started reading it. I zipped through the series and was devastated that I would have to wait for the next book! I love how Auel writes, I enjoy how her words flow, I'm interested in the history, culture, survival and life experiences that Ayla shares.The day The Shelters of Stone was available, I grabbed my copy, I sat in Borders, not able to survive the fifteen minute trip home before exploring the opening pages of the book. Maybe I can blame my age when I began reading the Earths Children series... I want to re-read the series to see if I really could have thoroughly enjoyed and been inspired in my own writing by Auel. Shelters of Stone was simply awful. I forced myself to read 250 pages and beyond that, I put the book on the side of my bed and just forgot about it until I was cleaning my room to pick what goes with me to college. The Shelters of Stone, from what I read, was nothing new, it was all review, it seemed the characters had gone \`flat' and uninteresting. I got tired of the same descriptions and really, I can't even remember what happened in Shelters of Stone other than Ayla met Jondalar's people. I realize it must not be easy to write thousands of pages and it's difficult to think up new events and idea's to happen with the various people, however, I just wasn't satisfied or entertained - at all. I won't bother purchasing the last novel and I'd like my money back. I read one persons review, she seems to think WE have betrayed Auel as loyal readers with our opinions but at least we bought Auels book, it seems to me that might be the only reason Auel continued writing--for the money, because there was no heart in this book. If you insist on reading this book, wait for a used paperback."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Beautifuly written! I was quite suprised when i heard that one of my favorite authors had picked up her pen again after such a long wait. But it was worth it! I was once more transported to the iceage where Ayla and her soon to be mate Jondelar conclude their long journey and arrive at Jondelars home at the Zelandoni Caves. The amount of detail and accuracy she puts into her work is astounding. I expecially liked Aylas experiences in the beautiful holy caves where she goes on a spirituel journey. It was an extremely pleasurable experience to read this wonderfully crafted novel, and it is one that i plan to repeat often. I cannot wait until Auel comes out with the conclusion to this spectacular series. Hopefully this one will not take her nearly as long to write and publish."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Just to reiterate what others have written. This book is a big disappointment when you a big fan of the series and have waited so long for it to come. Don't get me wrong, if you ARE a fan, I would still buy it. If you can wait for paperback though, you won't feel like you wasted so much money though.The repetition is bad, yes. But more, I was frustrated how things we have been anticipating and waiting for never happened, or were just so different than we had been led to expect. For instance, all the times we've been told how the Zelandonii hate the Clan and when the time of confrontation comes, there's nothing to it!! I felt so cheated.I don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say that this story leaves too much undone. I suppose this is a lead-in for book 6, but it should have been more self-contained. I kept waiting for issues to be resolved, and they just fizzled out at the end.I wouldn't say this is the worst book I have read, but it certainly is not what I've come to expect from Ms. Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Unfortunately I received this book for Mother's Day and feel obligated to read it from cover to cover. Under normal circumstances I'd chuck a book this boring into the can and pick up something more stimulating. I'm on page 310 (it's taken me 4 weeks to get this far) and wish I was on page 749 so I could put this thing on the shelf to gather dust. When my family asks if I'm enjoying my book I cross my fingers and repy, oh yes, thank you very much."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I gave it five stars because I liked it. I considered giving it four stars because I don't think this book will hold much for a person who hasn't read the previous books in the series. It ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures, but it doesn't carry a lot of excitement of its own. Obstacles are too easily overcome. This book works well as a step in a larger series, but I don't think it could stand on its own."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've read so many negative reviews.......gee it seems that everyone just wants action and suspense. I for one was so relieved to continue the imaginative story of Ayla's life and it not just be tragedy after tragedy.I loved all the books (sure, some more than others) but; no one's life can be filled with only tragedy. Ayla deserved peace and serenity. Yet, I know there is more to come... (I would love to see a book about the clan and Durc after Ayla left and what becomes of him -- these books could go on forever!)I just enjoyed reading of her finally enjoying life, happiness and love.My advice, just enjoy the serenity and imagine having your own Jondalar!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the Shelters of Stone over a 3 day period. I had to force myself to keep from reading the whole thing in one day. It was definitely worth the 10 year wait. The story picked up right where Plains of Passage left off. I loved every minute of it. I first discovered the Earth's Children series in 1987. I was hooked from the start. Jean Auel obviously does a great deal of research and I love her writing style. I will await the final book in this series anxiously. I'm curious to know what will happen to Ayla, Jondalar and baby Jonayla in the final book. I'm sure that no matter what the story is, it will be as exciting and emotional as the first 5 books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been waiting for this book for years and now that it s out I finished it in one day! It's great Ayla and Jondalar are finally home and they make wonderful friends despite ayla's background. Forget about the book being long it has great desciptions and the interaction between all 80+ characters is simplay amazing. I think Auel has outdone herself with this one. A definate must have for anyone interested in historical fiction or the Ice age."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The book was ok, there was writing on one of the pages, but that was not too bad.

Right after the movie ended I realized my dad HAD that book! In 5th grade I read The Clan of the Cave Bear, in 6th I read The Valley of Horses, in 7th I read The Mammoth Hunters and The Plains of Passage, and then finally in the 11th grade I got to read The Shelters of Stone!I feel that I waited 6 years for a book of lower quality. Ayla no longer has serious struggles, just that people hate her for being perfect! I found myself imagining her making a major mistake, starting a fight, or even getting hurt while hunting just to add to the action! This was the overall most boring book of the series, even with all the descriptionary pages I glazed over in The Plains of Passage! I don't even remember what the masses of the pages were about!This series is my favorite, I even started writing because of it! I refuse to give up hope! There is, after all, one more book! I'm still waiting, but not as eagerly..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book, as I have enjoyed the previous book of this series. It is not as good as the first on but better written than book 2,3,and 4."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I liked the book, but little things in it were annoying. I swear it probably talked about how different people noticed Ayla's accent a million times! There were simaler repitions that bugged me too; I could probably even write a 700 page book about them. Overall, I still liked the storyline and characters. I also thought it was an improvement over the last book which I found boring and tedious. (I didn't read all of it, I just skipped over the boring stuff.) Anyway, I hope Auel didn't spend the entire 12 years on the book because from the other reviews I read it looks like people didn't think much of it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is almost a retelling of 'The Mammoth Hunters' from the POV of Jondalar's tribe. While there are some new twists (the bitchy ex, the town drunk), for the most part I was a little bored by this book. Even 'The Plains of Passage' had more plot than this book! I think that Auel's storytelling has become more mass-market and less individual throughout the course of this series...the first three books were wonderful, the fourth a bit dry and pedantic but with this one she doesn't even seem particularly interested in her subject. Hopefully, her sixth book will be better-if there is one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"A few thoughts on some of the criticisms others have noted:1) Repetitiousness. Yes, Shelters of Stone hearks back to the other books many times, and even repeats some events (introduction of Wolf, etc.) within this book. That doesn't really bother me. I like touches that make the events of the book minute-by-minute and realistic, including repetition. To me, the interest is in the small differences in what happens each time.2) Ayla's apparent goddesslike status. I disagree. Auel emphasizes at many different places how most of Ayla's insights and inventions are due to her unusual \\"niche\\" as a solo Cro-Magnon brought up by Clan Neanderthals who must adapt to 1) Clan ways that were adapted for Neanderthal bodies and psyches, 2) Life alone, 3) Life among the Mamutoi and now, 4) Life among the Zelandonii. It isn't that Ayla has some inborn goddesslike quality; Auel even portrays her weird trips into the Spirit World as a result of that root she ate back in the Clan days. It isn't that other people are dumb - they just have generally not been in positions of such extreme necessity to adapt, and have the ways of their tribes to fall back on and their tribes' taboos to forbid thoughts that are too \\"outside the box.\\" Ayla is lucky in that she's perceived as good-looking by the Cro-Magnon peoples-always a bonus, and because she seems to have an inner positive attitude that has helped her adapt to many difficulties. She has also had the luck of having good people around at critial moments, starting with Iza. Anyone remember Aratroa from Plains of Passage? Her twisted life is an example of how a person can come out very differently from Ayla when placed in a cruible without the luck of having loving people around when it counts. Ayla's own discomfort with people's awe of her at many points in the series stems from the fact that she knows she has the abilities she does mostly because of her circumstances. The irony that keeps visiting her is that although she'd love to just fit in, have Jondalar's kids and be happy, her life story has molded her into someone who, like it or not, brings change in her wake, that is, a person of power. Marthona and especially Zelandoni pick up on this and become concerned that Ayla's power be harnessed for the good of the people.3) Lack of plot or character development. Again, I disagree, though there is something to the comments about this being \\"buildup\\" to the events of the next book. This book is where the events of the next book will have their seeds, I'm sure...and to me, that's plot enough. You have to have an eye for detail to appreciate it. Similarly, given the short amount of time covered in Shelters of Stone, it would be unrealistic to have momentous character shifts. Ayla's main move, aside from gradually becoming used to living with larger numbers of people, is to become more accepting of the disciplined specialness the Zelandonii are pushing on her."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Is it just me, or does anyone else wonder how Ms. Auel can possibly reach the intended goal of this series (the apparent envisioned meeting of Ayla's sons) in only one more book? Shelters of Stone should have spent more time delving into Durc's life after Ayla's \\"death\\"/departure from the clan (starting with the clan needing to find a new cave) in addition to Ayla's adapting to Jondalar's cave home.Ayla and Jondalar have traveled for years (albeit getting stopped for adventures along the way), we know every detail of every minute of THEIR lives, and they're now so far away from her original clan home, that I don't see it being plausible to bring the two sons together for this meeting in 500 or 600 pages. Ayla hasn't even given birth to a 2nd son yet, and we have no information whatsoever on one moment of Durc's life during that time, nor how his life's events may have shaped the person he will be if this meeting ever takes place.If Ms. Auel's leaving that for us to imagine, then she's lost sight of what it means to \\"tell\\" a story. It almost appears she's setting herself up to write another bomb in what started out as an otherwise great series. Shame, shame."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting all this time for the Shelters of Stone to be released, I rushed out to get my copy full of anticipation of another fascinating weekend read. I ploughed through the book to the end, only to be really disappointed. Instead of a brief synopsis of the previous books, Jean refers constantly to them throughout the text. I'm assuming that anyone who buys Shelters of Stone is an avid Auel fan and will therefore have read the first four books several times.I found no new plots, story lines or snippets that we have not read in one of the other parts of the series. The constant reuse of all the title names of the members of the group became very tedious and I started skipping them !There is hardly even any build up of tension at the end to make the wait for the last book nail biting !I just hope that the final episode will be worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If you are looking for well-developed characters, an interesting storyline and fascinating background information - look elsewhere. I have struggled through 1/2 of this book and thus far have found it to be little more than tedious scenic descriptions (which run on for page after page) peppered with sexual encounters (which are so poorly written as to be laughable). I am returning this book to the library unfinished because I cannot bear to read one more page and am quite relieved that I did not waste money on this drivel. Unless you honestly enjoy books which use phrases like \\"tumescent manhood\\" and \\"pulsating nodule,\\" I would strongly suggest you avoid this book like the plague."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book doesn't seem to have been written by the same person as the first four (actually, Plains of Passage was even questionable) - my first thought was that Auel's son worked from her outline when she was sick. The writer seemed to have a completely different attitude towards the characters, even Ayla. I just reread the book this weekend for some reason, and now I remember why I never reread it yearly the way I do the first three. Where Plains of Passage was dull, Shelters of Stone was just bad.I was so disappointed in how bland Ayla seemed, while at the same time behaving uncharacteristically. While she showed \\"anger and belligerence\\", she didn't really shine through as being the same strong woman she has been as much as she acted petulantly. Then, she suddenly fit in so quickly with such a contentious and pretentious group of people as the Zelandonii - after we were told repeatedly for the length of three books how vehemently they hated the Clan and would find her to be unacceptable. That was just glossed over with a couple of pages of earnest discussion and a very uninteresting Marthona and Joharran subtly not discussing the topic openly. I got so sick of hearing about Marthona's lifted eyebrows and significant glances. The only thing that rang immediately true to me was Zelandoni's initial underestimation of Ayla's skills and knowledge. That did seem to fit with what we had learned of her and the Zelandonii. Otherwise, the majority of the book was rehashing the themes of Wolf, the firestone, and the horses over and over and over.I wanted to hear some of Hochaman's stories. I wanted more byplay between Ayla and Dalanar, and with Joplaya and Echozar. I wanted more of a reaction to Thonolan's death than the anti-climactic almost-selfconscious episode of \\"Willamar\\" staring into space with minor drama and some comforting tea, I wanted wailing and gnashing of teeth. I wanted family strife. It was annoying that Marona disappeared so conveniently for most of the story. I wanted to know more about her. I wanted to know what relation brukeval might have had with the mother of the neglected children. I wanted to hear about the history of the Zelandonii, but maybe that is waiting for Ayla's zelandoni training. I wanted to see Jondalar become more fleshed out as he resettled among his people, but even he wasn't much more developed than a piece of cardboard by the time he vanished during Ayla's delivery. My first thought was that both of them would have bucked whatever traditions or customs there were for him to attend the birth because they were so bonded and he has such a neurotic fear of losing her to some unknown danger and the constant insistence on it being \\"their\\" baby.Lastly, Willomar suddenly becoming Willamar just confused and irritated me. I simply don't understand how an editor let that happen.That being said, I was more than disappointed with Ayla's name for the baby - how silly and unlike Ayla can you get? I was expecting her to name her after Iza, or maybe Nezzie, or even someone from the Sharamudoi, or even doing something like Tholie in the Mammoth Hunters and coming up with a combination of a Clan name with a Zelandonii spelling, but not that ham-handed attempt to make the kid a Symbol of Ayla's Beliefs About Reproduction.I understand that these books are a monumental undertaking, and that was a part of what I loved about them since I was a child, the anthropology, the botany, the archaeology (though re-reading them now seems funny and quaint as a lot of what she based her storyline on has been re-evaluated), but this book was just not up to par. I understand that Ayla is supposed to represent the bigger picture, and that she's supposed to be larger than life. She's invented everything but the wheel and the kitchen sink. I'm sure she'll invent wheels for Whinney's travois, it hinted around her making Wolf a sled dog, she's already working on animal husbandry, and since she built the horses a trough, the sink can't be far behind. The amount of inventions and innovations she's made are starting to stretch the limits of credibility. The only thing about Ayla that stayed consistent was her love of learning and her longing to simply fit in and be like everyone else. Now she is simply so disgustingly perfect and crusading that I just want to ignore her. Her sudden \\"revelation\\" about her power at the very end just seemed to be hastily tacked-on and completely dishonest.I have since read on different fan sites that book Six, intended to be the last, might be followed by Seven, and I can't help but wonder if the lukewarm, puzzled, and unhappy response of her fans might have anything to do with it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was so disappointed in this book that were supposed to be the last in the series. The endless repetition was enough to drive me insane. How could this book ever have been published? Was it only for the sake of money that could be made out of the sale of this book, because everyone who followed the series was waiting in anticipation for it. I still can't believe a person who wrote Clan of the Cave Bears, Valley of the Horses etc, could give her readers something like this......????"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been reading the Earth's Children series since it came out, and have enjoyed the story of Ayla for the most part. Yes, the endless passages about flint napping techniques and steppe topography would get tedious, but there was a story around it all that was impelling enough to get through all of that. Ayla is an interesting character in that despite all the tragedy and hardships she goes through, she still manages to be brilliant and perfect. Ok, so that's an unrealistic character trait, but, c'mon, the whole concept of one cro-magnon woman advancing civilization by huge leaps and bounds demands a suspension in belief anyways. Back when the books would come out more frequently, my family and I would often joke about when in the series Ayla would invent the wheel, sailing ships, and agriculture.Which may be part of the reason for my disappointment in this book. Nothing extraordinary happens in over 600 pages of ad nauseum repetition. I unexpectedly found Shelters of Stone in my local library shortly after the death of Kurt Vonnegut Jr. As his quotes were fresh on my mind, I was constantly reminded of his rules of writing that include every sentence must somehow advance the story. I was aghast at how often the same thing was said over and over again in this book. The inane repetition over how the animals were domesticated, or how the fire stones were discovered, or, my God, the third time the Mother's Song was included in the story, I had to start skipping forward just to see if anything happens in this book. Which, aside from some births and deaths, does not.I will read the next book in the series, for the same reasons I read the painful later books in the Dune series - I can't just abandon my earlier investment of time and interest. I can only hope that Shelters of Stone is setting up something wonderful to come."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"While I feel it is a marked improvement over Plains of Passage, there was almost nothing new in The Shelters of Stone. As a reader, I'm far more interested in what happened to Broud's Clan (abandoned after the first book) than the Zelandoni, Jondalar's people who unfortunately (for readers) are among the least interesting cultural groups introduced. It almost seems that Shelters of Stone was meant for someone with no familiarity with Jean Auel's previous work. I hope Book 6 is better and I pray there will be more concentration on Durk and Broud's clan."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I came to read reviews on this book out of curiousity and have to agree with those who have posted that this was a disappointment. I greedily read the first four books in this series and waited and waited and waited for this one to come out. As soon as it did, I ordered a hardback and (as another reviewer noted) have since regretted spending the money on that when a used paperback would have been sufficient -- hell, even checking it out from the library would have sufficed.I have considered that perhaps since there had been such a long span of time between books 4 and 5 -- perhaps I was \\"hyped\\" with the prospect of \\"the rest of the story\\". I have also considered that shortly before this book's release I went back and read the first 4 again (I really did enjoy them!) as a refresher...perhaps this book \\"seemed\\" repetitive to me.I have considered these possibilities...but I recognize that it is simply me trying very hard to find a way to say this book had merit.This book was a disappointment. If Auel had not repeated what she had already written in the earlier books, this book might have been only consisted of a couple of hundred pages -- and the new info alone wasn't a very engaging read anyway. It's hard for me to feel good about giving a bad review -- but in this case I simply can't help it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"to explain how cheated I felt by this book! I actually bought the hardback as soon as it was out because I am such a fan of all of the books in this series. NOTHING HAPPENS in this book! It really could have been 10 pages long to get the whole plot of what happens. It actually starts out pretty good...there are the descriptions of her new home and the introduction of a new group of people, which was interesting, and there was even enough character development at the start to keep me excited. But then....nothing! The conflict between Ayla and the ex-fiance of Jondalar could have been interesting, but instead, nothing happens! The book is filled up with more repetition than I have EVER seen in any novel. Where was the editor on this project!?! I'm not exaggerating when I say that you hear the same descriptions and anecdotes 3, 4, 5 times throughout this thing. I unfortunately read every page thinking, hoping and praying something would happen. But guess what? NOTHING EVER DOES!I am giving it 2 stars for the first few chapters, which were interesting because I loved learning where Ayla and Jondalar ended up, but I think this rating is generous. Save your money and re-read one of the others in this series - you'll be much happier for it!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear was a remarkable beginning to Auel's series. The Valley of Horses continued with Ayla's struggle to survive, ending with finally meeting one of the Others. The Mammoth Hunters starts turning into prehistoric soap opera, introducing another man to compete for Ayla's affection, while Jondular mopes around. The slide started there. The Plains of Passage was nothing more than traveling and sex scenes. Now we have the Shelters of Stone. I guess I thought that after the Plains, Auel took 12 years to bring back some drama and plot, and improve the series. Turns out she must have had writer's block, and the publisher obviously forced her to get something, anything, worked into a manuscript. The editor did a terrible job. This book should have been 400 pages instead of 750. I had anticipated this book, but now I think it's only worth reading out of curiosity and as a bridge to the next and final story, which I will probably be too old and decrepit to read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Following Ayla and Jondalar through the Earth's Children saga has been a fascinating experience in imagine and fact. However, Shelters of Stone is a major disappointment in the series--it is repetitious, ponderous and at times downright boring. Ms. Auel repeated stories and experiences so often from the other books, that one does not need to read them now. Her introductions rivaled the begats in the Bible. Do we honestly need complete introductions each time for each character? There was very little accomplished in this book aside from rehashing the other four books. Yes, a couple of events occurred, but there were no surprises generated emotionally or in the plot line. Ayla and Jondalar are set up as the inventor of many important creations from how to make fire to sewing to using animals for human need. In the next book will she invent farming and the wheel? I don't mind a slow read if there is new information and a plot that has some advancement. This book could have been enhanced with better editing (like taking out about 200-300 pages), a tighter plot and new information rather than rehashing old. How many times did we need to know that Broud forced Ayla and it wasn't pleasures? We got that information in Books 1-4. I was thankful tho that this book did not dwell on the sexual (pleasures) aspect as much as Valley and Mammoth did--since it seemed way overdone in those volumes. However, I would have liked to have seen a deeping of the characters emotional psyches. And, if Ms. Auel couldn't do this, it would have been nice to have explored some of the peripherial characters and their personalities or more information about the history and the artifacts of the era.This is worth reading if you enjoy thinking about how we developed and invented items (like fire, sewing, herbal concoctions) that changed our lives and set us, as humans, on a path of greater development than Clan members. It is also worth reading if you have missed her other books. However, if you have read her previous four books and are looking for new information, a definitive plot, and additional character development, then this book is sadly lacking and will be a major disappointment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"\\"Shelters of Stone\\" has a great legacy to live up to, and unfortunately, it falls short of the first four books in the series.After the previous novels--each of which told a story that was an epic in and of itself--this sequel (the penultimate in the series) feels claustrophobic, small, and insignificant. The first 3/4 of the novel literally covers a span of no more than a few weeks, with far too much repetition of previous plot points and tiresome revisiting of similar scenes, replayed under slightly different circumstances.Ayla demonstrates her new firestones at least three times before different audiences; the method of presentation and impact on the audience never varies. Even love scenes between Ayla and Jondalar are deja vu all over again, feeling \\"prescribed\\" rather than natural. Oops, it's been 125 pages...time for a paint-by-numbers interlude in the meadow!After a sweeping Journey across hundreds of miles and multiple cultures in the first four novels, this book opens as Ayla and Jondalar return home. The conflicts of the previous novels were on a grand scale; life and death, love and loss, old ways vs. change, Clan vs. Others. But in \\"Shelters of Stone,\\" the biggest problems are frustratingly mundane. Will Ayla's new in-laws like her?...Will she be able to overcome the petty pranks of Jondalar's ex, the pretty but [grouchy] Marona?... Will Jondalar's father Dalanar show up in time for the wedding?... Will Jondalar's first love, Zolena, be a problem?...This book is, despite its 750-page heft, an exceedingly small story. New material comprises perhaps only a fourth of the entire book; the rest is rehashing, revisiting, and even reprinting entire passages from the earlier books. It's as though, having gotten Ayla and Jondalar safely home, Auel is at a complete loss about what to do with them.Auel has created characters that are far too compelling, complex, and dynamic to saddle them with the inconsequential, mundane, domestic details they are forced to walk through, in excruciating detail, in this novel.I have great hopes that the sixth novel will return to the scale and grandiosity of the previous books in the series. (And frankly, I also hope that if the love scenes between Ayla and Jondalar continue to be as perfunctory and predictable as they were in this novel, they'll be left out entirely in the final book of the series.)With precious little \\"new\\" in the way of plot or character development, and very little to recommend it to readers who are not already fans of the series, I sincerely hope Auel will regain the fullness of her voice and vision in the next and final book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"While I certainly agree that Jean Auel's writing is repetitious and badly in need of a good editor, and don't understand how her publishers failed her so badly, reviewers who see only that aspect miss the point of the series, as do those who complain about Ayla's mythic status. This *is* a myth, carefully developed through the series starting with \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" to show how circumstances, time, and distance combine to evolve a mythic figure out of a talented but still very human person.The great, and enduring value of the series is (1) its portrayal of the 35, 000 year-old world when Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal overlapped, the great art of the cave painting and ivory carvings was created, and human ingenuity was starting to make itself felt, and (2) the psychological and cultural interactions of very different mind-sets. Auel condenses the historic record of human invention into one short period for good reason: it helps to convey the difficulties and importance of such creative and flexible approaches in a world where humans were few and weak.To read these works as you would a realistic novel about today's world is to deprive yourself of a rich - and enriching - imaginative experience. If you need realism/naturalism then don't real Auel. Perhaps it is best to classify her work as historic fantasy, or magical realism, or even surrealism."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel has been my favorite author since I read her first book at the tender age of twelve. I have read and reread the first four books in the series many, many times in the past 14 years. I religiously checked the websites for any gossip about when the new book would be out, and ordered an advance copy. And then I got a BIG disappointment, about 700 pages of disppointment to be more specific. This book lacked any of the charm of the earlier books. I don't know why either. The subject matter (meeting the in-laws, the birth of a child, a long awaited marriage) are interesting topics, and Auel has done much more with less in the past. The marriage and birth were briefly skimmed over, while the geologic lay of the terrain was examined in excruciating detail. And then she names the poor child \\"Jonayla\\" (a mix of the mother and father's names-Jondalar and Ayla)...just one more example of the complete lack of effort put into this novel. It leaves me wondering if Auel really threw this together to finish out the series. Whatever the case, I agree that if you feel compelled to read this as part of the series, borrow it from the library. And keep your fingers crossed that Auel gets back a little of the old magic on the next one!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I, like most others, have been anxiously awaiting this book. As one of the other reviewer's suggested, I too appreciate Auel's obvious effort in the researching of this book. However, nothing happens! In over 700 pages of text, we get repetition and excrutiating detail. Auel's last book led us to believe that we would encounter a major conflict between Ayla's two sons in the next book ....I don't want to say anything bad about this book either and thought that maybe since it had been so long since I had read the others, that I had forgotten about all the detail. I had to read the other reviews for validation, this book is LONG and monotonous and the story itself is weak. I read the entire series because of Ayla's amazing strength and her ability to overcome. She overcomes very little in this book and actually, the story seems to be an afterthought to the research. The conversations and feelings are written in a choppy way and the book doesn't seem to flow at all. One minute Ayla is doing something or feeling something interesting and the next we are back to the description of the landscape or that extremely long poem. There is also A LOT of repitition of the other stories in this book. Not only does she repeat the other stories but she actually repeats things that happened in the other books over and over in this one.I will probably read the final book in the series but I hope Auel has the sense to read what her readers think about this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelters of Stone is Jean Auel's Pleistocene Utopia. It is a beautiful, though somewhat simplistic world, and I think it can do us considerable good to live there a little while. Ayla has traveled an unimaginable distance to reach the fertile region of present-day France where the people of her lover have built their world. And so, from the time of leaving the Valley of Horses, we are led to anticipate the land of the Zelandonii as the goal at the end of the journey. And that is what it is.Auel has created a just, harmonious society of good people, where there is healing, caring, co-operation, mutual respect, sharing, plenty and love. This is a society built on a framework of sacred customs, a hierarchical society where leaders, temporal and spiritual, cherish the people and hold their good paramount, and where the people respect and align with the wisdom and guidance of their leaders. It is a society where having no self-control is frowned on, where jealousy and selfishness are frowned on, where there is freedom of a kind so attuned to the greater good that it fosters a joyous uprush of artistic creativity and scientific inventiveness. All of which Auel describes for us in the kind of detail that brings us right in, so that we, too, become part of that world.Possibly it is because the detail is so very rich that it took me a while to realize that not much is actually happening. There is very little plot, certainly of the discord, danger, conflict and then resolution variety that came before, and that may come again, later. And how such a wise and well-ordered society would deal with situations of discord, with crime, with trespass, with any of the other inevitable difficulties that would come when two hundred people live together in a cave -- even a very spacious one -- is never addressed. It is hinted at for the future, by means of the envious musings of a handful of the Zelandonii who do not wish Ayla and Jondalar well and who seem to be biding their time to do something about it. But how such a society would decide it should justly deal with such people is never addressed.The Shelters of Stone is a book about conflict deferred, and seems to be there, essentially, as a bridge to the final book. There is a sense of moving toward the true conflict and resolution to come, and a series of tantalizing hints about how all that will take shape. But this next-to-last book of the series is like a day spent at home, which doesn't really go anywhere, and after a while I found myself missing the tension and vitality of a stronger plot. Or any plot. I missed, too, genuinely interesting, strong male figures. Jondalar has become almost decorative, and no other man emerges with the compelling presence, stature or significance of Creb or Mamut, the two holy men of earlier volumes.But, most of all, I miss the Clan, the Neanderthals. The signs are that we will see them again, but the possility of having to wait another twelve years -- the time it took Auel to write the present book -- is something I don't like to think about too much. I'm not as young as I used to be and I made up my mind that, before I go, I would find out who Deep Throat was, and what ever happened to Ayla's son Durc.Auel is already working on the final book now, and I have the feeling she knew where she wanted to end up right from the start. The final volume of the Earth's Children saga will, I think, make up abundantly for whatever disappointments there may have been in this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I Loved the first books. I waited a long time for this book. It is a major disappointment. Why does the author assume that no one has read any of the previous books? I'd like a new story instead of just a rewrite of the old ones. The pages of introductions between characters are boring. Can't Auel think of any new stories? She starts a few then just leaves the reader dangling. Ayla and Jondalar and even Wolf become tedious and uninteresting. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been an avid reader of Jean Auel's Earth Children Series for some time. I anxiously purchased this book as soon as it came out - ...this book does not live up to the first four of the series. It is so different that I have even told people that half the time it reads as if someone else wrote it. Whereas the other four books are full adventure, interesting plots, and passion, this book has none of any of those things. I thought even the story was lacking in this book: predictable, dull, and flat. If it was my first introduction to the series, I wouldn't have read half the book.Most of the book painfully reviews past events, and repeats the same things several times. Save your money - don't buy this book. You will do better to stop after Plains of Passage - you will be happier with series then."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting so long for this book, I was disappointed on the reuse of previous information from the other books. Yes, they needed to recount their adventures but it seemed to make up the majority of the book. The only really key new theme was the relationship between Ayla and the Zelandonia and even that wasn't in the depth and detail that situations in previous books were presented. I found this book rather \\"fluffy\\" compared to the others and don't think Ms Auel was really into writing it. Furthermore, it ending with such an obvious \\"wait for the next one\\" it didn't seem complete. I felt each previous book told its own complete story even though it led you to expect another."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have to agree with some of the reviews of this book, BUT I LOVE this character and so I will avidly read ANYTHING or any book about her...Ayla IS woman...but I DID find the book tedious at times with all the long introductions of people and all their titles and I actually don't care all that much about the socal order of the Zelandoni People........BUT will grab the next book as soon as it becomes available...Ayala is an old friend and I will stick with her to the very bitter end, to the death of Whinney and Wolf and perhaps even Jondular or Ayala herself...is she EVER going to be reunited with Durc??If I can say antying about this book, I WILL say that I am glad that I did not read this one first and so have read them all in the order in which they were written. This was NOT the best..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously because I am an archaeology major. Auel brings the mundane to life with great detail and knowledge. I was truly swept away within this pre-historic world. But as a novel it lacks action. I do like the way the characters are moving and hope that her next novel will be heavier on plot."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I found this book to be mediocre. I loved the introduction of the new characters, but was disappointed to find that the action, romance, and excitement I was used to from previous Earth's Children books was definitely lacking. Upon completion of the book, I just sat there thinking, \\"is this it?\\"There were parts of the book where I skipped a few paragraphs to avoid reading the same stories that have been told countless times. The same goes for descriptions of the landscape, which I found to be verbose. Some retelling is necessary in a sequel to remind readers of past novels, but it was overdone here.Even though I was disappointed with this book, I do look forward to Jean Auel's next novel. If it is one thing this novel accomplished, it was to introduce new characters and set the stage for another book. I hope the next one lives up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am not sure why, but Sandra Burr has changed the voices of the characters, especially Ayla. Ayla now has a Scottish accent, which sounds really hokey. Otherwise, the book is very good."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This MIGHT have been an OK book if it had been half the length! Way way way too many descriptions of the rivers, the shores, the stones, the caves etc etc etc. It reads like a **very boring** geological textbook half the time! Hardly what you would call page-turning fiction! We all know that Ms. Auel has done extensive research for these novels, but I really don't want to be reminded of that on every page. Fiction is about plot, character development; not tedious drivel describing the physical landscape.Also, the book is very badly edited. There are so many repetitious parts--how many times does Joharran have to ask Jondalar if he'll teach them how to use and make the spear-throwers!??! Come on!Once again, an author got lazy and is riding on the coattails of her previous success. I won't bother reading any more of Jean Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Wow, it wasn't a bad a read as the others would have you think. It is very descriptive on life and customs and exsistance more than the Ayla/Jondalar story line. Her research of the time is amazing. Very admirable.Anyway, it's fantasy, it's fiction! So what if Ayla is \\"perfect\\" and discovers everything and Jondalar is a sex object. Get lost in another time, away from real life for a while! Isn't that what a book is supposed to do?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"So glad I didn't waste money in buying this book when the library had it for free. But still, I felt myself bored in reading it and wishing something, ANYthing interesting would happen. It was built up to look as if Marona or Brukeval would cause discord in Ayla's perfect world, but alas, nothing ever came of that. And each time Ayla met someone new I would just cringe knowing that ALL the titles were going to be repeated yet AGAIN. How tiresome did THAT become?! At least it wasn't AS repetitive as The Mammoth Hunters, but I still could have done without reading about all of Ayla's past in detail, over and over and over. And in this book, just as in the other books since Clan of the Cave Bear I was hoping Ayla would go back to the Clan to see Durc and to truly bring Broud down a notch or two, but didn't happen in this book either. This book was a big Y-A-W-N."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Pointless conversation, facts laid out in laundry list form, inconsistent characterization, interminable passages of description...this is the most self-indulgent book I've read in a while. Maybe that's a pitfall of success.I couldn't finish it and I didn't care what happened. If Jean Auel's fans (and I am one) aren't disappointed, they darn well should be."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read alot of reviews that trashed the book, but I read it anyways because I was a big fan of the the previous four books. Auel wrote this book, for people who didn't read the other 4 and that is unfortunate. I don't need constant recaps of what happened before and I skimmed over those sections. I also got tired of the very detailed descriptions of the landscape and skim over those too. I was more interested in the story of Ayla and Jondalar than the landscape. It was a good read, (with skimming of the dull parts) and I read it in one weekend. I will buy the 6th book to finish the story, but I do wish Auel will write book six knowing that the reader has made it through the other 5. STOP RETELLING THINGS WE ALREADY KNOW! Having said that, I still enjoyed the book... but it could have been better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The repetition of the earlier books is justified for those who haven't read them, or don't remember what they read 12 years ago. The repetition within the book is not; nor are the ad nauseum descriptions of rocks, plants, hills, valleys, etc. Are the number of words in the book used in calculating what Jean Auel was paid? probably, and she knew it. The story line, while stretched out and left hanging, was good. The presentation of the social lives, and struggles of the people Ayla is to live with is interesting, if not exciting. But, the whole thing could have been comfortably compressed into a couple hundred pages as the first few chapters of something a lot better...like what we all hope book 6 will give us."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I started reading the Earth's Children Series, as many people did, and became entraced with the story of Ayla of No People. As the books progressed, for me, Ayla's story became more like a real-life history/archeology lesson. Some of Auel's descriptions are rather involved and long-winded, but every time I reread, I find some little new tidbit that I'd overlooked and that makes the series fresh for me each time. I found the series to be a very logical, thought-out \\"recounting\\" of that time period, even to the littlest of details of how people disposed of human waste. For me, this book, and the entire series is probably one of the best \\"social histories\\" I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"good GRIEF! and WHEW! I thought it was just me, but this book and Plains of Passage are horrid. Even the reader for Plains of Passage on the Books on Tape version was barely tolerable. What happened to the story telling...this is fiction, not Prehistoric History of Europe 101 overandoverandoverandOVER.Some detail, good...as much detail as these books have (and it's the same in BOTH books again and again and again...we get it, you did a LOT of research), not necessary. And the animals have no personality any more.BLECH! Maybe Jean Auel burned out after Mammoth Hunters, produced a mediocre Plains of Passage and just needed a break. Well, take another before finishing off the series or don't finish at all. I won't buy another one of these."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like so many people, I waited eleven years for this book, and I can honestly say it wasn't worth it. There are several key faults with The Shelters of Stone--1) I find it hard to believe Jean Auel wrote it. The book is completely lacking the energy and earnestness of the previous four books, and it reads as if Ms. Auel jobbed it out to a broke college student. 2) Too much repetition. There should be just enough info from previous books to tease new readers into buying them, not so much that returning readers (the majority of buyers) skip over pages and chapters at a time. 3) The Zelandonii are boring and close-minded people. The Mamutoi, Sharamudoi, Losadunai, Lanzadonii, and even the S'Armunai were far more interesting, and all of them were willing to accept Ayla's healing ability, while she was basically told she couldn't be a healer among the Zelandonii unless she devoted herself to become a priestess. Even the characters who should have been interesting, like the town drunk and the jilted fiance, were all one-dimensional and their stories didn't go anywhere. 4) There was no plot. While it was always a stretch that Ayla would be the superwoman who would domesticate animals, invent needles, discover an easy way to make fire, etc., at least something was always happening. The Shelters of Stone was largely a recap of old stories, with a couple of lackluster new vignettes added in. Basic story--Ayla meets Jondalar's people, they get married, she has a baby, and Whinney has a baby. The new elements of the story could have been told in about 100 pages. 5) There was no introduction of the Clan. With the setup from The Plains of Passage, I expected a story dealing with relations between the Cro Magnons and Neanderthals, yet there was just some vague talk about how the Clan might be angry at the Zelandonii for stealing their caves. Overall, I'm very sorry I wasted my money on this wretched book, and I'll either borrow number six from the library or wait until it's on the dollar table at the bookstore."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read her other 4 books in this series, and I fell in love with the characters and read with gusto! There is much detail, lots of in-depth explanations of life in that time - and I felt as if I were there with them - thru the exciting times she described! I truely hope she will write many more, using these characters , and others. I feel as if there are many more stories out there to be told about Ayala and Jondalar and their exciting lives with all the innovative things they were capable of devising! I wish the books had gone on and on - I hated for them to be over - and I await the next ones eagerly!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"On the whole, I enjoyed the Earth's Children series so far. I agree with the critique that Ayla is a bit hard to believe sometimes-she's an extremely beautiful and universally loved super-genius. Does anyone else get the impression that, if Ayla were born thousands of years later, she'd be an honor roll cheerleader and Jondalar would be the stud of the football team? And don't get me started on the boring sex scenes. At least Auel stopped using the phrase \\"furry mound\\" a few books back.I found \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" (and the rest of the series, except \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" which was fantastic) to be a tedious read. I won't pretend it's not. Frankly, Auel's editor needs to tell her that the word \\"did\\" should not be used as much as it is and to lay off the commas. At times, the text seems more like a lecture of prehistoric flora and fauna for the non-academic set-which is a really cool idea, but it disrupts the flow of the text.So, you're probably saying, much like my friends do, \\"If you're so displeased with the books, why bother reading them?\\" In short, I can't. Despite Auel's often awkward writing, I grew to genuinely want to know what happens to Ayla (and Jondalar, to an extent). Sure, Ayla's pretty much the prehistoric prom queen and Jondalar is her eternally devoted man of her hearth; but the book is fiction, and I'm willing to overlook the main characters' impossible perfection just so I can see what else is in store.I liked Ayla's spunky personality and her clashes with the Clan in \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" so much I slammed down money to read the rest of the series. That, and Auel hides some tidbits of insightful social observation (cf. the Others' treatment of flatheads/Clan and taking their land to Western colonialism). Interestingly, Auel uses Ayla's super-genius overachiever character to highlight feminist issues, particularly how women are sometimes asked to make choices between having a family and having a career. Should Ayla remain mated or train with the zelandonia? Should she do both? Interestingly, one of the objections I mentioned earlier (Ayla's extreme beauty) was only introduced into the series after she left the Clan and found \\"her\\" people. Could it be Auel's lesson on the cultural basis of beauty?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Wow, may I just say this: This series has been hard enough to get through (I got the audiobooks free from a friend), but now it's intolerable. Remember how in the early 90's Tina Turner all of a sudden had this weird brit/european accent? For no apparent reason? Well, the same reader has done books 2-5, and now- in book 5, Ayla has this weird accent. She rolls her r sounds and has this broken language deal going on. Whatever. Like the storylines aren't lame enough, now it sounds awful, too.I'm so tired of their sex life by now, Ayla certainly must be, too. Of course, she is the queen of the instant orgasm, so maybe not. Lucky girl, I guess. Anyway, that's my review- no need to review the story because it's the same as all the others. But to change the entire speech and cadence of the main character's voice is just ridiculous. What crap."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have never seen so much padding in a book, ever. It is worse than General Hospital that my mother watched for so many years. My feeling is that chapters were given to hired writers while Jean Auel was on vacation and the writers weren't very good. I think Jean's readers deserve something much better.Carol"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think a lot of people are giving this book a bad rap for no reasons.I read the first four about ten years ago, and have been eagerly awaiting the next installment. It turned out to be just as good as I expected.I did expect there to be a great deal of telling about the place that Ayla and Jondalar spent so long getting to. It was necessary for Jean to very clearly describe to us the people, customs and setting that we had finally gotten to. Ayla's first months were full of almost constant movement that lasted most of the book and then accelerated towards the end.Personally, I could have had more story and less backstory and description, but I fully understand the reasoning for it and the book stands alone as a result of it. Truly a marvelous work, I would recommend it to anyone and can hardly wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"\\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is the 5th book in the \\"Earth's Children Series\\". In this book, the story of Ayla and Jondalar continues.Ayla is a young Cro-Magnon cavewoman raised by Neanderthals, who are despised by the Cro-Magnon. Her story begins for us in \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\", where Auel tells us about Ayla's life with the Neanderthals. Personally,I didn't like that book (Ayla was very unhappy, and she wasn't treated well by the people who raised her when her parents died, except maybe for Iza and Creb), but I know that it might be good to read it before the others, as it provides a good setting for the story.In \\"The Valley of Horses\\" (2nd book in the series) Ayla lives alone after being expelled from her Clan (she was cursed and pronounced dead!!!). There she meets Jondalar, a handsome Cro- Magnon she saves from death (read it, and then tell me what you think about the idea of having a lion called \\"Baby\\" as a pet !!! :) ).In the third book of the series, \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\", Ayla and Jondalar meet more people like them (something completely normal to Jondalar, but very strange to Ayla, who had thought she was an anomaly). Ayla's powers as a healer are tested (as it is her relationship with Jondalar), and she also earns respect because of her shamanistic and hunting abilities. She overcomes the prejudices aroused because she was reared by the \\"flathead\\" (Neanderthals), and end up with the affection of her new friends.Despite liking the mamutoi, Ayla and Jondalar eventually start again they journey to Jondalar's home. Their adventures are told to us in the 4th book of these series, \\"The Plains of passage\\".Finally, we have this book, \\"The shelters of stone\\", where Ayla and Jondalar arrive to Jondalar's home. We are told many things, for example what does Ayla have to cope with in a new environment. However, on the whole the zelandoniis gave her a good welcome (except some that are not really important, asMarona, Jondalar's jilted fianc&eacute;e, who he didn't love enough to marry). Ayla has to deal again with prejudice against the clan, but she is able to do so (in some degree due to Jondalar's love for her, in some degree due to her guts and the respect she commands for her peculiar abilities as a healer and regarding animals).I really like all these books (except for the first). Even though some reviewers hate the fact that Auel gives (and repeats) too many details regarding the period (she is an anthropologist), I don't particularly mind that. I believe that gives these books and aura of authenticity they wouldn't have otherwise. In my opinion, the \\"Earth's Children Series\\" is highly original, and gives everybody an opportunity to \\"visit\\" the Ice age (I'm quite eager to read the 6th book!!!).On the other hand, the price for this book (the 5th) is just too high, so my recommendation would be: read it, but try to wait for the paperback :)"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the Clan of the Cave Bear and the next couple of books Ms. Auel wrote when they first came out. I remember really enjoying the first couple books, can't quite remember the next one,however this is the first ones I've bought since those first books.I found The Plains of Passage and The shelters of Stone extremely tedious, with long drawn out geographical descriptions where fewer words would have given the picture just fine. The repetition was tiresome on so many fronts! And I have to say the very long drawn out, descriptive sexual encounters with Jondalar were offensive to say the least! I don't remember that sort of writing in the first books. I never have gotten a kick out of reading about other peoples sexual exploits! It's porn in writing and just wasn't necessary to the overall idea of the story. I found myself skipping over many, many pages throughout the books because of all these reasons.There were so many little mistakes in herbal uses and many of their little inventions that would never have worked the way she described them. And I could not believe the \\"soup bowls\\" being lifted and carried on horses!! Many far fetched things going on there! Maybe she's not a rider but the way she described the making of the \\"water proof bowls\\" (with hot soup no less), hefting them up on the horse, with the amount it would have taken to feed the amount of people she described was nothing short of nonsense and very funny!I hope I can get Amazon to refund me for the one I haven't read yet!

If Shelters of Stone was her first book, I would have never read the other four. In this book, Ms. Auel had several storylines that she could have developed but never did. I kept waiting for something catastrophic to happen to either Ayla, Jondalar, Wolf or the horses. Nothing ever did. Ms. Auel's discriptions of most scenes, mountains, rivers, etc. were overdone and drawnout which became time wasting and boring....page fillers. By purchasing this book, I felt I was just making my monetary offering to Ms. Auel to support her next efforts of the trials and tribulations of Ayla and friends. Ms. Auel, please make your next book have some depth and with pitfalls that we are all challenged with from day to day, not some fairyland that you have presented for Ayla. After I read the final page, I thought this book reminded me of a favorite song of mine sung by Peggy Lee. \\"Is That All There Is.\\""},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This was the worst book Auel has ever written. The characters where ill defined, and nothing really much happened. Ayla had her baby! Big whoop. The whole story was basically about how Great and beautiful Ayla was and how handsome Jondalar was. Even the sex scenes were beginning to be all the same. As i mentioned before, Auel did a terrible job on defining her characters. I never once felt like i knew any of the other characters in her book. She didn't tell enough about Brukeval and his problems, and that could have been great.She didn't get enough time to make any friends with the other women either. She made it seem also that Ayla and Jondalar were the perfect man and woman. Ayla had so many great inventions, she could talk to animals, she was the prettiest woman ever! Oh come on! there is only so much one woman could be, and there is no woman that is so beautiful that everyone is just besotted with her. And they made it seem like she had special powers or something. She didn't! Auel also repeated herself in this book. It was like; we know who Ayla is, we don't need her to recite all her titles again. Auel probably spent have the book introducing people. It was absolutely ridicoulous. No one is that gorgeous, no one is that smart, and no one is that lucky. If Jean M. Auel already hadn't been a world famous aurthor, this book would have never hit the shelves. This was definetly not a book to wait six years on. And the people who did waste six years waiting were badly disappointed. From the way this book was written, i'd say Auel spent a hurried month on it, and not the six years traviling to Europe for \\"research\\" like she said."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on \\"how amazing\\" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" and \\"Valley of Horses.\\" (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is boring - the previous were exciting.This one reminds me of Stephen King and his repetitive writing(all in the same book).Could have been only half as many pages and more interesting."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I can't even get through this book. It IS and ISN'T like the first 4 - it IS because it's the same thing over and over, it isn't because I can enjoy \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" in 24 hours and I can't make it more than 1/2 way through this book after a month. The familiar characters don't GROW at all. After 12 years, despite her illness, Auel dropped the spear thrower on this one. I can't get a sense for the setting despite the nauseating detail. I skipped ahead to read the ending. Nothing new there, either. This book covers about 7 months of time - all the rest covered a year or more and in a lot less pages.The writing is not what I expect from Auel - at one time the POV shifted no less than 3 times in ONE SENTENCE. Omniscient, yes, but with what must be 50 new characters, most of which are forgetable and whose names are alike (and an INDEX in the back to keep them straight, no less!) we could at least keep POV shifts to a single paragraph for confusion's sake. This story is TOLD, not SHOWN.Sorry, but if you like the series, you will want to read the book for loyalty's sake, but if you are new to her stuff, read \\"Clan\\" and stop there. Maybe read Vally of Horses and Mammoth Hunters. Those 3 and you can skip Plains of Passage and Shelters of Stone.

Many passages in the book are repetitive and long (like giving everyone's full cave name every time, and that ENDLESS Earth Mother hymn, as well as the scenes where Ayla grooms the horses, greets Wolf, Wolf greets her--all the same, repeated ad infinitum). Readers are not stupid and would have gotten the point with one or two mentions of these things...instead, the reading level of the book is at about the 5th or 6th grade, and one feels slow and dumb reading things over and over. The sex scenes are gratuitous and excessive, lowering this book to the level of a Harlequin romance, instead of the \\"educated fiction\\" Auel intends. The ending is abrupt and somewhat unprofessional, and leaves the reader feeling as if a door has been slammed in one's face. This book could have used extensive and judicious editing, and Auel could have used all the left over pages to finish the story of Ayla so we don't have to wait for (or buy) another book. I don't know that I will. My recommendation: go to the library, borrow the book, and read the last couple of chapters only. That should give you enough idea of what's going on to decide if you want to wait for the next book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've read all of Ms. Auel's novels, and have loved every one...until now. I kept waiting for this to get better, and I kept paging through, and it never got better. The story was boring, and insulting in it's simplicity (I felt as if I was reading an archeological textbook for 4th graders), there was no excitement as was the case in other books, and the ending was ridiculous. I actually paged through past the last paragraph, thinking that I was missing part of the book. Talk about dropping off in the middle of nowhere. The only saving grace about the ending was just that - it was the ending! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. It's a waste of [money]."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited, like everyone else, for the next installment in this series and didn't hold off until a sale or for a discount.I should have.Either Ms. Auel fired her editor or, like too many of her experts, he died during her extended hiatus.How many times must we be told about Ayla using the night-basket because she had to urinate more often due to her pregnancy? How many times did we need reminded that Ayla was frightened to become a Zeladoni? Other examples of this repetitive writing are numerous. The book could have been cut by 15% and not suffered - probably improved.I hope the sixth book is better edited and Ms. Auel tightens her craft. Yes, I will buy the next one and hope for the best."},{"Title":"Subspace Explorers","review":"If you're silly enough to allow any deeper meaning for this space opera, then bear with me.

The other-cubed bad guys, this being the Cold War at its searing coldest, are the Soviets of New Russia, and that says all that matters.Of course, in the midst of all these baddies, we have the good guys, a mere ninety planets or so against these schemers against all that's good, free, democratic, and based on hard currency.

And, although some of the weaker sex are almost the equal of the square-jawed men in many respects, that highest level of super-psi-something or other is a mens club, ladies not admitted. The females have their own figures of merit, though, and not just the classic three measurements that summarize everything a fratboy wants to know. No, because they are such potent beings, these women seem to consider the \\"cat in heat\\" as the highest exemplar of their womanly values.

Sci fi Hall of Fame EE Doc Smith is one of my favorite 1930s 1940s authors.His epic Lensmen series is one of the best sci fi series of all time 5 star plus and his Skylark series is 5 star. 40 plus years ago I read Subspace Explorers but forgot the story. I bought this book again to read and add to our family library.The book starts out with a first officer on a space liner that is almost totally destroyed. Only 9 survive. 4 of the nine are killer mobsters that threaten the two officers, a genius multiple PHD man, and have eyes on the two beautiful women ( one with psychic powers used to find oil on other planets and a debutante). The mobsters are defeated and killed. The crewman get the liner limping to a landing on a planet, send a transmission and are rescued. A duel marriage between the two officers and the beautiful women is performed on the crippled liner in space. Both women get pregnant and have very long pregnancies due to the time difference in sub space. The children, a boy and a girl and born with growing great psychic powers.All the grown 5 people find they have psychic powers and eventually learn telepathy and different psychic abilities and find a rich planet with lots of Uranium, the most precious metal used for the initiation of spaceships FTL drive. Many more psychic ability people are found and introduced to the new organization used for Subspace Exploration.I won't go too much deeper into the book and ruin it for you.. Just say there are conglomerate gigantic corporations such as Plastics controlling a secret slave planet making goods for Earth and her sister worlds, Galactic Metals , a Diary and Meat conglomerate and others working on other worlds, highly efficient and automated. Also there is a Communist government and other governments involved.EE Doc Smith's Subspace Explorers did not have much technology in it,ancient/outdated handheld weapons such as .45 autos, lots of mental powers, lots of conglomerate structure and secret government goings on. Also a huge space battle and liberation of a slave planet. Very little frightening aliens.This was better than average sci fi but not as good as Smith's EPIC Lensmen series and very good Skylark series. An OK book to have in your family library and Sci Fi Hall of Fame EE Doc Smith collection. 3 1/3 stars."},{"Title":"Subspace Explorers","review":"Subspace Explorers, by Edgar E. Smith, is a very different book from most of the science fiction written by E.E. Smith (the Lensman series and Masters of the Vortex[sometimes called the \\"History of Civilization\\"], the Skylark series, Spacehounds of IPC, and the Galaxy Primes). These are generally standard, 1930s and 40s style science fiction with (possibly simplistically drawn) good guys counter posed with some sort of evil empire. {I've read the 6-volume Lensman series perhaps 30 times starting at age 10 ad the 4-volume Skylark series perhaps 10 times starting at age 18, and parts of the others 5 or 6 times.}Subspace Explorers seems to try to extend the \\"History of Civilization\\" concept by adding the cold war, rapacious capitalists, corrupt unions, the generic battle between the totalitarian forces and the (top-down controlled) \\"democratic forces\\", a whole menagerie of mental powers (both between people and between people and physical objects), and lots of coupling between physically and mentally enhanced men and women to the mix. The babies produced by these couplings seem to disappear from the story until they reappear (with great powers) when necessary for culmination. The plots and subplots move like lightning, with little connection or transition between them.My impression is that E.E.

While such things are extremely important to a study of Japan, they do not compromise the entirety of a people's culture. Think about it. If you were to write a book on the American way of life, you would of course talk about Washington D.C. and our capitalistic mores. Yet this does not begin to describe the common life of an American citizen, with our hot-dogs and station wagons, baseball and fairs...all of which is just is important and perhaps even more interesting. Nor would it give any real practical information to a Japanese student seeking to come to America on the way we really live.So it is with most cultural guides of Japan...and this book proves to be a great exception. It is comprised of one hundred short essays, written by foreigners, about things that they perceive as essentially Japanese. For example, they have written about tatami, the traditional mats the Japanese use to cover their floors, and manga, the Japanese comic, as well as the proper business card etiquette and how a Japanese wedding is performed. These are all extremely interesting tidbits about a very different culture, and for a serious student who might be thinking of visiting Japan, or for one interested in the realities of Japanese culture, this book is just the thing. Perhaps the only problem is its date, being written in the early 70's. Yes, we cannot think that nothing has changed in Japan in these thirty years...yet despite the time gap, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Hundred Things Japanese","review":"This book provides an interesting look into several Japanese holidays as well as many longstanding traditions."},{"Title":"A Checkered Past","review":"The author has been incarcerated in Florida for most of his life, starting at age eleven.

Knowing Billy in his early years as I did, I recalled many of the situations he had gone through. His writing seemed to be very balanced and on spot for the years that I knew him. I lost contact with him after '71-'72 so I can't really comment on his later years. However, his candor throughout this publication made me a believer and his story was a real awakening for me. I was shocked as to the degree of corruptness in the Florida State Penal System and saddened by the terrible decisions that Billy continued to make in his later years. However, After having read his book, I truly felt that he owned up to his responsibilities for his actions, while at the same time, wishing he had gone in a different direction.This book is very well written, and at times quite disturbing, but you will not be able to put it down after you start reading it.

I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war.

Set in New England, the story captures the essence of sisterhood and finding things to occupy the time in days when there was little money or entertainment provided.Written by Louisa May Alcott, the story retells the childhood of Alcott and the ways that strong family values helped hold the family together during tough times. The story tells of how the family followed the transcendentalist theories which emphasized always perfecting oneself. The girls all struggle to find their place in the world and their own personal perfections throughout life.Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy all struggle with where the days of childhood end and the days of being a Woman begin. Each girl tries to discover her calling and her gifts that she will present to the world. Whether an artist, a writer, or whatever life calls them to be, each of them have dreams of growing up and making their mark on life and the world.The family seems to overcome all obstacles handed to them. Whether their father is away at war, money is hard to come by, or illness plagues the family, they always seem to get through it.

It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not. But I still think this was a great book and I reccomend it to anyone searching for a book that you can not help but care about the characters."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was nine years old i read little Women. Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book. It is about four sisters who live with their mother, \\"Marmee\\". Their father is working in the Civil War. I think it was very interesting because Miss Alcott makes it full of surprises. Even when sometimes the surprises seem out of place, everything comes out perfect.Anyway, it has a very nice ending, and I loved reading it even though it was very long."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I thought the book was rather good. It was kind of easy to read and easy to follow. I also liked it because it was about four sisters. I think books with sisters it in are good for children to read so they no what other ppl think its like to have sisters. Then ending was really cute too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had to read this book for a high school English project. I thought the book was very informative. Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots. I didn't wanna put the book down, event after event, it kept on coming. I encourage you to read this book whether your 14 years old or 60 years old. It teaches good moral values."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott should be read by middle schoolers because it shows great moral values. For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women is truley a literature classic. This book reflects on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War. While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war. The four girls must learn many lessons in life and grow up to be fine women even during hard times. The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls. At times this book could run on, so that is why i rated it 4 stars, not 5. However, this book still is great and a timeless classic and Louisa May Alcott did a fine job with the book. I enjoyed the book alot."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was a little girl, I didn't read very much, so I read this book the first time as a teenager. I don't think I would have liked it so much, if I hadn't. It was the first novel I'd read in a long time, and has been my favorite book ever since. The movies don't do it justice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a one beautiful book to read ,the beauty of the book is that it has so many central charecters and each one holds his and her grounds completely.Amy is a wonderful girl ,who keeps the string of happiness in the family,but its the Mrs. march who is the driving force in the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's novel recounting the lives of the March family is aremarkable book reflective of her own unusual upbringing (the Marchesare all modeled after her real-life family, from her artistic sister May to her scholarly father). The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston. What a wonderful way to come back to a book that shaped my life and ideas of independence."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"OK, so after the 17 hundredth time (yes, I'm exaggerating), I have finally finished Little Women, and I'm so glad that I did! It's so totally excellent, and each chapter has a moral. Like, not to be vain or to not waste time or to not put much stock in riches, for money never was the equivalent to true love and happiness. I cried &amp; sobbed, and laughed and just generally thought &quot;I wish I were as contented as Beth, or as clever as Jo, beautiful as Amy &amp; charismatic as Meg.&quot; You fall in love with each of these girls, and Miss Alcott gave such a perfect description. I LOVE this book! Read it, and you'll never regret it. Pefection, pure and simple. It isn't any wonder that this book has turned into such an American classic."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I thought this book was great. It is one of the most influential books I have every read. I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books because they have good morals and lessons in them. I also would like to say to the ealier reviewer who thougth this book was &quot;Extremely Fictional&quot; because of how perfect the family is, this book is based on a real family and the character Jo is based on Louisa herself. Families really can be that happy. I would highly reccomend this book and any of Louisa May Alcott's books"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book was rich in a kind of sensitive way. It was writenfrom the eyes of Jo, the tom boy. There are 4 sisters. Jo and Amy havea temper tantrum. Mr. March is away working. A rich neighbor has a grandson that all of them get to adore one way or the other. It is written in a classical way, which is rare these days. I hardly ever give books a 5, but this time is an exception. END"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm buying this book from amazon. I love little woman! I've read a old kids version twice and seen lots of versions of the movie and I always fall in luv with Laurie! lol Well not really. But it's really good!

But, I selected this book to read outloud to a woman in a nursing residence who cannot see good enough to read herself. Her hearing is also an issue. Therefore, I read loudly. The errors in spelling make the flow of reading aloud difficult. Otherwise, it gets the point across. My mom read this book to me when I was little, and therefore wanted to share it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have loved this book since I was a little girl. My favorite character will always be Jo March. As you read you can just visualize her strong will. I cried when she didn't marry Larie, but she truly loved the professor.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Its a good history, easy to read and enjoying each page.Good for the Autor and for Amazon that make possible read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Very well written.

I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I hadn't read Little Women since I was in middle school so it was nice reading it as adult. I was planning a trip to Concord, MA so I wanted to read it prior to touring the actual Alcott house.

Alcott's Little Woman as our book club's (On the Same Page Book Club) December/Christmas pick-of-the-month (we decided to choose a light, beloved book from our childhood). I first read this book when I was 8 years old (I'm now 68) and I fell in love with all the characters. I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a \\"capital\\" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!) On the other hand, the story is so heart-warming and charming, I soon was able to overlook the fact it was written more than 150 years ago. It is surely a CLASSIC and will remain so for generations to come!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"One of those books I never read as a kid and decided to read before I read 'March', written by the author of 'People of the Book'."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless classic that all should read as youth and adults.

Heartwarming=)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this was a really good book and it is one of my favorites. this was one of my first books i learnt to read. i have the soft cover and hard cover and now on my kindle. this book just tells us a little what life was like back then during the war. if you enjoyed this book i think you should read Pride and Prejudice if you have not read these books you should not be able to call yourself a female this book is also for men. i am still in school and when i asked one of my friends if she had read these books she asked, \\" aren't those soap operas?\\" My male teacher who was listening to the story was shocked to hear that she calls herself a girl. so read and recommend this book and much loved classic even if you are just protecting your gender. these aren't just sterling classics but titanium classics. this is a huge must read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Whole Story Books is a fantastic line of classic literature with various information in the margins that relates to the stories. In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting. But overall I think it is worth reading for its messages, plus it's free on the Kindle so I have no complaints."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Ms. Alcott presents a charming mixture of realistic children's behavior and idealistic moral lessons.

I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children. Perhaps the picture is deceiving customers and we are not talking about the same edition?GABRIELLE"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a special read for me as I grew up watching June Allyson play Jo March in the 2nd movie remake. It was interesting to read all the similarities between the book and all movie versions, but I also enjoyed the stories that were not included in any of the movies.

Thx &lt;3"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Love this classic book, it contains everything I like about reading.I also like that it is offered free, I love the classic, we need to treasure them"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott.

I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read.

I typically stick with murder/mystery books, but since this was a classic and was free, I decided to give it a try. I love it! The way Ms. Alcott developed these characters made me fall in love with them and think about them even when I wasn't actively reading the book. Once finished, I found myself wondering what happend next to the characters and how they lived the rest of their lives. Not something I usually think about after finishing a story. Beautiful book and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story is about 4 sisters living in the mid 1800, somewhere near Washington, Philly, or NY. It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book alot.

I loved the warmth of love, family, and friendship this book teaches us."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This review refers specifically to the Penguin Classics edition of LittleWomen, as pictured, with the introduction by Elaine Showalter. If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book. After years of avoiding this paragon of femenine literature, I finally gave in and read it, and I'm glad that I did. This book is great. The author's use of language, the way that she writes is a pure pleasure to read. She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching. But for one glaring miss on the emotions of one character, I think the book is flawless and stands as a wonderful exposition on character and human relationships. I rate the book 4 and 1/2 stars, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to all the men out there that shy away from &quot;women's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Because of the reviews, I almost didn't read this book because I thought it must really be best suited for young teens. I'm so glad I bought it anyway. I found the characters so endearing and the story so full of emotion that this became one of my favorite books. I'm not sure many guys I know would care for it, but I can't imagine a female of any age not loving it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Before I read this book, I thought that magic and spells and imaginary books were the best. Then my mom told me I should read this book because I was going to love it. And she was totally right. The good thing about this book is that it is real. I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book. The characters will become your imaginary friends and I'm sure that, after reading this book, you will see life in another way. In a few words: I love this book and I'm sure you will love it too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is like the best vanilla ice cream-simple, sweet, pure, and something that always seems good, no matter what else you read (or eat!). As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now. Then my sister bought this book, and I just found myself intrested in the first page of the book!!!!!Its about 4 sisters Meg, Jo, Beth,and Amy. It warms your heart when the sisters sit together near the fire and read the letter from their father, and when Jo cuts her hair. You laugh when Jo and Laurie meet their 1st time and talks funnily. You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy. But the sad part, I think is how Jo loves Beth and is ready to give her whole life for Beth. Mr. Bhaer and Jo gets married and .....read LITTLE MEN!!!!!!

I soon picked up the book after that and could not put it down. It was wonderful! This is a story of four sisters facing the hardships of a nation at war, finding love, losing family, and having to grow up. This is a must read for every young woman as well as adults who will be able to appreciate this story all over again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was a classic,but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was interesting, I'll give it that, but it didn't have the key things that a good piece of literature should have.It was set in New England and told the lives,sometimes dull lives, of the four March girls. Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less. Remember there are always two sides to a loved classic book; it may be loved by some but disliked by others."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I remember first reading &quot;LW&quot; when I was in 5th grade.

It really was a &quot;progressive&quot;book for it's time in that these girls had ambitions beyond just getting married, is about following your bliss,doingwhat makes you happy and living your life to the fullest. That's what makes it so timeless."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....This book (and the books after it) were great.

I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War. The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands. Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced. They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place. These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock.

A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores.

Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth show us all of the mountains a girl could encounter.Meg, the oldest is strong and beautiful. Beth, slowly washing away like a wave upon the sand. Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical \\"little women\\" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all. The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted. The friendships and relationships this book has to offer are so much fun to read about, especially anybody who has been a 12 year old girl.Louisa May Alcott uses a wonderful narrative voice to tell the story. She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins.

While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is about 4 sisters the oldest Meg, the tomboyish Jo,sweet Beth and little Amy. Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said &quot;told yah so&quot; and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading. They still haven't read it but thats their loss!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I chose to read Little Women for my 6th grade English book report because I had heard that it was a really great book as well as a great American novel. I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge. But if you want a way to pass a rainy day (or even a snowy one), this is one of the greatest books to curl up with."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If you've never read this book, you simply have to! Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day. And the conversation in my novel BLOW OUT THE MOON about Litle Women, Jo, and Amy is one of the things that happened in real life just as it does in the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story. Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older... This is a great book for teaching these things to children."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale of four sisters struggling their way through life during the Civil War. I have read this book more times than I can count, and I still love it. Once I pick it up I can't put it down, lost in this seemingly fantasy world, which was actually quite true more than 100 years ago.My favorite thing about Little Women has to be the characters. Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages. I also reccommend Little Men and Jo's Boys to follow it up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real?

I read it in a week and when I finished it I thought, I should have read this years ago!! I went to the library the same day I found out there were sequels. Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping. It's about life and growing up and everyone on the planet should read it!Now I hope I've made my point; I have to go to the library now to get Little Men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women has been an endearing classic since its publication, and it has touched the hearts of many people. However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us.

But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady.

I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Don't get me wrong. While I'm the type that shrieks and covers my eyes when watching something like \\"Spiderman II\\" at a kissing part (or at a violent part, for that matter...) I don't mind books about marriage. And so the first part, Little Women book I, was a perfect portrait of a family. A good book, despite the heavy prejudice I carried against it, as it was (gasp) A Required Reading Book.The Part II, Good Wives, was -- er....interesting. Let's go through it, marriage by marriage.Meg's marriage. Cute. Same age, good match, and even I, who have decided that my marriage to ANYONE (or dating, for that matter) would be a sign of the Apocolypse, could understand why some less fortunate souls devote their life to another, staying with that person forever (well, not in the twenty-first century they don't - unfortunately). Meg and John Brooke was good. Nice. Sweet. You get it. Now let's move on.Laurie (Theodore's his real name, for all you thinking that to name a male child Laurie is about the greatest measure of torture you can inflict upon a boy) and Amy. Still okay, though -- and I speak for my entire class here -- LAURIE AND JO SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED!!!!Jo and Mr. Bhaer. Gag. Vomit. WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THIS AUTHOR THINKING??!! Assuming Mr. Bhaer is NOT in his late forties, assuming he is simply forty. Jo is around -- what, nineteem? Twenty? HE -- IS -- OLD -- ENOUGH -- TO -- BE -- HER -- DAD. She hits the ripe ol' halfway mark (in a manner of speaking) at fifty, and where is he? Seventy. Ol' granddad over there.Yep. Loved the book, hated the last romance. That's all I have to say.Rating: Very Good"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've always owned a copy of Little Women ever since I first read it at aged 9 (which means I've gone through numerous copies over the past decades!)

So I won't suggest this one."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"After reading Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre, both written in the 1800s and which I loved, I thought I'd try another classic, Little Women. What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war. Genre: young adult fiction."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.The movie, however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i wold not buy this book if i were you.(dont buy this book)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was a bland romance book.I am twelve year old boy so dont get be wrong that i read love books.Theonly reason i had to read this book was because my mom made me read it for homeschooling.I would no recomend this book for boys.Girls may be wild about this book but i think the book was crappy.But i gave little men a very good read.You can read it if you type in little men.Go to second page and its the first book on the top.Please read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book is so into depth and it gets boring after 3 to 4 pages of each action in the story.

STAY AWAY!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book [stunk] beyond all belief! It was already bad enough that the March sister were extreamly good (too good)and how they complained about stupid stuff, like noses and how they were poor (which doesn't even make sense if you have a servant and a manor!)but she killed of Beth so early in the series and Jo didn't even marry Laurie!! But instead married her sister IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT!!! It makes me wonder what could possibly fill the pages of the other two books. So I DO NOT recommend this book to ANYONE! Instead, try Harry Potter :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott, Little Women (Signet, 1880)I figured attempting to struggle through this for five months (actually, five months and one week) was more than enough torture, and so I gave up about a quarter through the book (I ended on page 124 of 455). I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible. Thus, one more book fed to the dustbunnies in 2009.

It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading. Free on Kindle -- so Kindle readers, download and enjoy this enduring American classic. Not just for children or for girls; I'm a 61-year-old man!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was in the 7th grade, my mother gave me Little Women for Mother's Day from my dolls (yes, I still played with dolls in the 7th grade).

When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today.

If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price.

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own. Watching each girl grow up into mature women was like seeing your niece grow up, mature, and turn into a new person."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've been reading on this book for some time; truth be told, I actually started reading this book about forty-five years ago! I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good. Genuinely inspiring people in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book. I found a lot of life lessons in it.

It was such a great book. You feel for each of the girls and find a little of yourself in one or all of them. This is one of those books I could see myself reading again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing. The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book but after reading it I didn't realize it had two parts ( Good Wives is the second) and bought the second book.

The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"5 stars!!!!

Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War.

Good-bye."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased a copy of this book strictly based on the graphics of the cover. I was truly disappointed when I received the book of LITTLE WOMEN with an entirely different graphic for a cover, no way resembling the cover shown."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I agree with the reviewer below me 100%. This cover is disgusting. I was hoping to find a lovely copy of this book for my sister as a gift because she loved the copy I purchased for myself a while back. Mine is from Borders classics but unfortunately I don't think they are making the same copy anymore. It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics. I guess this was an attemt of modernizing a book which doesn't need to be modernized in order to be loved, that is what makes it a classic after all. What a shame."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A bit repetitious in the character morality lessons but that's just from my adult perspective.For Kindle Users:Recommendation - if want a fabulous fully illustration version, mobileread has it. Note, Amazon keeps editing out where elsewhere to get this.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics. My teacher recommended \\"Little Women\\" for me to read. So, I went off and bought it at the bookstore. In this edition you read an introductin first which I thought was a bit boring and long. It tells about the back round of the author and how this book was made. This story is broken up into two parts. The story starts out with four girls- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic. All in all, I thought this story was pretty good and I am not disappointed in it. I am very happy I read it. I know it is a classic and I do understand why."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had to read a novel for my high school English class. I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition. I love the Barnes and Noble classics series! The text is highly readable and easy on the eyes (while maintaining elegance), and the covers are well bound and lovely for a paperback. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined. At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I give this a one-star only for the introduction. The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition. Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This may sound ridiculous, but I was bound and determined to hate this novel. I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing. It is there that Jo meets Fridrich.This classic novel of home, family and love, inspired by the author's own life, will linger in your heart long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read.

And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big.

Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story line is quite excellent, I love the words the Louisa uses! Such variety! In this book are triumphs and failures, love and loss. Overall an astounding book - I would read it again in a heart beat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

The print is quite small, due to the book's small size, but the binding is nice for a four dollar book, and my younger sister (for whom I purchased the book) is enjoying her forays into the innocent fun-filled world of Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy.

Certainly one can read this book only and get a good story. However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included.

Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are.

(For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them.

Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach.

Large men can like them too, however, if they are careful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women's Dreaming GlassesI have always had extremely vivid dreams. While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amys' father has gone to war and they all have their own problems. Meg suffers from her own vanity, Jo suffers from her temper, Beth is in danger of dying and Amy suffers injustice at school.I don't reccomend this book to boys, but it might be good to some girls."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott was boring. I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a mature mind and enjoys reading classic style books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The rating is for THIS edition of the book, feminist ideologue Elaine Showalter's genital revisionism blots the text everywhere. Nor is the theme concerned with the &quot;tension between social responsibility &amp; individual and artistic freedom&quot; except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with &quot;group identities&quot; who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility &amp; intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to &quot;re-frame&quot; &quot;de-construct&quot; and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture. Showalter's a scumbag."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really dont know what the hype is over this book. Its considered a classic, yet, it is boring reading. I didn't find any of the characters of any interest and the pace is slow."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is too long and very boring. There is just so much extra details in this book!!!! Half of wich, do not even make any sense!!! The girls in the book worry about everything and constantly cry, Marmee is and unrealistic mother, and EVERYTHING IS DESCRIBED! If you have patience for tiny print and dry story, you may find this book somewhat interesting.Also, I would like to ask, what is a teen girl (Amy) doing getting married to a man AT LEAST 40 YEARS OLD??!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I found Little Women okay, but a bit boring at times. There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I remember opening up this book one day when I was in a particularly melancholy mood. After reading a few chapters of this book, however, I found my heart warmed to its very core.I cannot even count the amount of times I shed tears while reading this book. Mr. Laurence and Beth's relationship is beautiful. The unbreakable bond of the four sisters is heartwarming. Laurie's friendship with the girls is moving. The connection between the girls and their mother is tender.&lt;Little Women> is...A captivating little novel that makes one remember that there are things more dear on this earth than money, fame, and other worldly things.A story of four magnificent young girls who go through sorrow, joy, suffering, and happiness to grow to be great women, all wonderful in their own way.Louisa May Alcott's way with words makes one adore the American language, as Alcott uses her words to paint the best picture of the welcoming home of the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Very good book.

I decided to download the free kindle book and read it. It was a truly touching story, but I have found that it varies somewhat from what I remember from the movie. Of course that is always the case. Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today.

I guess I was thinking too often the movie I so loved (the 1994 version) since there was so much that had not been in the movie, making it more drawn out and boring at times.

It came quickly from Amazon. It is a 300ish page hardback with moderate sized text. It is quality material, pages and binding. It is well worth the price. I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls. It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

I'm now almost 70. The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again. And I'm so glad. First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story. I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read. They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women Louisa May Alcott, 2004, 520 pages. $9.95Sterling Publishing ISBN 978-1-4027-1458-0Have you ever had a brother or sister and you just can't be without them?

They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full.

That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story of four sisters with thier own point of views.

It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to.

It has humour and warmth writtn into it. A Great book. Really a must-read. If there was a 6 stars mark i would have given it to Little Women:)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is my favorite of Mrs. Alcott's. It's wonderfully done; extremely descriptive. It is realistic, with ups and downs. Each character has its own personality; nothing has ever been like it before, in all my almost 13 years. It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls. I also loved the fact that Jo was a writer, because that's what I am; I just LOVE to write stories, especially about horses. I recomend this book to any old fashioned girl like me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for children and adults.

I ALSO RECOMMEND BECAUSE IT DESCRIBES WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN THE WAR DAYS AND HOW HARD IT WAWS TO FIT IN IF YOU DID'T HAVE MONEY."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book is so wonderfull i have read it at least 20 times or more and have seen the play and own the movie. Some times I wish I was in that sort of family were every one is close to each other and theres lots of people to love. I only have one sister and two dogs but i hardly ever see them thats why i would like a family like that. My faviorite part of the book which i could never do, is when Joe cuts her hair and sells it for money. I love my hair so mutch so I dont think that I could ever do that mutch of a brave thing for my family. I thought it was really sad when beth died I have never had anybody in my family die so I dont know how that would feel. I't was really suprising to me how thet got over it so fast.

At first I thought that it would be a girlish book, and I did not accept the offer. I will now mention that I LOVE to read. Several years later, one of my very good friends that had the same taste as I handed it to me and said, &quot;Read it.&quot; I obeyed and it turned out to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This classic story about the March sisters and their joys, hardships, and growing up has proved to be a great lesson to me and my friends. My favorite character is Beth (although I am nothing like her) because she is exactly like the person tht everyone wants to be. She is so kind and thoughtful, but so humble about her generosity. If you have not read this book, I highly reccomend that you do!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I would have rated this book a 5, except the author played with me the whole time, when all I wanted was for her to get down to the point. Also this book has many main effents and that makes it hard to make a summary which I must do for class. If I had rated if a 5 I would of explained that as a natural phenomen for nothing this good has ever gotten into print."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have loved these books ever since my mother introduced me to them at a young age (I was probably six at the time.)

Partically is because it's classic, secondly and mostly, though, it's because the story and the character itself was soooooooo good. Everyone, read this!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Okay, so I know it published in 2 parts. This book all to books together. P.S. watch the movie after. (read it for 5th grade)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"They did a great job formatting this classic! It reads easily, there are no typos that I have found yet and of course the book itself is... well... a classic! The story is one of a kind. One of those stories you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A classic I always enjoy reading. Such an endearing story. Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical. However, I really enjoyed reading it and loved that I could read it no matter where I was.

I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books, but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.

I was a little surprised to see how small the actual copy was as the copy I had years ago was very thick and bulky.

I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written. It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight. The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"What a great novel this is!!! It brings back so many memories of my childhood, I really love it. It is very easy to read (English is not my first language), very entertaining. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some will say that LM Alcott is too openly preachy, but her unabashed devotion to all the tried and true virtues is refreshing. The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of my favorite stories, it's very honest and kind, loving and hopeful.

A book of it's time, very engaging and endearing the story follows four sisters throughout their moral upbringing to womanhood. Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times. I would definitiely recommend for a heart warming story. I read it in abou four long stints, so be prepared to put some time on one side!Denise12/12/23"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have long been a fan of Louisa May Alcott and highly recommend Little Women be read to younger children as well as for teens. The engaging girls in this story are examined for their faults as well as their virtues. While it is an old fashioned tale, the message is timeless regarding choices that are made by young people. Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Little Women.\\" It was one of the best books I have ever read.

If you're not too sure about this book, throw your doubt out the window and read it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I consider the book Little Women a five star book because it is a well educational story of 4 young ladies that grow up to be women. They learned how to be women by taking care of themselves when there mother left to go help there father since he got sick while fighting in World War 2. Beth got scarlet fever. She was very sick and they sent a telegram to the mother. The mother came home and Beth got better. A few days later the Mr. Lawerence boy brought home a sepcial surpirse...the father. He came home just in time before Beth got sick again. Soon after she died. Amy went off to Europe with her Aunt March and Mr.Lawerence and the boy Mr.Lawerence were there.

I like how all of the 4 sisters were close to eachother. Amy really got on my nerves because she was so snobby and ladylike, but all of the other characters were interesting. It is definitely one I'll read again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Most people either hate or love Salinger's novel because they either relate to it or they don't; Little Women was a novel in the same way. If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER. You'd strip away all the justice of Alcott's classic by watching the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is by far the most compelling book of the century.

If you haven't read this book, you really should because it redefines our modern day concepts of family life and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Many people think diferently from me about the point the author wanted to put across in her writing. I think that the author wanted us to see the struggle that everyday life can be for the rich and poor alike.I also thought that she potrayed the girls as wanting to be good, becuase she wanted us to realize that deep down inside of all of us there is a part that wants to do its best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a great book for anyone to read!

I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person. I recomend this book to any woman, young or old, for the chronicles of the March family are not just a story, but a lesson in the true meaning of life;love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was introduced to LITTLE WOMEN at the age of 12 or 13.

They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again?

Thanks for the beautiful gold trimmed pages. She will love it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, being one of the classics of American literature, is not surprising to be said one of the best books I have ever read. The story revolves around the home life of four close sisters and two strong, moral parents. As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read. The book is printed on quality paper and beautiful cover. There is also a bookmark incorporated into the binding to keep your place. We have used this with the Unabridged story on CD to help the younger children with their reading. They can listen and follow along. It is a quality story, a timeless classic, in a quality binding. It far surpassed what I had expected in terms of paper, binding, etc. I am so happy we got this book, and the price was more than reasonable for what we received!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This edition of LITTLE WOMEN is great! First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women is a heart-warming story. It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys.

They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself. I hope you don't have anywhere to be because once you start reading this book you can't put it down. I recomend this book for girls of any age, young or old I am sure you will enjoy.WARNING:THIS BOOK CAN MAKE YOU LATE!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was our reading selection for October 2002. We thought this timeless classic story of four sisters was wholesome and heartwarming.This coming of age story that was inspired by the author's real life family teaches family values and morals. Each of the girls have their own set of problems but through love and understand they learn the lessons of life.All of us agree that the character were well written and the story is one that will stay in your heart long after you have read the same page. A few of us have read the many times and we all highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is heart-warming and inspiring. It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone. I like how the book is hopeful and am inspired to try and correct my faults and go out in search for my own &quot;castles in the air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy.

I read this when I was too young to appreciate it and have read it over and over again all my life. The heart of America. Buy it. Keep it. Treasure it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. As someone who never had a sister, I closed this book wishing dearly that I had. Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read ! I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic.

It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee.

Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago. From hair, dances, boys, and growing up. Little Women is a timeless classic that all are sure to enjoy forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task.

What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings.

They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother.

The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters? Read Little Women and get into the story. I think the best rating for this book is four and a half stars. It needed a little more happiness towards the end. But still take the risk and read Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver. To my shock, the receiver told me the book was very nice indeed but it contained only the first half of the book. I did not see anywhere where we are told about this being only half of the book unless you include the Library Journal description."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless story of four young sisters growing up in Civil War-era New England is the sort you can re-read over and over, picking up new details every time...Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March may face serious troubles, such as poverty and concern over their father, off fighting in the war; but no matter what, their unique personalities still result in endless daily squabbles and laughs...especially when their rich but shy and isolated young neighbor Laurie gets involved.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys,\\" which continue the sisters' stories as they mature and begin their own families."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a classic we wanted our grand daughter to read.

I would recomend this book to absolutly anyone!!!!!!!! Keep reading :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love \\"Little Women\\" by L.M. Alcott. It's a great book. Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review...

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago.

They are the March family, and they consist of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, guided by their loving \\"Marmee\\" while their father is away in the war.We first meet the \\"little women\\" when the older two are in their teens and the younger two are approaching those adolescent years. We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free.

I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"THis book was delivered in the condition promised (Brand new and shrink-wrapped). Great price too!Thanks."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people. Yeah, that might have sounded pretty cheezy, but it's still nice to read some books like that."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I haven't read this book &amp; probably should.

The sisters are Meg, Jo, Beth, &amp; Amy as best as I could tell. Does the mom have a name? 2) Is Teddy the same person as Laurie cuz I'm really confused on that. 3) What are Meg's babies names?

The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book. Maybe because they don't stock it?"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Not sure what I can add that other previous reviewers haven't already added except to say I liked it too! Good book, read it if you are at all interested in it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As the father of a teenage daughter who was about to see the screen play based on this book, I am probably an atypical reader of \\"Little Women\\", but I enjoyed it none the less. \\"Little Women\\" tells the charming story of the March family as the girls grow over several years. Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time. Occasionally it is refreshing to read a book which is just plain enjoyable, without devious characters and subliminal agendas. This book is a delight, even for those who are not, and never were, Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Wow. I thought that Little Women was going to be another boring old classic or literature book, but I was wrong. The adventures of the four girls (or little women, whose last name I've forgotten, which is typical of me, haha, but I think that it started with an 'M') are sweet and sincere, to me, haha, and I found this book sad, interesting, funny, and plain good. It touched me. Read this book, I say, everyone! And I know that this isn't a very thorough review, but reviews are for opinions, and that's my opinion..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about more than just living to please and getting married, it's a guide for life if you read it right! It definitely holds an honored spot on my bookshelf and it never gets old no matter how many times I read it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"All of Alcott's books are not only fantastic from the outside, but from the inside as well.Ken Landgraf's drawings are well produced,done intricately with lots of detail. Everybody loves the well-known March girls.Messy Jo,beautiful Meg,sweet Beth and the artistic and ever perfect,Amy.Whether they're putting on a play or forming a secret society,they always do it with confidence and with smiles in their hearts.This lively book will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat the whole way through."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a absolutely great book!! I just couldn't put it down. I also think if you like Little Women you should read Jo's Boys. I liked that book because Jo was my favorite character. Take my advice and read both Little Women and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly every year since childhood. This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood. As I pass through each stage in my life, I find that I understand one of the girls a little more and see more and more of the universality of its theme. Someone once said that Little Women shows how when you are young, all possibilities seem to stand open before you but as you make choices in life one by one other doors close to you. I plan to pass this book on to my daughters."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"That was one of the best books I've ever read. Louisa May Alcott is my favorite author.You have to read the other books in the series. I LOVE LOUISA MAY ALCOTT'S BOOKS!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read it last summer. I like it. My favorite character is Jo, the tomboy. She dosen't like any thing about being a girl. They all miss their father. Jo miss's him. She think it's so dreadful to be poor."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book first some twenty years ago. It was our high-school text book. I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently. This book is very poetic. I like the way the four girls are each interested in different things; for example Meg is very motherly, Jo is a tomboy and loves to write and do plays, Beth is shy and thoughtful and Amy is good at art and is very concieted. Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money. They realize that without a lot of money they are really very lucky and also realize that there are others with money that don't have as much family love as they do. I think you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite pieces of classic literature. When I realized I didn't own a copy, I decided to invest in one. So I purchased this edition.I tried reading it, and the font didn't agree with me too much. Furthermore, the binding challenges ones ability to keep the book open in a manner proper for reading.After a few tries, I gave up and decided it was better to just let it sit and look pretty on my shelf.I should have gotten the softcover version."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was expecting the book in the picture but what I received was a solid blue covered version. Would not go through this seller again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott has done a wonderful job making this book.I first read the easier book of Little Women and I loved it!This year I read the harder book and I loved it even more!Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read Little Women in elementary school, and enjoyed it so much that I read many of Louisa May Alcott's other works. Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like the book Little Women because it tought me I dont need money to be happy. The characters Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo, were happy because they had each other. They always talked, spent time with each other, and believed in God.Its pretty cool that even if they were poor they enjoyed them selves.They went to parties and traveled.They did what ever any oyher girl could do.Each girl had a specal thing about them. Meg was the oldest. She had soft brown hair,and was pretty.Jo was a tomboy. The only thing nice about her was her hair."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 10 and on a vacation, and for my lil brain at that age it was great, but now it's just a little too simple that the children always try to do the right thing no matter what, always do as their mother tells them to, and always end up learning something wonderful. For the young reader, read it! If you're older and you want to read a children's story, read it! but if you want to read a book that seems realistic, don't"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really did no t find this book interesting. I like James bond more. I grade it 5 stars. This is a girl but one who is a tomboy. But that is my opinon. Most people love it but I did not"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it. Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband. I just can't get behind that."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a very good transaction. The product was shipped on time and was in good condition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"ITS A GOOD STORY I WISH JO WOULD HAVE BE MORE TOMBOYISH BUT I LIKED IT"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have loved this book ever since I was in grade school! I bought this copy because I wanted a nice, hardbound version and I liked the illustrations."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"An adorable book that may seem long at times.The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a recounting of their lives, until three of them get married and have babies of their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places. Iprefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book month ago. I love it. Lousia May used her childhood stories wrote this book. In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers. If you like to knew about Louisa May Alcott, you should read this book, Jo acted a lot like Louisa May herself. I like is book very much it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have been wanting to read LITTLE WOMEN since I was in BYE BYE BIRDIE in high school because of an allusion made to the book by Rosie Alvarez and Albert Peterson. However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN. It has all sorts of great messages about faith, love, and life. It's a great book and I now know why it is Albert Peterson's favorite novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Oh,my sweet Lord I love this book!How original and captivatingcan one book be?From a girl who L-U-V-S Harry Potter ,Redwall,Chronicles of Narnia,The lost years of Merlin,Artemis Fowl,His Dark Materials,and the like,this book was quite out of theordinary.But I found this book thoroughly ripping and a smashinggood read.What a marvelous book!Warm and tender with a lot of TLC(tender Loving Care)!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"You should read this book because it is really exciting. It is about 4 girls and their rich next door neighbour Lauire. The girls miss their Dad who is away at war. Although the family is poor they are happy. Beth (the second youngest) catches a disease and her sisters care for her. At the end, Christmas is very special because their father comes home from war. I think only girls should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a good book overall. There are enjoyable, funny, romantic and sad parts in the book, but sometimes it was too detailed and descriptive. I did like the closeness of the family shown throughout the book through good times and bad. I like how they all learn about life while they're growing up together. I would probably have to read it again to fully understand it and get all that it has to offer.I also like the richness of the characters. Jo, the tom-boy, Meg, the pretty, mature one, Beth, the sweet, shy one, and Amy the artistic, prim and proper one. They are fun characters to read about along with Laurie, Marmee, Aunt March, and others.I definatly think this is a good novel to read because it is a classic and it would be a good one to read to learn more about the time period.I just wish it wasn't so long."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book is the coming-of-age story of four sisters. In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead. It offers just as much and more... esp. with entertaining situations that as compared to the reviewed are so much more the delightful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Please note that I am rating this particular edition of the novel. The book itself is surprisingly wonderful and easily deserves five stars. This particular edition, however, is flawed.

It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner.

Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read. Read this one. Your eyes will thank you later."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Much to my delight I read this book after a semester of boring classes and this was the PERFECT distraction. Even as an adult (almost there anyway), I could identify with nearly all of the March sisters, moved to tears and laughter throughout the whole book. I recommend Little Women to everyone especially young girls - you will absolutely treasure this book. Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a wonderful little book -a definite GREAT BUY! My wonderful mother read this to me and my brothers and sisters and we thought it was SUPERB!!!! This is an excellent price too! Why wait any longer to buy this great book which should become a family classic in your family as it is in mine.?"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"While this book is often relegated to \\"girl's fiction\\", Little Women should be read by anyone interested in American literature and history. Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. These sisters are very differnt. Meg, who dreams of having a husband and a family. Jo, who is a tomboy and who dreams of being a published writer. Beth, who is nice and sweet and loves to play the piano. Amy, who is vain and a good artist. Everytime I read this book, I cry. If you have or do read this book you know why. A very touching story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a really great book! If you haven't read it yet, READ IT TODAY!!! It's a great book that reads all too quickly. It's very strongly emotioned,so just about the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who are ashamed to cry! Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!? Log off, shut down and read!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"MAY17,2001YES, I HAVE READ lITTLE WOMEN. I ENJOYED THE BOOK BECAUSE FOR ONE IT WAS DURING THE TIME OF THE CIVL WAR TIMES,AND BECAUSE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE READING ABOUT MY SISTERS."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a wonderful book that shows how 4 sisters love each other through happiness and sorrow and pain. It is one of the most wonderful books of it's times."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is great! I love it and would even say that it is my favorite book. It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it. I know I enjoyed the descriptive tale of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a very interesting, realistic story. The different situations that these four girls go through are both heartwarming, sad, and interesting. I recommend that every person should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was an amazing book that pretty much kept me reading the entire time. I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read. It is the complete and unabridged version and the reader can tell that there's a difference. The story centers around four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy who are growing up during the Civil War. Add one loving mother, Marmee, the boy next door, Laurie, his tutor, John Brooke, and Friedrich Baher, a German professor and you have the best book of all time!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women (the book) is a great novel, and deserves 5 stars, it's wholesome and innocent, and it's a genuine classic ... but if you want the best edition of the novel, I suggest the Barnes&Noble print of it, and that's why I gave this review only 3 stars. The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I started reading this to my children, I had to read ahead. Soon I had finished reading it to me, but not to them! My oldest has since read it. I liked this book so much better than Little Men and Jo's Boys. Girls coming of age really strike a chord with me. I wish I'd discovered these as a girl!I would highly recommend this classic for girls and women alike. The stories are engaging enough for boys as well, if they can get past the title. :) It definitely belongs on my list of my 10 favorite children's books of all time."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Girls of all ages should read this book and come back to read it again as women.

For my recent (14th) birthday, my 16 year old brother gave me Little Women. I read it, and it took me a while, but it was totally worth it. Occasionally, I would have to re-read sections. But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as \\"Marmee\\".The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a young girl myself like this book very much because it gives girls like myself something to read that is not inappropriate. I really like this book because it gives me a look into how girls lives were when this book was written. Little Women is about the March family and their trials while Mr. March is at war. There are four girls Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy who expirence growing up in a society where you are judged by how much money you have. Eventhough they may be down on their luck they still manage to keep on giving to others that's what I really like about Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was really good.

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great classic read. I enjoyed this book decades ago when I was in high school, but enjoyed it even more this time.

It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite novels as a child. I just recently read it again and it was still a wonderful and entertaining book. It is still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great read.

Delivered quickly and will no doubt order from them again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I enjoyed it a lot. All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be.

It is, afterall, written during a different period. Even after knowing the story and seeing all the movie versions, I still wanted to read the original...no movie will make you cry more than the Book. At the end you will not want to say goodby to these sisters. I can understand why young girls read it many times over."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If you haven't read this book, I totally recommend that you do.

The illustrations by Jessie Smith are outstanding. Also, the story is set in a period of our history which is so fascinating."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book reads like a children's novel and is an extremely pleasant reading experience. Really lovely!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of four sisters growing up in their mother's house in (I believe) New England. We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today. For a period book, the writing is very smooth and clear enough for our generation to understand. In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then. The neat thing about Little Women is how I connect more with different characters during different points in my life. Romantic Amy, Rebellious Jo, Homemaker Meg, I love them all. This is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War? Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves. Louisa May Alcott also wrote the book kind of like a sequal to Little Women called Little Men,if you would like to know what happens with Jo."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of these four girls and their experiences growing up is one that all readers can relate to. I have read the book multiple times, and each time I do I discover a new thing about these vivacious girls.

Through the years I have read ALL her other books but this one remains my favorite. If you read it you will understand why it is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old. The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Hi I;m Amanda.

Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up.

That was when I decided to read this book, and it has become one of my all-time favorites! I would recommend this book to everyone - men and women, young or old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved the book. I thought that Louisa May Alcott did anoutstanding job describing Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.

I cried at the partwhere Beth died of Scarlet Fever. But other than that sadpart the rest of the book was great"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic. She is the third person who marries, and she marrys \\"the Laurence boy\\". She complains to many people that her nose is flat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too.I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a book for all ages. I have read this book numerous times and highly recommend it. It was the first book I bought my 8 year old daughter to read. That was two years ago, and she has read it twice.

The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult. I downloaded it so I could reread as an adult. So glad to have a free version for my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Please make it shorter and not to have so many confusing plots in it. But it was still a little bit good."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott. This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

I just about die laughing every time I read about Jo's going calling with Amy and telling the ladies of society she practices horsemanship by putting a saddle in a tree and bouncing!

(Jo, knowing full well Mr. Brooke came by to court her sister Meg, responds, \\"It's very well, he's in the umbrella-stand, I'll get him, and tell it you're here.\\") Or when it dawns on Jo that Mr. Bhaer might be interested in her, she is retrieving an errant ball of yarn under the table.

Reading your book really was a bizarre experience. Have one of you editors read this edition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Nothing is better than free! Aside from a few typographical errors in the Kindle version, this book is an excellent e-book freebie. I had put off reading it since I was very young but had always wondered at the hype of this book. It may well be considered a literary classic, although I still don't consider it a must-read for every young girl."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is best read at a younger age. As an adult, I can see the important lessons in regard to friendship, family and finding your place in the world even when it goes against the norm. I appreciate the simple tone and wording that would make this book an easy read for a middle school child. And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again. I would recommend it to my daughters for it's message, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends as recreational reading."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"One of the novels that I have read this summer was \\" LITTLE WOMEN\\" by Louisa May Alcott. The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings.

Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzzz zzz z z z z z z z z zz"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have loved this story since I was a little girl.

The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit.

Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done. I like how the language and story are so old fashioned and find myself using such dialect after reading it!

I strongly recamend this addion for its beautiful illustrations that complament the classic story, you will treasure"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book.

My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose.

Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned.

This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this when I was a young girl and reread it again recently.

It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters. Jo March being the real main character. If you have enjoyed the movie. Then you will love the book as it does continue past where the movies left off. With a loving mother and a father off to war the girls find themselves working, living and laughing. ITs an amazing book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This classic novel is a must read for everyone. I found it to be well written and most entertaining. Isn't it wonderful that we live in an age where books can be stored on a computer. Amazon.com is better than a bricks and morter bookstore, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just finished reading this book and I liked it a lot. The first three quarters of Little Women were amazing, couldn't stop reading. The last quarter was slow. I had to skip a chapter or two to keep from dozing off, but the ending was very nice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic. Recorded Books always uses excellent narrators, and Barbara Caruso is no exception.Now if I could only get my hands on audio versions of Little Men and Jo's Boys, so I could once again enjoy those favorites, also...."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it.

However, it didn't really detract from the reading experience for me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've read this book several times and it just gets better and better. It's so much better than any movie ever made...although the Wynonna Rider version is my fav. It's a timeless tale that lures you in to a family's struggles, joys and strength. My daughter and I put this at the top of our favorite list in all time reads."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Although somewhat dated, it was a pleasure to read this story of 4 girls growing up in a simple time.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was in junior high, my mom made me read Little Women for one of my school assignments.

A MUST-read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"very timely delivery. got for granddaughter and know she will love it. every young girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My first actual introduction to Little Women came from watching the Winona Ryder version of the film on a snowy, beautiful day in New England during my sophmore year of high school. I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked this book sooo much! Sometimes the way the language was back then, i had a little bit of a hard time understanding it, but all in all what a wonderful story, and i fell in love with all the sisters in the novel! Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott has been undervalued for most of its history. This book is a true American Classic. Published originally in October of 1868, it is a story set during the Civil War, but Alcott does not deal with the specifics of the war. Instead, it serves as the pretext for the absence of Robin March, the father of the four \\"Little Women\\", for a large portion of the first book. The novel today actually consists of two books, the original \\"Little Women\\" from 1868, and the sequel \\"Good Wives\\" which was published the following year in April of 1869. The two volumes started being treated as one in 1880.The first book deals with the growing maturity of the four sisters, and in particularly of Jo and Meg as they have to learn to help their mother out more and do with less during the war, and while their father is away. Meg is the eldest at 16 when the story begins, and Jo (who clearly represents the author) is 15. There is then a gap of a couple years with Beth being just 13 and Amy 12. Their lives transition from that of young girls to young women, and each sister has her own unique traits. Margaret \\"Meg\\" with her beauty is following the traditional path in entering society and heading towards marriage. Josephine \\"Jo\\" is attracted by intellectual pursuits, in particular reading and writing. Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" is very shy and demure. She is also a peacemaker between the sisters, and enjoys helping others. Sadly, she also falls sick and never fully recovers from scarlet fever. Amy is the baby, and likes to tag along with others. She is also used to getting her own way.The first book is masterful in its simplicity. The story feels real, undoubtedly largely due to the author drawing on her own experiences, but Alcott also cleverly avoids adding too much into it and thereby making it unrealistic. She chooses a good steady pace, and the characters are well defined and consistently portrayed. Her dialogue is not perfect, but that adds to the overall realism of the telling of the story. It is a wonderful story for young women to read, and is also very readable for older readers.The second book is fairly good too, though it fails to be as believable as the first book as Alcott allowed herself to be convinced to have Jo marry. Alcott never married, and the union she chooses for Jo is a bit unusual and thus it doesn't feel right. Outside of that, though, the second book is a worthy successor to the first. Meg's choice of husband fits perfectly with the character and ideals that she develops in the first book. Most of Jo's actions in the second book also fit well with her character up, including her avoiding marriage with Laurie, her friend and neighbor who plays an important role throughout both books. Only at the point where Jo marries does it not fit. The tragedy of Meg's passing is beautifully described, and the reader is touched by the goodness of her character. Lastly, the full development of Amy fits well, including her choice of spouse.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Little Women\\" includes a very informative introduction by Elaine Showalter and extensive notes by Siobhan Kilfeather and Vinca Showalter. One of the important notes is that this edition is based on the original publications, and not those which were amended by Alcott for later editions, though obvious printer errors were corrected. There is discussion of some of the changes which Alcott made in the notes to the text. This is a wonderful book, but I will take part of a star away and round down for Jo's forced marriage."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book because of Jo March.

They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer. Little Women brings the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one. The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance. Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her.

Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world.

Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with? LITTLE WOMEN is primarily about that bond, and it's a great, malleable dramatic subject."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Have you ever had the life of poverty?Having your father away in the Civil War not knowing when he'll back?Or waking up on Christmas morning not having any presents?Well, you soon know how it feels in the great book Little Women.

Read the book to see how their lives run and see how they get married."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was a young boy, as well as the other three books of the series. It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments. If you like the first part, you will also like the other three novels, although this is the best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"little women was one of the best books ive read. the girls meg, jo, beth, and amy all have their own personallity which add to the humor and the saddness of the book. laurie( thier next door neighbor and jo's best friend) is a wonderful, giving guy who is trying to win the heart of one of the sisters but you will have to read the book to find out which one. overall i give it five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"&quot;Little Women&quot; was one of the best books I have ever read, and I am no stanger to the literary world, not to mention Victorian-era classics such as this. Never have I read a book that better deserved the title, &quot;classic.&quot;This is the moving story of the 4 March sisters, each strong in their own accounts and weak in others. It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole. Though the recent film treatment of the book is probably the definitive screen treatment, it could never capture the sense of beauty that the book did, or develop the characters as well.I was only 15 when I read this book, but I consider it to be one of my all-time favorites even still.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE, but anyone with an appetite to learn and an appreciation for life in general (or lack thereof) should find this book a reminder that despite wealth, poverty, sadness, happiness, death, and all other aspects of life that may separate us, we are all human, and the one thing that keeps us us together is love. -Ben, age 16"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it.

Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner.

I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am absolutely torn as to how to rate this book.On one part, I feel awful about giving it a BAD rating, because it is a classic novel with an impeccably clean story.On the other hand, I can't bring myself to give it a GOOD rating, because the whole thing read like a Puritanical rant.Therefore, I think I will go with a 2.5 out of 5 star rating.I feel that Ms. Alcott said it best in the following quote: \\"'You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the Ten Commandments?...This man says, \\"An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy\\"...The next, \\"The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fantasies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\"'\\"As this quote was found in Part 2 of the book, which was written some years after Part 1 was published, I can only assume that the quote itself reflects real criticism that Ms. Alcott received for Part 1 of Little Women and reiterate that \\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\\"Of course, all of this is coming from one who is long past childhood and young adulthood and therefore somewhat jaded in both spiritual and relationship matters, and as this book is basically the epitome of happy endings and moral tirades, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it as much as I may have 10-15 years ago."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together.

When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other.

Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago. I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars.

The constant use of source material referenced breaks up the expected monotony of when reading a text book and engages the reader much more effectively.Even after reading it I still find myself pulling it out and using it a bit like a dictionary when I hear things mentioned like the Magna Carta, Cromwell, or the War of the Roses.Whilst I'm sure there are other books out there on the subject that are more detailed, this book gives an excellent overview for the Britain enthusiast who wants a clear understanding of the region's chronological history."},{"Title":"Gay-Neck: The story of a pigeon","review":"Being a bird lover, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was a little far-fetched, which added to the romance. There was adventure, some excitement, and wonderful insights on bird and animal behavior given by way of the yarn.

He gives a wonderful perspective on the Great War and life as he knew it as a boy in India. A slant you don't get from history books or tourists.

I have been talking to my older son about using \\"10 cent words\\" in his writing as opposed to \\"1 cent\\" words. After reading this book he was inspired to use his words to paint a picture for his readers instead of just telling them what happened. He wanted his readers to experience what he was trying to convey as he had experienced what Dhan Gopal Mukerji had written. His writing has improved 150%.Not only does Dhan Gopal Murkerji not write down to young readers; he also does not shy away from tackling complex life issues in his books.

Because that name was an Indian name and my heritage came from India. But enough of that. Gay-Neck's story had been told so movingly that you'll never forget some of Gay-Neck's adventures.

This story is about a boy in a high caste (Indian social classes) and a beautiful pigeon. At first, it talks about Gay-Neck's birth and training less thrillingly, but when you get to Gay-Neck's first experience against a hawk, you'll want to know what happens next. Soon you experience the battle field tension as Gay-Neck goes to war as a carrier pigeon for the first time. You can almost actually feel Gay-Neck's experience when he was shot and then healed by the lamas (the lamas are Buddhist monks in India). Dhan Mukerji's describes this story in such a great way. Imagine the distress to find out Gay-Neck's dad had perished in a rain storm after all Gay-Neck and his dad has gone through: pain, frustration, stress, and joy. For a few days Gay-Neck and his mother only sat on the tall roof top looking up at the sky through rain, sand, and wind storms waiting and hoping for a miracle that wouldn't come.

Sometimes, you get a 'bad' on in the bunch. Gay-Neck, the Story of a Pigeon by Dhan Gopal Mukerji is one such book.While not a horrid book, Gay-Neck is also not a book I would recommend or reread. I picked it up because it is on the Newbery list, and it is one of only two books thus far that I truly disliked. (The other being Hitty: Her First Hundred Years by Rachel Field.) It's been a little while since I read this one, so my memory of specific details, but the way the book made me feel is still pretty fresh. I was reorganizing my books for storage (sad, I know) and I saw this one, and decided to write my review now and get it over with while I was thinking about it. ...The book is about a young boy in India who trains pigeons around the time of World War I. Gay-Neck happens to be one of his prized pigeons. Initially, our narrator is the young boy. Through him, we learn about the training procedures for carrier pigeons and what his life is like. Later in the story however, we get to hear from Gay-Neck himself as he goes off to war and a few other places as well. I have never been a big fan of animals being the ones to tell a story. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, I rather dislike that.There wasn't much that I liked about this book. The writing never grabbed me, the story never interested me, and the characters never moved me. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel when a pigeon starts making eyes at this pretty lady pigeon, but I definitely missed that one.I respect this as an award winner, because there are very few award winners that are so obviously set in, or about other cultures beyond America. Not to say that the book has no merit on its own, but I believe the glimpse into another culture played a large role in earning this book the golden sticker. I can't think of another Newbery book set in India or written by an Indian author right off hand, and it's always nice to be able to add a bit of culture.Although I wasn't a fan of this book, I can understand why some view it as a distinguished contribution to children's literature, and I've even been told that there are people out there who truly enjoyed this book. I haven't met any yet, but I'll let you know if I do! I think that this is a book with a very limited audience, and sadly, one of the Newbery winners that has not stood the test of time well."},{"Title":"Gay-Neck: The story of a pigeon","review":"I enjoyed reading this tale because it's not to often that I travel through Himalayan jungles or traipse across the Indian countryside. I'm sure anyone would like reading about sleeping high up in a tree and listening to all the wild animals in the jungle. Gay-Neck encounters many adventures that test his will. He overcomes his fear of flying time and again with the help of a dutiful owner and nearby Buddhist monks. The end of the book has a beautiful moral that all could benefit by reading."},{"Title":"Gay-Neck: The story of a pigeon","review":"This is a delightful narrative, written in the beautiful language of the early 20th century, which gives readers a glimpse into the incredible personalities of pigeons, and the heroic deeds they've done for centuries on the battlefields of the world.

A 2003 update of a book originally published in 1987, MUSTANG SURVIVORS is a sumptuous 174-page guide to P-51 airframes worldwide, flyable and otherwise. Brimming with photographs and fascinating facts on North American's legendary warbird, author Paul Coggan's book is a five-star tribute worthy of its subject.The meat of the book is a 100-page breakdown of Mustangs around the world, arranged by model designation (XP-51, A-36, P-51B, etc.). Coggan supplies the aircraft's serial number, owner, status (flyable, display, etc.) and a short history of the plane. Many of the aircraft are illustrated with one or more photographs, usually in color. There have to be 300+ photos in the book. Some of the shots, especially the air-to-air pix, are drop-dead gorgeous.In addition to that 'Mustang log,' there's also chapters on where all those airframes came from, the Mustang restoration business, P-51 powerplants, Mustang markings (with lots of nose art closeups), fascinating comments from Mustang owners and pilots, etc.If Mustangs are your main squeeze, you'll want this book.

If that makes sense to you you'll like the book. Marco is a younger Italian bachelor who lives with his mother. He is the driver for the tour. As the tour progresses a romance blossoms between the two. What future does a love affair between a Texan and an Italian have? Especially due to the serious age difference?The book has lively descriptions of places in Italy, particularly Florence, and some places in Texas. The two main characters are excellent. Anne is attractive and at times any reader would feel an emotional attachment to her. If you don't, check and see if your heart is still beating. Marco, at times, is good for Anne, but he has some strange ideas about life.This is not a formula romance novel, you know, where Tarzan meets super model. As you realize it's different you begin to wonder how it will end.I will read this book again, and I may have to buy several more copies. There are times when Marco does or says something to Anne and I want to crush the book under a rock."},{"Title":"An Invisible Woman","review":"The heroine of &quot;An Invisible Woman&quot; is Anne Whitman, a reserved older woman who travels to Italy on her first holiday alone. While there she meets Marco, an intense and sometimes depressed younger Italian. They begin a love affair that surprises them both with its passion and heat. Each of the two main characters lives the events in their story from his or her own perspective. Did I say that right? Just when you think you know about where they stand with one another, the other one relives the same scene and you get a completely different picture. The reason I gave the book (which held my attention throughout) four stars is that at a certain point I couldn't understand Anne's willingness to &quot;put up&quot; with this difficult man. Then I thought about the times I, a much younger woman, have done the same kind of thing. And that goes for most of my friends, too. This is not a formula romance. It's as unique as the two characters. I loved the Italian scenes especially because it's a place I have always wanted to visit. Maybe Anne isn't a 21st century woman, and Marco sure isn't a modern man. ( He probably would have been happier in the 19th'century). But these two are true to themselves and that makes the book honest as well."},{"Title":"An Invisible Woman","review":"Decent romance set in Italian Mediterranean. A little sappy at times, but holds one's interest. Marco, the Italian lover, is a new male individualist; romances with as many women as possible in life is the top priority.

Cooper's novel is the first of a trilogy about as many as six generations of the English-Dutch Littlepages. SATANTOE's hero is Cornelius (\\"Corny\\") Littlepage, born May 3, 1737. His still living grandfather Hugh (born in England, educated in New York) and father Evans had been career soldiers and later members of the colonial assembly. Evans had married into a prominent Dutch family.This novel tells of Cornelius Littlepage's courtship of Anne Mordaunt, also Anglo-Dutch, whom he met by chance in Manhattan during Pentecost street fairs by blacks in 1751 when he was 14 and she 11. This is a tale of how four repeated acts of protection or rescue steadily win fair maiden's heart. In 1751 Corny beat up a butcher boy who had knocked an apple out of Anneke's hand and made her cry. Two years after graduating from Princeton, during a second (1757) black slaves' outdoor fair in Manhattan, young Littlepage rescued young Mordaunt when a caged lion caught her scarf in its paws. During March of the following year (1758) he saved her from drowning when the ice broke up on the Hudson river near Albany. Finally, after the British defeat by the French at Fort Ticonderoga in July 1758, Corny and others saved from a Huron Indian raid a band of settlers assembled at her father's grant of land in wilderness 40 miles south of that battle site. Corny and Anneke were married in October 1758. Thirty years later Corny wrote down recollections of his life from birth to marriage. A principal goal was to preserve for posterity the facts of daily living in old New York.At least eight or ten unforgettable characters of SATANSTOE deserve singling out. Most of the novel's people are mixtures of strength and weakness, immaturity and insight, prejudice and courage. There are loyal slaves who think for themselves. There is a worldly Anglican priest and his successor as school teacher, the latter an opinionated prig from Connecticut. At least one memorable Indian, the Onandago Susquesus, is translator, guide, runner and mentor to whites in ways of the forest.Let me content myself with just a few words about one striking person: Duerck Ten Eyck, only 24 when he is mortally wounded in defense of the Mordaunts and their forest community after the disastrous British loss before Ticonderoga. He is pure Dutch, uneducated, wild, yet good-hearted and a great pet of ladies young and old. Dirck reminds at times of the brave but doomed Achilles. At others he seems the fun loving, roistering Prince Hal in Shakespeare's HENRY IV.Dirck Ten Eyck loves Anneke Mordaunt's closest girl friend, the beautiful 19 year old orphan of Albany, Mary Wallace. He proposes marriage to Mary dozens of times in the course of a few months. For her part, Mary tries to civilize Dirck, improve his raw manners and lift his mind. Duerck is putty in her hands. They are so different from one another that, though she loves him passionately, Mary never says so until he lies dying in her arms from his wound. Cooper seems to say that the English-Dutch social void is not easily bridged. Mary will spend the rest of her life regretting that she delayed telling Dirck of her love when timely knowledge of it might have made him risk his life less recklessly. By contrast, Corny Littlepage and Anneke Mordaunt are Anglo-Dutch, from two inter-connected families respected in both components of white New York.This is a great novel that deserves to be far better known. Read SATANSTOE to absorb the world of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANSThe Last of the Mohicans (Dover Thrift Editions), which plays out in the same time period.

These novels are a bit shorter and a bit \\"lighter\\" than the first series of five books (which starts with \\"The Chinese Maze Murders\\", or \\"Labyrinth in Lan-Fang\\"). Once again Judge Dee solves three unrelated mysteries, using his skills of observation and logical thinking, employing casual conversations with various protagonists as his main approach. In this episode, a nice twist is provided by the fact that Judge Dee is visiting a neighbouring district where his counterpart, Judge Teng, ask him for help: he has become both the victim and the main suspect of a crime! How this can be, and how the plot is developed towards an elegant surprise finish, reveals Van Gulik's skills as a writer. This novel makes great bedtime or vacation reading!"},{"Title":"The lacquer screen: A Chinese detective story","review":"The editors should have proofread one more time.

Building the molecules is very helpful in understanding the rules behind organic chemistry and helps the structures stick in your mind. The instructions that come with this modeling set are clear, and the variety of colors makes it easy to learn structure. I just wished there had been more pieces for &quot;oxygen&quot; and &quot;nitrogen&quot; so that I could have used the set for my biochem classes as well. But overall, a great learning tool for organic chemistry!"},{"Title":"HGS Molecular Structure Model Kit: Organic Chemistry : With Instruction Manual","review":"This organic chemistry set is very detailed and much more helpful than basic ball-and-stick sets. It is much more representative of the actual structure of a molecule.

The researcher's kit is unnecessary and doesn't have too many more atoms that are useful for undergrad organic chemistry. I recommend buying this particular kit (I did end up buying more oxygens and nitrogens)."},{"Title":"HGS Molecular Structure Model Kit: Organic Chemistry : With Instruction Manual","review":"I bought this product for school.

Also, they're pretty fun to make as well.Even if I never plan on taking organic chemistry ever again, I could still use the model kit to make awesome decorative pieces for my apartment.

Those years witnessed &quot;the short, unhappy reign of King Talal,&quot; his succession by the seventeen-year old Husayn, the near-drowning of Jordan in the swirling currents of Pan-Arab nationalism, and the eventual &quot;Hashemite restoration&quot; which has lasted to the present. By combing the archives, reading the published sources, and interviewing many participants (including King Husayn), Satloff has with outstanding skill pieced together the first reliable history of that turbulent period. As his title implies, the story is mostly about personalities; by bringing them to life, the author infuses his analysis with verve and interest. Satloff holds that by the time Abdullah died, his kingdom had been transformed from the simplicity of &quot;old Transjordan&quot; into a rather more complex polity, one in which the king relied on a small, select cadre of politicians and doers. Husayn first asserted his independence from those &quot;dinosaurs&quot; (most notably, by firing Glubb Pasha) and chose to steer the shoals of ideology (which at one point endowed him with a foreign minister whose overriding passion was to eliminate an independent Jordan as a step toward Arab unity). But, in the end, Husayn returned to his grandfather's ways, looking to the &quot;king's men&quot; to help him sustain a Hashemite monarchy in a most inhospitable environment.Middle East Quarterly, September 1994"},{"Title":"Frontier trails;: The autobiography of Frank M.

As a result his late work, in which his unique and beautiful touch and vision come into full flower, may be the best work he ever did. Some critics are dismayed or even offended by the late work, thinking it the result of manipulations by his dealer, assistants and Elaine, but the beauty and originality of these late canvases offer the best testimony against such views. This book is superb in it's organization, layout and printing, and the essays are convincing, eloquent and first-rate. Any lover of abstract art cannot dispense with owning this superb volume."},{"Title":"One Day for Peace","review":"In recent years, many YA novels have been written about the Vietnam War and the peace movement. While laudably intended to promote understanding and healing, all too many have failed to address the painful moral questions of the War. Whether this is due to a reluctance to assign \\"blame,\\" or a fear of upsetting too many parents, is difficult to say.Well, here is a fine book from the period in question that does not shy away from calling the War immoral, that does not hesitate to take authority to task, that does not fail to address the class and racial aspects of the War. Never strident, always gentle but firm in tone, it tells the story of a young white girl who is moved to organize a protest march when a young black man from her small town is killed in Vietnam. Written in sorrow for the deaths on both sides of the conflict, it's justifibly angry at the political delusions and empty patriotic slogans that kept the War going for so long. A short (barely 100 pages) but quietly powerful book that deserves reprinting."},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"The problem with this book is that it really seems like the author and editor didn't care about putting out a great product.There are lots of problems with this book. There are far too many typos (it's hard to edit a chess book, but come one!) and the organization is horrid. It's easy to miss crucial subvariations, and the lack of proper indexing, combined with poor organization, makes it very hard to find the game you need.Schiller's &quot;strategic overview&quot; in the beginning is a great idea, but it's executed poorly. A few examples concerning advancing the d-pawn here (rather than just scattered throughout the book) would work wonders.So why two stars? Well, because despite its numerous flaws, I find myself using this book a lot. There aren't any other good books on the Tarasch defense these days, and it's an excellent weapon for the club player. There is a lot of good information in here, it's just so hard tofind!"},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"This is a typical Cardoza book in that editing, proofreading, and careful production were not part of the equation. I can't understand why this publisher seems to take pride in sloppy work. That out of the way...Schiller admittedly loves to hype the things he loves, but that's fine. He is a big fan of the Tarrasch, but he backs this with solid knowledge and extensive practice, so it all works to the good. And that's the upside of Cardoza's line of books: they brim with enthusiasm, excitement, interesting ideas, and above all a philosophy of getting out there and winning. After a couple of hours with this book, you just can't wait to get out there and play and try out your new ideas. That's no small thing--- how many chess books make you want an afternoon nap instead?There are few full books to be found about the Tarrasch. Schiller's book fills a real hole. (The other book I know of is Aagaard and Lund's \\"Meeting 1. d4\\" which, while quite good, is more theoretical and dry.) Schiller definitely concentrates on ideas and typical plans and tactics for both sides. The writing style and presentation is cogent and easy to follow. You cannot get through this book without having a thorough conception of the flow of the Tarrasch. Enough material is presented on variants and alternatives to make the book a reasonable enough reference, though you might have to hunt around a bit; of course the book is not \\"theoretically complete\\" but it never seemed intended to be. As a good practical introduction, this book will have you playing the Tarrasch in tournament games rather quickly (as it is doing for me).Later on if you want to become a complete Tarrasch specialist you'll need a little more material, such as a game collection. But for getting going and learning the concepts, this book will take you quite far. You just have to grin and bear it when really obvious typos appear multiple times in one line.Overall 4 stars for content and sheer enthusiasm and energy; one star off for poor editing."},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"After reading this book I am pretty much at ease defending the Queen pawn opening. The strategy presented here will get you through the first 10 or so moves and keep you out of trouble. After that you are of course on your own but not without some ideas and places to look for white weakness. I liked the summary of the strategy that was given in the Overview and Strategic Goals chapters. The short study of alternatives in the last few chapters is also very helpful if the game does not open exactly as planned."},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"The problem with any book by Eric Schiller is that he seems to bite off far more than he can chew or he presents us with superficial stuff. He also seems to have zero qualms about rehashing editing hatchet jobs on books that have been previously written by other authors (see Schiller's book on Kasparov for an example). And here, as others have observed, he quite poorly executes what could have been a good idea -- a repertoire based on the Tarrasch Defense. It's all very frustrating for those of us who wish our chess books to be to be labors of love rather than hurried projects sent to the printing press before they are ready. The Tarrasch Defense deserves far better treatment than what Schiller offers us. I don't recommend this book to anyone. For a far better repertoire book based on the Tarrasch Defense, get Jacob Aagard's \\"Meeting 1d4\\", published in 2002."},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"A bit too much analysis with too few descriptions/explanations.

Pretty solid production"},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"This book covers the Tarrasch Defense which can be used against White's opening moves of c4,d4 and Nf3. The defense is quite sound and allows many various counterattacking and initiative advantages for Black. There is plenty of theory and analysis available for variation affecinadoes but some pawn structures available after exchanging pieces may leave some in disarray during middle and endgame play. Overall the author covers interesting lines of play and leaves the imagination and creativity to the reader. Remember, more chess play equals more experience and victory."},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"Schiller is a Tarrasch fanatic, and it shows in this thick (288 pages) well-produced epic on the Tarrasch Defence. It brims with enthusiasm and with tactics, strategies, traps, theory, history--everything you need to play and love the Tarrasch. The overview and typical strategies sections at the beginning are beautiful. Schiller does not sugarcoat this Defence, but he does promise you exciting chess and that by studying this opening your overall game will improve. It is important to learn how to play with an isolated d-pawn. Another great benefit of the Tarrasch is you can play the pawn structure against nearly any opening (even against 1. e4 you can play a French and have the same structure. Even though Kasparov gave up the Tarrasch, obviously it is a worthy opening if several world champions have played it. Solve the problem of the Bc8 being trapped in the most forthright way! Play the Tarrasch, and get this book!"},{"Title":"Complete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series)","review":"When you first see this book you figure, well the content has to be better than the cover. As amazing as it might sound, the content is even worse. The amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out. Trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful. How awful books like this get published is beyond my knowledge. Perhaps someone lost a bet or Schiller owns their soul. Maybe if your a 900 player this would help you break 1000. If your getting this book thinking your gonna be able to defend d4. I guess your gonna have to find out the hard way how shoddy this book is. A bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing. I think Ken Smith and Schiller should start their own club. Donate your money to a good charity or buy yourself something worth having.

Pick it up in conjunction with his memoirs (often available on remainder tables) &amp; you have a really good set!"},{"Title":"100 Years of Harley Davidson","review":"Harley-Davidson motorcycles hardly seem, at first thought, the appropriate topic for a glossy coffee-table type book. Having carefully cultivated a rebel image, Harley has for decades revelled in such perceptions, while customarily watching monied professionals drive off the lot on a Softtail. It's the ultimate in \\"irony advertising\\".But the Harley story is also an American story, one of tales from the road across the USA. The company, celebrating its 100th year, is one of the few motoring ventures that maintains an image of quality vastly superior to Japanese knockoffs, primarily because of its storied history and presentation in culture for the last 100 years.The story of the Harley Davidson corporate mentality, its financial devastation and recovery, and its appeal to an American society that loves its image takes up a good deal of space in this book, and makes for fascinating reading. In fact, the story alone would be worth a somewhat reduced price of admission (this book is expensive, after all), but the photography makes this a big keeper.Double page after double page of legendary Harley models, dating back to the 1900's, capture the imagination, and the beauty of design in an incredible light. Photos from across the country call out for road trips. The photos capture much more than the HOG they portray - they are an invitation to hop on for a ride through American history.This book is an excellent Christmas gift for anyone who owns, or always wanted to own their own Harley."},{"Title":"100 Years of Harley Davidson","review":"you'll find a good read. First, the pictures are sensational. They capture the simplicity which is at the heart of H-D's designs since inception. Also, this book explains many of the bike and engine nicknames, that I was always curious about, in an easily understandable way i.e. Shovelhead, Flathead etc....It also covers most of basic history of the MoCo but does so in a corporate promotional way. The author glosses over the AMF years when the quality of their products were poor. It's a 1 or 2 sentence mention and I think deserved more specifics. This is the only major soft spot in the book in that, at times, it seems like one of their rah rah brochures. Look past that and you'll find a great coffee table book.One question the book left me with is how much the author is genuinely involved in the design of bikes. He may just wish to support the other people involved (humbly). Otherwise, to read the book it seems his major talent is drawing logos (as it reads).

Probably in chrome. I originally bought the book hoping to do some resarch on historic color schemes for a new bike, and in that quest I found the book to be quite valuable. Beyond that I found it to be curious that the book was a square format and all of Harley's bike are a horizontal format, so that every beauty shot of the bikes is printed across a gutter. You never get to see a bike in full. It's maddening. That being said, the history of the company and the culture is wonderful and inspiring.

Jizo may set the world standard for the Buddhist vision of a compassionate life where the seeker forgoes continuously personal salvation and Nirvana in order to serve those more needy souls.Most Buddhists are aware of and have a close relationship to Kwan Yin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion and, currently embodied by the Dalai Lama. Kwan Yin embodies the subtle touch of a thousand hands. These healing hands customize and specialize in offering compassion for the world. Kwan Yin is often pictured holding a medicine bottle and standing or sitting on top of a dragon and fire and riding the safety of a turtle in the seas of birth and death.Jizo, the guardian deity of children, travelers and others is also the guardian of the Earth Storehouse and Hell Realm. Jizo appears in Japan as a childlike figure with a red bib symbolizing the offering to the sprit of aborted fetuses. Jizo also appears emerging from the Earth -- symbolic of our origination and our profound duty to serve our home world.One of Jizo's spiritual missions is embodied in her simple vow -- \\"until hell is empty!!\\" This dedication is to the needs of departed child spirits, the earth itself and the most desperate souls - those in a living HellThis mission of Jizo is profoundly transformative to the Buddhist seeker -- fearless we step forward to do our best to heal the worlds knowing that this is a never-ending journey and that Jizos' path is enlightenment itself. The Way of Jizo contrasts sharply with the many religions concerned with finding the fastest freeway to Heaven..The Way of Jizo offers us a bold alternative view of life and full time employment. If you are ready Jizo is waiting for you in this deepest, and profoundly hopeful of books"},{"Title":"Jizo Bodhisattva: Guardian of Children, Travelers and Other Voyagers","review":"Having read \\"Liquid Life\\" by William R. LaFleur I was ready for a deeper study of Jizo bodhisattva.When I first picked up Bays' book on this embodiment of compassion I expected a feel-good read. Not entirely so! The author is a paediatrician who deals with sometimes-horrific child abuse (I am grateful she said no more on this) and her husband, also a Zen priest, works with prisoners. These courageous beings themselves represent the fearless compassion that is Jizo; willing to face the most distressing aspects of human misery.Jizo bodhisattva is beloved to the Japanese, for whom he has taken on special duties to do with children and babies who have died, and miscarried and aborted foetuses. This is a peculiarly Japanese extension of his particular concern with those suffering in the hell realms. It is in this latter role that he is best known in China as Dizang Wang, a bodhisattva who first came to light as Kshitigarbha in ancient Indian Buddhism.All of these aspects of Jizo/Kshitigarbha's history and character are presented with a heart-felt quality such that I was both informed and moved by this book. It took me on a most unexpected journey.I found myself surprisingly engaged by the figure of Kshitigarbha. I came to realise that Kshitigarbha had already been there in my practice as one of the Buddha's \\"Eight Close Sons,\\" the main bodhisattvas in the Mahayana Sutras, in recognition of which I now practice a few additional minutes of recitation daily.There is an inwardness that communicates itself through the images and stories that Bays presents. In Buddhist practice we seek to become that which we, cough, worship. Daily I see the disturbing reality of aging, sickness and death in my work as a nurse. Bays' book encourages me to explore the possibility of, like Jizo, engaging courageously with the distressing face of suffering.Thankyou, Roshi-san."},{"Title":"Jizo Bodhisattva: Guardian of Children, Travelers and Other Voyagers","review":"Jan Chozen Bays studied under Taizan Maezumi Roshi, one of my favorite Zen masters. She is head dharma teacher at Jizo Mountain Great Vow Zen Monastery in Oregon. Also a doctor, she devotes her \\"free time\\" towards preventing and uncovering early signs of child abuse.

It's a powerful piece and especially great for women to use as cuttings for auditions."},{"Title":"The Childrens Hour","review":"The Children's Hour single handedly made me a Lillian Hellman fan. The story is of two women who run a boarding school for girls in the 1930s. When a rumor is spread that the headmistresses are having a lesbian affair, the school changes from being their dream to their nightmare. While the rumor is a lie, Hellman explores the impact of a lie and the ripples that it causes. No one is left unscathed in this beautifully written play. Friendships and relationships are tested when both women go to court to defend their honor. However, Hellman saves the worst for last.This play is nothing short of brilliance. The dialog is realistic, insightful, and telling. The characters are beautifully developed and intriguing. As the rumor spreads and their suffering begins, Hellman makes the reader feel that suffering with them. Hellman does not shy away from the tough questions of how far can a lie really go? where are our true alliances? what trials can be overcome? and at what point does one succumb? These are difficult questions to ask of a modern reader let alone one from the 1930s. Hellman had great foresight in writing this play for it is still relevant over 70 years later. This is a must read for all!!"},{"Title":"The Childrens Hour","review":"This vendor was very prompt with the delivery of my order. Also, the condition of the playbill was excellent.

Yet the 1961 release of \\"The Children's Hour\\" brought subject matter previously considered verboten to the forefront. Starring Audrey Hepburn, Shirley Maclaine and James Garner, this ground-breaking film, based on the screenplay by Lillian Hellman, confronts the rumors and accusations of lesbianism between schoolmarms Karen Wright (Hepburn), and Martha Dobie (Maclaine), the effects it has on their school, their relationships, and their lives.A whispered lie by a troublemaking and spoiled student leads to the turmoil that weaves its way throughout the community. Accusations and denials, students pulled from the school, gawking passersby, and an eventual lawsuit-machinations based on a child's lone statement-play into the storyline. Wright's fianc&eacute;e, Dr. Joe (Garner), stands ever faithful at her side, and Dobie's as well, ridiculing the accusations, eventually losing his job due to his association with the two scorned women. It is only at Wright's insistence that things could never be the same between them, does Dr. Joe finally leave.The intense interaction between all key players, especially Wright and Dobie, is what makes this movie so outstanding. When confronted with the rumors, neither woman expresses disgust at the thought, simply disappointment with the accuser. Wright and Dobie stand above the fray, becoming support for one another as their lives crumble around them.Although a little overdramatic, \\"The Children's Hour\\" is definitely a movie ahead of its time. A dramatic entreaty at the movie's close, brilliantly done by Maclaine, reflects thoughts and feelings many lesbians have felt at one time or another, and the unexpected, heartbreaking ending will have you in tears.

The play is very difficult to act, demanding of the two female leads absolute concentration, wide emotional range, and utter professionalism. It is also difficult to direct, as the script is very centered on dialogue with most of the central events occuring in the Greek style, outside of the scene. However, a skilled and dedicated cast and director can certainly create a beautiful and terrible prodution capable of seizing everyone in the house with the sheer force of its words. It is certainly just as fresh now, and perhaps even more so, than it was when it was written, sixty years ago. If you're looking to be challenged by a play, you could do little better than The Children's Hour."},{"Title":"The Childrens Hour","review":"Lillian Hellman's magnificent, heart-wrenching, ground breaking and beautiful 1934 play takes the aforementioned commandment and creates a stunning cautionary tale that is not for the weak of heart. The perniciousness of lying and the often tragic consequences therein form the spine of this, Hellman's first major success on the Broadway stage.Concerning a scandal at a private girl's school, Hellman bravely dramatizes the scars and cycles of abuse which result not only from lying but also from ignorance and cowardice. As I prepare this script for production in the fall of 2004, I find its themes timeless and as hard hitting as any contemporary work.In Mary Tilford, Hellman has created one of the American Theatre's great villians. She serves as the literary model for \\"Rhoda\\" in THE BAD SEED as well as \\"Abigail\\" in THE CRUCIBLE. She is the embodiment of souless evil, intent on destroying all around her in order to advance her own status. She is the type of character that can truly, to quote RICHARD III, \\"Smile and murder whilst I smile\\". As my cast staged a rough read through, the hisses and rage she inspires is frightening.Poetic without being obscure or pretentious, the dialouge is crisp and direct. Hellman's characters are three-dimensional and her pacing and story-telling is impeccable. I hope our production will do this great play justice.As for any potential readers of this play: don't hestitate. Add this to you theatre library immediately."},{"Title":"The Childrens Hour","review":"I recently saw a production of this at a local high school. It is one of the most dramatic, engaging, and infuriating plays I have ever seen. If you cant stand to watch supreme injustice, this play is not for you. The accuser of Wright and Dobie has to be the one of the most despichable characters ever devised. all of the characters, from Wright and Dobie down to the Delivery Boy, are engaging and realistic. this is a play that shows perfectly the serious harm that can be caused by \\"little white lies\\", and how prejudice effects everyone, even if they arent a member of the victim group.

I highly recommend this play to any production company which is seeking to put on a play with timeless themes that will captivate the audience. From the second you meet the characters, you identify with them, either personally or because you have meet people like these characters in your own life. The play echoes the real-life scenario of how things spiral out of control, and how sometimes we are too late to fix the damage that has been done.

At last a believable version of the age old classic. The book contains a twist like none other at the end. A must read for any fan of Lugosi."},{"Title":"Night of Dracula","review":"Despite the garish cover, I was prepared to like this book. After all, Bela Lugosi IS Dracula and his son's forward was the real hook. Unfortunately, the forward was the best thing about this attempt at modernizing Dracula.The \\"story\\" was vague and disjointed. It is supposed to be set in the year 2000 and some of the charactors in Stoker's Dracula appeared, but in different combinations. For instance, Mina is married to Dr. Stewart, not Jonathon Harker. The tale becomes very confusing. Apparently Dracula is now a poet who is broken-hearted about losing his wife, Alyssa. Who?? Well, there just happens to be a girl who not only looks like Alyssa but is married to an army surgeon who is conveniently overseas. There are lots of added distractions such as a mention of AIDS, antibodies, Bosnia, a pointless attack at a bus stop, etc. Nothing went anywhere or was important to the minimal plot. Most of the book is full of this drivel -- pointless descriptions, poetry (bad poetry at that) and bits and quotes from the Stoker book.The detective in the case, who was at best a minor charactor, becomes the hero who is apparently conflicted as to his beliefs in justice. In one instance he is passionate about bringing Stewart to justice after his murder of a prostitute was discovered. On the other hand he is passionate about forgiving Dracula for killing drug dealers...? He's stupid, as well -- how many times has he been told that bullets don't affect vampires? The author doesn't seem to know what side of the arguement he wants his charactor to be on. Dracula, too, comes off as a panty-waist one minute and a fiend the next. I suppose the author was trying to show the duality of Dracula's nature but he missed it completely.All-in-all it was a waste of money."},{"Title":"Night of Dracula","review":"I cannot believe that someone came up with a new and exciting story for Dracula. The plot was spellbinding. I could not put it down. And the ending...well, I don't want to ruin the ending for others. I will say that I was taken completely by surprise. Christopher Schildt is a wonderful storyteller. He is a master of his craft. I am looking forward to his next novel. Bravo Christopher! Keep writing!"},{"Title":"Night of Dracula","review":"Although I was slightly disappointed that the real vampire Count Dracula was not in this, I was quickly surprised at this rather genious reworking of the legend. This book depicts &quot;real&quot; vampirism, without the supernatural aspect, displaying it as more of a disease than a hellish curse. The plot is like a modern telling of the original Lugosi film, with some original additions and twists created by the author. The characters' names are the same, and at some points in the story it feels like we are not in modern day Georgia, but London in the 1800's. In any case, this was a very enjoyable book, and is by no means cliche or predictable. The ending, in particular was a very creative twist. What I loved most was how different this book would be than what I originally expected. If you love the classic monsters, or are a Dracula fan, read this book. It'll be a fun experience!"},{"Title":"Night of Dracula","review":"Christopher Schildt manages to capture in this unassuming mass-market paperback the essence and gothic elegance of Bram Stoker's original &quot;Dracula.&quot; Schildt delivers this captivating and fast-paced story with a literary flair that will leave the reader hanging on every word. Fans of the horror genre and of the original Dracula story will love this book. Other readers will quickly find that &quot;Night of Dracula&quot; is as much of a love story and mystery as it is a &quot;horror&quot; book, and will thoroughly enjoy it as well.I can't wait to read Schildt's next book!"},{"Title":"Night of Dracula","review":"I have just finished reading this book. It wasn't a copy of Stoker's work, nor was it a repeat of Universal Studios work. It was unique. In ever Dracula story Van Helsing cases after the vampire, with the help of Dr. Steward. I was really surprised when this plot took a different direction. It is filled with all sorts of great twists that are missing in other monster books like the ones released by David Jacaobs. What really took me by surprise was the ending. Wow I didn't see that one coming, much to my pleasant surprise. With that said, I would highly recommend this book. But remember, this isn't a repeat of Bram Stoker and I'm glad it wasn't. I know what happens in that story. I know how that plot goes. If you think you know what is going to happen in this book as a Dracula story you are in for a huge surprise and a pleasant one at that. This book is HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Night of Dracula","review":"I just finished reading this book and, while I have never written a review before, I feel that some of the comments made by another reviewer need clarifying, as this is far from an awful book. Christopher Schildt has done the unimaginable and written a contemporary Dracula book that is not cliche or boring. Bram Stoker's original characters are joined by Schildt's own, and all are exciting. The dynamism of these characters accurately portrays the conflict of the human condition, and the difficult choice between reason and emotion that we all face.Understand: this book is not simply a rehashing of Stoker's story, but rather an original story. And any educated reader will find that the mention of such topics as AIDS is by no means an added distraction or meaningless drivel, but an intelligent, albeit subtle, commentary on such a grave problem. Schildt's social conscience must be admired.Bottom-line: &quot;Night of Dracula&quot; is a well-written, enjoyable story, and well worth buying."},{"Title":"Monumental Miniatures: Souvenir Buildings from the Collection of Ace Architects","review":"Super 208 page volume jam packed with over 1,000 beautiful bronzetone sharp photos.

I do like how Holt only gives you a peek at Asian culture, just enough to make the story exciting (to be all honest, I don't read to many romance novels for their historic value).

Later novels like Menfreya in the Morning and King of the Castle are dull and formulaic. I really like the Gothic, Romantic Suspense genre, but Victoria Holt's later novels begin to lack the mystery and suspense that I love. The House of a Thousand Lanterns, while being very well-written and slightly informative on the English and Chinese cultures, is meandering and slow until about the last 100 pages (382 page book). Then I couldn't put it down. After having read her historical \\"The Queen's Confession\\", I believe Holt's true calling is her historical novels under her Jean Plaidy pseudonym.

A peacock, badgers, and diamonds are indeed featured in this British manor house mystery, along with Sir John Appleby, now retired from his high position at New Scotland Yard.As this elegant story begins, an antediluvian Chief Constable, Colonel Pride (late of His British Majesty's Indian Army) is driving Sir John over to meet his neighbors at Elvedon Court. Sir John was New Scotland Yard's acknowledged authority on art-robberies, and the manor's owner has suffered a recent theft:&quot;'Grove nods at grove' -- Sir John Appleby quoted -- 'each alley has a brother--'&quot;What's that, my dear fellow?&quot; Colonel Pride, who had drawn up his car on the Palladian bridge for a preliminary view of Elvedon Court, glanced at his companion with every appearance of perplexity.&quot;'And half the platform just reflects the other.'&quot;Ah, a bit of poetry.&quot; Pride nodded. He was seemingly gratified at having got, as he would have expressed it, right on the ball. &quot;And I see what the chap means. All a bit formal, I agree. What another of those long-haired characters calls fearful symmetry.&quot;The layout of Elvedon Court plays an important role in the ensuing mystery, so it behooves you to pay attention when the author is discussing its architecture.No sooner do Colonel Pride and Sir John pull up next to the stately flight of steps leading to the manor's entrance, than they spot a police van.Someone has murdered their host, Maurice Tytherton.Almost everyone at Elvedon Court is a suspect, including a shifty butler and his wife, a known art thief, the late owner's mistress and her husband, a sniveling nephew with financial problems, and a prying guest who may remind you of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. Sir John insinuates himself amongst the guests and relatives of the deceased and has a splendid time smashing alibis and detecting motives. There are lots of red herrings to chase after--for instance a vicar who lurks about the distinguished grounds with a pair of binoculars--but when Sir John finally rounds up all of the suspects into the deceased's study for the grand denouement, you may be sure he will finger the actual murderer. After all, &quot;Appleby's Other Story&quot; is from the Golden Age of British Mystery--the genre's Age of Enlightenment, as practiced by authors such as Dorothy Sayers, Edmund Crispin, Margaret Allingham, and of course, J.I.M. Stewart a.k.a Michael Innes.Incidentally, this book's title is a horrible bit of word-play on the solution of the mystery. I stumbled across its true meaning (shame on you, Professor Stewart!) while writing this review."},{"Title":"Tricks of the Internet Gurus","review":"Only good for people with big back sides!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Fox: A Novel of the 100th/442nd RCT","review":"Bob Kono's military/fiction \\"The Last Fox\\" was very good. It covered the action of the 100th/442nd RCT very well. I found the description of the battlefield very realistic and heart rending. When people ask about the travails of the 442nd RCT, they can now refer to \\"The Last Fox.\\"For every ten men in uniform only one faces the enemy and is in a position of being shot face to face or actually killing someone. The other nine men are important rear echelon, engineers, artillery, service supply, and training echelons but they rarely directly face the enemy. It is the rifleman in the rifle company who dig the enemy out of their machine gun nests on a person to person basis. The military campaign is well described from Anzio, Cassino, Rome to Pisa (Hill 140), France (Bruyeres, Biffontaine) and the breach of the Gothic line on the Apennines (Mt. Folgorito). Rarely does a rifleman or a medic like myself attached to a rifle platoon get the overall picture. The author has given it in all its glory and goriness. His comments and thoughts evinced from mail from internment camps and the main character, Fred's philosophy and counterpoint arguments with Sam, were well done. The bar room brawl was edgy but that is the way it was and the reconciliation in the hospital was very good.I liked the way the author covered Hill 140, our first 442nd RCT major battle in the early stages of the march above Rome to Pisa and to the RR embankment in Biffontaine, France. I can still remember that night in Biffontaine. It was very dark and I thought I felt a German soldier poke me and say \\"Hans\\" and then he melted back into the blacknes of the night before the attack.It must be noted that for a rifle platoon soldier particularly in a 442nd RCT rifle company that after a year in combat, you were either dead or wounded."},{"Title":"The Last Fox: A Novel of the 100th/442nd RCT","review":"***** A dramatic novel of many dimensionsReviewer: William Ratliff from Stanford University, Stanford, CA USAThe first and most obvious achievement of this outstanding book is its novelistic dramatization of battles fought by the all-Nisei 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team in World War II. Many young Japanese-Americans volunteered for the U.S. military after they and their family members (75% American citizens, mostly second-generation Nisei) were suddenly dragged off to concentration camps in the wake of Pearl Harbor. These young men became the most awesome, feared (by Germans), sought-after (by American military commanders) and decorated group of American soldiers fighting in Europe. Kono gives grueling, gripping, hill-by-hill, bunker-by-bunker descriptions of Nisei military campaigns against the Germans in Italy and France. In the process, he graphically shows how wars are \\"ceaseless waves of madness that [fill] the earth with graves.\\" But Kono's chief character, Sgt. Fred Murano, the leader and last of four \\"foxes\\" that wreacked havoc on the \\"Jerries,\\" and all of his other comrades, are much more than players in this intense war drama. They also carry and convey the anger, anguish, outrage, frustration, courage and patriotism of these young Nisei Americans of the mid-twentieth century and the complex, often tragic, traumas they faced in Europe and their families confronted in the United States. Reminiscing with a few surviving comrades at the end of the book, more than fifty years after the end of the war, Fred says, \\"We made the supreme sacrifice, laid our lives on the line. Not to go on the record that we are loyal Americans, which we always were...we know that ...but to win our own freedom as any other freedom-loving American.\\" Like King Arthur, who asked that younger generations be taught and pass on the glorious story of Camelot, Fred believes the Nisei role in the war should be passed on down the generations and fully recognized by the world at large. With this book, Kono has made a major contribution to fulfilling Murano's dream of telling that story, a critical but still little-known chapter in modern U.S. and world history. Even more than this, in recounting the Nisei experience, the author has thrown sympathetic light on the ongoing problems, not always as traumatic as those of the Japanese-Americans in the 1940s, that any minority encounters trying to \\"fit in\\" without being absorbed, in the United States and in other countries around the world. Though this book's most obvious subject is war, it is also a testimony to freedom from war in the world, social equality and justice in America and other societies, and peace, if not always tranquility, in the individual soul."},{"Title":"The Last Fox: A Novel of the 100th/442nd RCT","review":"This is the book we have been waiting for. We have read about the exploits of the Nisei soldiers and have heard the campaign stories. I don't read war novels but this one promised to give me the inner drama of the soldier.This novel does that and much more. The hero faces the enemy in combat, internment of his family in his own country, racism after victory, and after living a life overcoming adversity, a terminal illness. His values sustain him and they are the book's gift to its readers."},{"Title":"The Last Fox: A Novel of the 100th/442nd RCT","review":"The Last Fox by Robert Kono is a most interesting and illuminating novel. The story line follows the men of the 442nd and the 100th Regimental Combat Teams through their campaigns in Italy and France in World War II. These men fought with Medal of Honor courage while their loved ones and relatives were in United States interment camps. Kono captures the real feelings of combat and the personal valor of these fine soldiers,with great style and vivid metaphors. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Last Fox: A Novel of the 100th/442nd RCT","review":"Robert Kono's book about the famous unit of Japanese Americans who fought against the Nazis in Europe during WWII is an amazing account of the battles this unit fought, both against racism and against German bullets and bombs. This work has some of the most vivid, incredible battle scenes I've read. The way soldiers could 'name' bombs and bullets by the types of sounds and explosions they create (along with vivid details of the havoc these weapons created on the battlefield) make this book a must-read for anyone interested in WWII battles.The scenes where these men go in to rescue the Lost Battalian (an American unit trapped behind German lines) is a record of courage and valor above and beyond the call of duty.A few more regiments of Japanese American soldiers in Europe and the US Army might have reached Berlin ahead of the Russians. These were tough, tough soldiers."},{"Title":"The Last Fox: A Novel of the 100th/442nd RCT","review":"i suppose it's possible that men of the 442nd spoke as the characters in the book, but i just can't quite picture it. i wasn't in the 442nd, or in WWII, but i did serve in Marine infantry in Vietnam, and these characters just don't ring true with me. infantrymen are tired, tense, sore, filthy, and smell bad. they're thirsty and sometimes hungry. they usually don't have time to be afraid, even when the fecal matter hits the fan. nobody i ever heard (before arriving in the Nam) wondered (aloud, at least) how they would perform in combat. when they don't like one another it's usually a lot more direct."},{"Title":"Woman Suffrage and the Origins of Liberal Feminism in the United States 1820-1920","review":"An interesting thesis with good support well presented. Those who disagree with Marilley's thesis about the importance of various arguments in the woman suffrage movement will have a solid work to spar against. The book is an especial gem for those interested in the history of the woman suffrage movement in Colorado or mining camps generally; the thoroughness of her scholarship is an improvement from what was available before in Beverly Beeton's groundbreaking work."},{"Title":"Napoleon's Family","review":"Desmond Seward is a popularizer, and this book has no footnotes, but it is a fantastic book and is fast reading. It tells the almost unbelievable story of Napolean and his siblings: Joseph (1768-1844), Lucien (1775-1840), Elisa (1777-1820), Louis (1778-1846), Pauline (1780-1824), Caroline (1782-1839) and Jerome (1784-1860). What an immoral lot--one is shocked by the sexual excess thay all indulged in. This is a good book, with a genealogical table and telling what became of them and their descendants. But the way Seward writes, it is not serious history. But it is fun to read, and you will be amazed by how quickly Napolean and his family assumed the vices of royalty."},{"Title":"Napoleon's Family","review":"Napoleon stands alone as a towering figure dominating the history of his age, so it's sometimes easy to forget that he came from a large family (5 brothers including Nappy, 3 sisters). But *he* didn't forget them--like any good boy from a poor Corsican family, he provided for them when he was master of France, and then of Europe: obscene riches, dynastic marriages, crowns and thrones. This is the story of the notorious Bonapartes, their rise and fall along with their famous brother.Seward tries to avoid sensationalism and maintain a scholarly style, but his biases do keep showing through: he rather avoids giving Murat any credit for his military competence, and on the rare occasion that J&eacute;rme acts at all decently it comes as a great surprise to Seward and he then rushes on and pretends it never happened. Sometimes he almost seems to verge on malicious gossip--I think he only included Bernadotte in the family in order to have plenty of occasions to badmouth him. But compared to the more usual military histories of the period, this kind of more personal story is frankly a fun change.Where else would I have come across such an interesting character as the Emperor's niece:\\"Napol&eacute;one (1806-69) was among the most high-spirited of the clan's later members. Even more masculine than her mother Elisa, she went so far as to wear men's clothes, fenced and enjoyed driving carriages. She married a sensitive Italian, Count Camarata, whom she reduced to a nervous wreck before deserting him in 1830 and reverting to her maiden name.... Very much her mother's daughter, she later acquired a keen interest in drainage.\\""},{"Title":"Napoleon's Family","review":"This book, was mostly about Napoleon. The title of the book, is of course about all of his family. This does not let you down. You can read about all of his brothers and sisters, and of course his courageous mother and father. Not much usually is documented so long ago and we struggle to find answers to questions about history. This is a good book to read if you wish to know about Napoleon in a deeper aspect."},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"This is the third book by Woodrell which I've read and I plan to get to everything he's written. I love his use of language, his intelligent and accurate depiction of low and not-so-low life. With simple economy and smooth plotting, he unwinds stories which surprise us with their developments. I think he writes some of the best characters and paying attention to them and what they are saying and doing in the immediate action diverts us from seeing the motives behind all that. Kind of like real life. I like the Rene Shade character a lot and hope that Woodrell will keep him around for further adventures. This book is very well-written and I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"It&#65533;s lightning speed, raw, tenacious, exciting, sophisticated, witty, and some of the best crime writing I&#65533;ve ever read. I started reading Muscle For The Wing at 2:40 p.m. and finished at 9:40 p.m., taking a few breaks to eat, walk, chain smoke a pack of Camels and smooch with the freckled one. It&#65533;s 9:43 p.m. and I&#65533;m hacking at the review, as in, I&#65533;m still super-charged from this baby...."},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"I began my 'Daniel Woodrell' journey with \\"Winters Bone\\". A spectacular book. Next \\"Tomato Red\\" which I also loved.I have now read four of Woodrells books and I cannot say enough about his writing skills, with each book he takes you on a most surprising journey to meet some of the most interesting, lovable and some not so lovable characters.He is a master at what he does, no doubt about that.What is really a surprise, are how his books end, with a wonderful crash landing effect !You will not regret reading anything by Woodrell, and I sure hope he is writing away as I type this, because Daniel, I am going to run out of your books if you don't get a new one on the market soon !!!!"},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"Muscle For The Wing opens in the middle of a piece of action - a bunch of interlopers rip off a protected gambling get-together and kill a cop in the process. The killers, led by the intelligent, ruthless Emil Jaddick, are part of a right-wing prison organisation that has tentacles which are reaching into legitimate spheres of society. With The Wing behind them, they feel indestructible. What they're not prepared for is the might of the old-school crime-lord they're up against.Meanwhile, local cop Shade is chilling with his woman. At least he starts off chilling, for things heat up pretty quickly. After a night of passion, a week of camping the couple have planned is called off so that Shade can work the case.Because the town's mayor was at the card-game from the opening and because the mayor has strings he can pull, Shade is put out to work with an ex running mate from younger and darker times. The objective isn't so much to apprehend the gang, but to destroy it.So, \`Shade and his woman'; what's that about? It might not be a phrase I'd normally use, but here it's completely apt. The society of Frogtown where the book is set, is interestingly structured. There's an interesting contrast between a matriarchal world and one where women are regarded as objects to admire, have fun with and keep in line. The women are able to use this to their advantage much of the time, but when things get tough it's the rule of a male fist that comes out on top.There are so many things to love about the book.It has an easy style that's efficient with words and yet is full of wonder in the description of people and place. Here are a few to get the saliva going:Willie Dastillon. Could he be behind the robbery and the murder? \`Willie might steal a hen, but he wouldn't break an egg.' Brilliant.Hard man and crime-lord Beaurain. Described in one phrase - \`measured five foot seven standing on your neck.'Frogtown: \`Where the sideburns were longer, the fuses shorter, the skirts higher and the expectations lower.'And Wanda has a behind that's \`harder'married life.'It's a sexy book. An action-packed one. It's beautiful, violent, interesting and superbly paced. The characters rule the pages and their lives have damaged each of them.I hope I've learned a thing or two about writing with this one. It's quite superb. As well as a lot of positives, I've picked up that I should never call a character How - that can cause more than a few confusions for a reader with a memory like mine. How? Check that one out for yourself."},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"I loved Winter's Bone, but this book contained a bit too much graphic everything for my taste: sex and violence are fine, and there was a good bit of it in Winter's Bone, but this story is much more in-your-face, and more than a little too low-life. Maybe it's because the main characters in Winter's Bone were good people struggling against evil; while in Muscle, the good guy is much more of a minor character, and we spend most of our time in the company of very depraved people.Still, Woodrell's language and dialogue are as gorgeous as ever, other-worldly almost, and it's probably worth reading more of his books just to experience that writing. There's no other voice quite like it, and it's full of lovely surprises. I'm not going to give up yet."},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"If you like Rene Shade, you'll love Sammy Barlach. I read Tomato Red first and though I liked MFTW, it seemed like an exercise that Woodrell did in order to find that perfect narrative voice for TR. I tell people that TR is the first book I'd grab off my shelf if the house was on fire. No exaggeration. Buy it now. Woodrell is also one of those rare writers that when you meet him in person you still feel as much admiration/liking for the human being as you did for the prose."},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","review":"This is an early novel from Daniel Woodrell, the second in his Louisiana Bayou trilogy featuring St. Bruno detective, Rene Shade.In the parish of St. Bruno the local citizenry exists in an uneasy alliance with a gaggle of small-time mobsters who are headed by a local boss named Auguste Beaurain. A trio of ex-cons, members of a prison gang named The Wing, move in with intentions of taking over the town's action. They begin by knocking over a high stakes poker game that is protected by Beaurain. In the process, they kill a cop who was playing in the game, rather than guarding it as he was supposed to do.The surviving players and the mobsters are naturally upset and so are the cops. Even though the dead man was at least slightly bent, he was one of their own, and they can't sit idly by and let the punks get away with this.The mayor, who is in Beaurain's pocket, orders Rene Shade to team up with one of the local mob figures to go after the interlopers. What follows is a delicious tale of crime, corruption, sex and betrayal. Woodrell creates a great cast of characters and places them in a deftly-drawn setting. Atmosphere is a strong character in this book, and as a reader you can virtually feel yourself walking the dusty streets of St. Bruno and slamming beers with Rene Shade.This book is not quite on a level with some of Woodrell's later work like Tomato Red and Winter's Bone, but fans of Woodrell will not want to miss it, and for that matter, neither will most other fans of crime fiction. 3.5 stars for me."},{"Title":"Higher Forces","review":"A fascinating interpretation of how things just might be for all of us.

Also a perfect gift!"},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"The Six Messiahs, sequel to The List of Seven, follows the (fictional) fortunes of Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle and the man who provided the inspiration of the famous literary detective, Jack Sparks.I enjoyed this book just as much as the prequel, with in-depth and meaningful characterisation - some characters from the previous book return and new ones are created. There is a great combination of history, humour, fantasy and horror, along with some detailed information about the Kaballah faith.I found that the ending galloped to a sudden halt, however, and readers are advised to read The List of Seven first to get a better understanding of the characters in The Six Messiahs."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"Not a bad book, but unfortunately most of the other characters are more interesting and play a more important role than the two main characters (A.C. Doyle and Jack &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; Sparks). If you liked the hints at real and fictional characters from &quot;The list of 7&quot;, this book comes a little short in this respect, too."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"After reading The 6 Messiah's I came looking for more from Mark Frost, and was stunned to see less than 5 star ratings. The author combines a fantastic blend of thriller, mystery and horror with a taste of humor. If your looking for flat horror &amp; gore this is probably not your style. The 6 Messiah's pulls you into a story line that grows and twist with each turn of the page. I loved every minute of it and am looking for more!"},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"After reading the prequil, &quot;The List of 7,&quot; I was thouroughly disappointed with this novel. The same characters were there, but it just didn't seem to have the same inspiration that the first book had. Especially the last third of the book. The ending left so many things unresolved that I wondered whether or not Frost had actually finished it or if he had just gotten bored and decided to send the manuscript in for publishing. I look forward to another effort from Frost, and would still recommend this book if you enjoyed &quot;The List of 7.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"I enjoyed this book for the best part, but I found the ending left me kind of &quot;flat&quot;. It seems he got 3/4 of the way through,got distracted and descided to rush the ending. It did not have the same impact as the prequil. All in all I would still recomend it, but I hope Frost can get back to the standard he set with &quot; the list of 7 &quot;"},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift by someone who thought I would like it. I read it in its entirety because I felt obligated.First, let's be clear. Mark Frost is a successful and esteemed writer. He received a Writers Guild Award and an Emmy nomination for the acclaimed television series Hill Street Blues, and was co-creator and executive producer of the legendary ABC television series Twin Peaks.However, what is very clear is that screenwriting skill and success does not necessarily translate into the writing of novels. I'm sure there is a Ven diagram somewhere--circles that intersect in a narrow slice--that might adequately depict how the skills, training, and experience of a screenwriter intersect with those of a novelist. A few basic elements are like-minded and shared; most are not.This was Frost's sophomore effort as a novelist. His first, The List of Seven, has seemingly received better reviews but, alas, I have not read it. And \\"sophomore\\" provides a suitable term: this book might have been written by an intelligent and creative 17-year-old who hadn't yet learned how to craft an idea into a novel.The Six Messiahs, at its core, is an original idea about a confluence of disparate individuals--at first unknown to each other--who must come together to prevent what is foretold at the beginning will be a calamitous event of worldwide impact. A hook is that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, already of eminent Sherlock Holmes fame, is one of the central characters and is making his first trip to the United States.This makes for a great \\"elevator spiel,\\" as Hollywood pitch-men might say. Our hypothetical 17-year-old could have come up with that.In the subsequent inspiration and effort lies success.This novel was unsuccessful on so many fronts, I don't know where to begin.Frost is a screenwriter. He understands plot and, I would bet, storyboarded the events of The Six Messiahs before he started writing. In the hands of a novelist--albeit a novelist who would no doubt want to change the ending; more on that later--the plot could be made to work.But Frost is a screenwriter, and obviously has no training when it comes to crafting a novel.Point-of-view was the first thing to provide a clue that this was not the work of a skilled novelist. Frost opened with Doyle's POV in italics. It was a lengthy passage and should clue you then that italics were being used due to prose deficiencies.And later deficiencies there were. For anyone who has ever taken a creative writing class, this is the absolute poster-child of how to screw-up POV in a novel. This is the element that made reading The Six Messiahs most agonizing for me. Frost could not relinquish himself of his screenwriter persona.POV jumped all over the place like a hoard of agitated monkeys in an Amazonian rain forest. It went from omniscient POV to third-person to first-person and back again in the blink of an eye. It jumped in and out of the POV of at least 20 characters. I'm all for POV variance and experimentation, mind you...just not in contiguous, confusing, illiterate paragraphs. The whipping-around POV might work in a TV series, but in a novel its a travesty.What's even worse is the use of verbs. Frost mixes present tense and past tense within the same paragraph as if there's no distinction. Again, I assume the present-tense character in him comes out because he is a screenwriter. But the admixture of verbs is not only annoying, it makes the writer look as if he has no command over the English language.Pacing in this novel is atrocious. In places it moves well, in others--particularly in a denouement where Eileen and Doyle first encounter each other--it is a comedy of errors. The author indulges himself, seemingly at will, in bits of what he feels are humor. It doesn't work.There is a passage where Arthur and his brother Innes have a mutual moment of heartfelt weeping, and then manage to collect themselves. All the while seemingly less than five seconds of furious action has gone on around them.Which leads me to wonder if the author himself gave this novel a careful proofread, or simply sent a draft to a hired line-editor.The writing and construction is that bad.And how about the blatant historical errors in the book? In one chapter, \\"Buckskin\\" Frank fires 15 rounds from his Henry rifle in less than five seconds. The Henry .44 caliber brass-framed rifle could fire at a maximum rate of 28 rounds per minute when used optimally. In my experience, there is no lever-action rifle that can be made, mechanically, to fire 15 rounds in less than five seconds.Then, despite this amazing firearm and his mythological capability with it, at one point, \\"Buckskin\\" Frank decided he couldn't shoot the loaded Henry rifle already in his hands quickly enough, so he decided to let go of the Henry and take the extra time to draw his Colt sidearm. Think about that tactical decision for just one moment.And don't forget about the Gatling guns in the novel. They were an important set-piece in the final chapter of the book. Except that Gatling guns were never belt-fed, as Frost presented. Another fail on simple research.A good idea, but with too many characters (can you say \\"mini-series\\"?), absolutely no control over POV, poor language skills, bad pacing, and no bother at all to research the history of the period.But wait. There's more.Without giving the plot away, I will say this: Deus ex machina.That is Latin for \\"god out of the machine.\\" This is a plot device whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object.Deus ex machina. Something any self-respecting novelist would avoid at all costs.Mark Frost has penned a travesty of a novel. The real disaster is that you might consider reading it."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"Well, The Sign of 7 was a promising beginning for Mark Frost, but the sequel has much more troubles arriving at the same quality and finally it fails. Even though the story is well done, and its a pleasure to rediscover the heroes of the first book, Frost is unable in this book to recreate the same atmosphere of his first novel.Its a nice read for example as a holiday book, but it wont impress you as much as &quot;The List of 7&quot;."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"I loved &quot;The List of 7&quot;, but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment. The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story. It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. This is not a book I will read again."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"Though not as grabbing as the first novel, The List of Seven, this is still an fun and entertaining read. With the assistance of 5 other fun characters, Conan and an ally from his past join forces to battle a growing evil. With characters such as \\"the most dangerous man in the world\\", Frost once again entertains the reader with some exciting personalities."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"I read this book and I thought it was good at first but there were so many characters that I would often forget who was who. After a while I had to write down which character was which because there are far too many of them and I was getting tired of having to go back in the book to find out who Frost was talking about. I have never in my life had to do that on any other book.The only thing I really enjoyed about the book was the Japanese man (I can't remember his name because it has been a year since I read it) because I am into the martial arts.Overall, I'd say it wasn't all that good. Don't buy it."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"In looking at some of the reviews here there seems to be an element of wistfulness for the List of Seven and an opinion that this is not as good as novel as it's precursor. I was fortunate enough to wait two years between reading the two, so while I can agree that this may not be as good as the List of Seven, which was a six-star book in my opinion, this is still a great, wonderful, compelling, and extraordinarily fun read. It's definitely still a five-star book in it's own right and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. If you have read List of Seven, then keep on going and read this one too. It's full of occult forces, evil organizations, weird magic, weirder heroes, and our good old Arthur Conan Doyle, 15 years older and now a successful and world famous author. If you haven't read the List of Seven, then for pity's sake man, order it today and set aside a day for some wonderful fun.In the Six Messiahs, AC goes to America for a book signing tour and promptly gets swept up into a shocking and bewildering murder mystery on the German cruise liner that is ferrying him to the States. He reconnects to Jack, the secret agent, who is not himself and strangely withdrawn, sullen, and distant (probably the primary reason most people didn't like this sequel as much.) Upon reaching the States they are swept up into a mystery regarding the thefts of the world's most sacred religious tomes and must journey, along with several holy people, to the American Southwest to confront a strange cult and try to reccover the tomes. Many of the original cast of the List of Seven return, but as in real life, they are not quite the people they were fifteen years ago, for better or worse. This novel ties up the loose ends left in the first and is a very satisyfing and exceptionally fun read. Ignore the nay-sayers, you will enjoy this book too. If you finish this one and want more stories of AC Doyle battling the dark forces of the occult, make sure to get Thomas Wheeler's \\"The Arcanum\\". It's great read in a similar vein as this one."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"The List of 7 was such a fun read, I rushed right out and bought the sequal, The 6 Messiahs. I have to say that while Frost continues to be a good writer and settles well into his own narrative style, Messiahs just didn't live up to the expectations The List of 7 set up. Where List followed the life of Jack Sparks as the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes, Messiahs showcases a physically and spiritually deseased Sparks that causes the book to lose that Holmesesque quality. It's still a good read, and the ending was true to form and well done, even if it was a little short. If you read and enjoyed The List of 7, give this book a try. If you haven't, don't start with this book. It won't give you the full scope of Frost's talents."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"Although it has been a few years since I read The list of 7and the 6 Messiahs, both left me craving perhaps Frosts nexttrip into Doyle and sparks next adventure. I was lessenthusiastic with The 6 Messiahs, and thought it should have been longer. yet all in all both books were thouroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"Ok, so it's not the same as The List of Seven. But I think it stands on its own, brings great closure to the earlier story and brought back one of my favorite characters, Jack Sparks. As a story goes, it held my interest from cover to cover and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. If you read it, don't go into it expecting the exact same book as its predecessor, because you won't get it. But if you enjoy seeing these old friends again, meeting new characters and getting a quick course in different religions across the world, you'll definitely enjoy it. I am hoping for a third but it probably won't happen."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"Not as engrossing as &quot;The List of 7&quot;, but worth reading. I'd probably rate it higher if it had been the first book, not the sequel, as it suffers when compared to the breakneck intrigue of &quot;7&quot;. I would have appreciated a few pages of wrap-up at the end (it grinds to an abrupt halt), and I think I shouldn't have read them back-to-back (it made the comparisons less forgiving), but it's an enjoyable book nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"This book seemed so different from the List of 7 it seemed like a seperate story as opposed to a sequel. The story flowed well but seemed to struggle at the end almost as if the ending was written for another book or by another author. I did enjoy the book and look forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"I read this book a few years ago and the it still stays with me. Not in the way a work of art does, but more like a piece of bad roast you had at that hillbilly bar. It was supposed to be dead but you thought to yourself &quot;O MY GOD, it's still moving!&quot; Anyway, I couldn't care less for the characters and the plot (all 100 of them) was horrible. To make a long story short, it ended up in the recycle bin."},{"Title":"The Six Messiahs","review":"I thought the author couldn't do worse than his job with The List of 7--how wrong I was! The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development. Characters and situations seemed trite and confusing and the last part of the novel was a complete waste.

I was a little skeptical when I first started reading it; it seemed a little cheezy comparatively speaking to the List of Seven (total stunner, love that book). But after getting through that initial hurtle, the story began to pick up. I thought the ending, again, a little cheezy, but seemed to fit at least with regard to the Sparks brothers. The story lines were well intertwined and the climax of the book was full of surprises, action, and explanations. Not quite as good as the first book, but I would still recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Small Diesel Engine: Service Manual","review":"Summary: It seems to be an adequate specific reference for the engines it covers. It is not, however, a complete service manual, and it has mistakes and omissions. It is not the first book you should use if you are technically savvy but just learning about diesels.My perspective: I have been working on two-stroke and four-stroke motors for years, but I have never worked on a diesel before. I bought the book to fix a Lombardini one-cyclinder engine (a model specifically covered by this book) that wouldn't start.Example of an omission: I concluded that at least one problem was that the injector pump was not moving any fuel. In the section on the pump, it tells you how to remove the pump, but doesn't mention something I later learned about, an important warning: you have to be careful not to let the tappet spacer fall into the oil sump. (I later acquired a piece of a Lombardini manual, they expressed this warning in a simple, clear sentence.)Example of \\"incompleteness\\" as a manual: It was time to explore the guts of the injector pump; a part that was obviously supposed to move wouldn't move. There is an exploded view of the pump in the book, but the section goes on: \\"It is recommended that injection pump be tested and serviced only by a shop qualified in diesel injection repair.\\" It turns out this paragraph is all over the book. It turns out that most manuals recommend, or even warn, against opening up injector pumps. Fine. But I want a book that warns appropriately, then lets me go on learning; ruining my motor (after I've been warned) is my problem. Pumps and injectors are critical components and liable to trouble; a complete service manual would include at least disassembly, cleaning and inspection, and reassembly.Example of an error: The exploded view of the injector pump, though apparently supplied by Lombardini (\\"Illustrations Courtesy Lombardini U.S.A., Inc.\\" is at the bottom of each page in the section) is wrong, insofar as you can't put the parts together in the order shown. (In the subsequently acquired piece of a Lombardini manual it shows a different and more sensible order.)The book has been helpful, but it's not complete. I'm glad I wasn't depending on this book to get me out of trouble... I'd be in deeper. It has been, however, useful as I work on my engine and learn about diesels.For the generally experienced mechanic who is learning about diesels, I recommend as a companion \\"Marine Diesel Engines: Maintenance, Troubleshooting, and Repair\\" by Nigel Calder. It's the voice of experience and a good self-teaching guide."},{"Title":"Small Diesel Engine: Service Manual","review":"I own dozens of Haynes and Chilton manuals and they actually show you how to service something.

Oracle is sufficiently developed to be read on it's own, but it' much better to read the series in order.**The Penelope Bailey series is set in the same universe as Resnick's stand alone novel Santiago, a setting where larger than life characters face life not dissimilar to that of the wild west, except that in this case it spans planets. It's been fourteen years since the little girl referred to as the Soothsayer escaped numerous bounty hunters and other dangers and disappeared with the creature known as Mock Turtle, leaving friend and foe alike scorched in her wake. The Iceman, the only survivor, has searched for her on and off without success, until someone comes in with information about a mysterious Oracle, and an offer to hire him to bring her in. But what moves are the right ones when dealing with a being who can manipulate the future?Oracle has the engaging atmosphere and style as Soothsayer and Resnick's other Far Future stories. Whistler and the Injun are interesting, diverse characters and serve well as central foci for the action and intrigue of this story. And the Iceman continues to be one of my favorite characters ever.While the third book in the trilogy (Prophet) feels a little tighter and a tad better paced (Oracle slows a bit in the middle), the overall plot and story twists make Oracle my favorite of the three.

Also of note are essays on what we should do if we have contact with an alien race, a debunking of UFO sightings (much needed), a debunking of the cliche &quot;nothing is impossible&quot; with a listing of things that are, much talk on the speed of light and relativity, and of course a lot about space. The two most interesting essays in my view are one that speculates on what the Star of Bethleham (Clarke settles on a supernova). Also, there is the short essay &quot;God and Einstein&quot; which is one of the most thought-provoking things I have ever read in my life.

The range of subjects is quite disparate, and so is the range of moods, but the collection of essays is that strange kind of book for which these are rather advantageous qualities. Besides, Arthur Clarke has supplied most of the pieces with short introductory and concluding remarks in which he brings them more up to date, although this is barely necessary. Should the book be reprinted today, and had Clarke been alive, he wouldn't need change almost anything.To begin with, the book has one of the most charming dedications ever put on paper:In accordance with theterms of the Clarke-Asimov Treaty,the second-best science writerdedicates this book tothe second-best science-fiction writer.The continual exchange of friendly teasing for some forty years between the two great sci-fi masters is an epic story in itself, but it is certainly not the place here to elaborate on it.The conciseness of Clarke's prose and the daring flights of his imagination have always been the stuff the legends are made of. If you have any doubts about either, you needn't look further than this little book. Take the eponymous essay for instance. It is not even ten pages long, yet it is packed with thought-provoking reflections on fundamental issues. ''Planet Three'' is, of course, our own planet, but the ''report'' pretends to be a document from an ancient (and now extinct) civilization on Mars. Oddly enough, these Martians, before they disappeared from the face of the Solar System, were on the verge of their space age and had just mastered (or so they thought) the power of the atom. And there is more, much more, here than troubled visions of our own future. The main theme actually is nothing less than the nature of life itself. And the ''interplanetary'' point view may just stretch your imagination to its very limits. If extraterrestrial life does exist, why should it be anything like the one we know? There is no other reason for believing that than our own prejudices, and a good many we do have. There may well be forms of life in the universe for which oxygen is quite toxic and ultraviolet radiation quite healthy. (Indeed, under certain conditions oxygen is quite toxic for us as well, but that's another story.) Also, few things evoke a stronger sense of awe and wonder than to know how dangerous and hostile - from Martian point of view - our planet is. It is indeed a wonder (too hackneyed and underestimated a word, alas) that life has sprung at all, let alone developed to such extent, on our planet. Last but not least, Clarke is tremendously amusing pretending to be ''translator'' who presents the Martian document for us, occasionally spiced up with some perfectly delicious notes. In fact, the piece is as good as any of Clarke's short stories, and he has written many fine ones; it even has a kind of twist in the end. I know of no other writer who gives so much in so little space.Essays like ''Meteors'' and ''The Star of the Magi'' are excellent examples how popular science ought to be written: facetiously but not flippantly; for the lay reader, definitely, but not grossly oversimplified; with a good deal of facts and figures but not at the expense of important scientific concepts. Clarke scores on all fronts; his lucidity and clarity never fail him, nor do his sense of humour or keen insight into our mentality. Apart from a lot that you can learn here - did you, for instance, know what the difference between meteor, meteorite and comet is? - the more important thing is that the pieces widen your personal horizons enormously.''The Star of the Magi'' is a fine example for a mind-bending literary experience of epic proportions. Not only did this piece turn out to be the inspiration for one of Clarke's most famous short stories (''The Star''), but reading it is a full-scale mind-blowing adventure. In a nutshell, Clarke investigates what the nature of the most mysterious star in the world history might have been. Of course he is not concerned at all with the existence of Jesus or with literal interpretation of the Bible. He just offers several thoroughly scientific explanations how natural phenomena may have inspired the ancient writers. Having discarded the cases of Venus, meteorites or (to some extent at least) comets, Clarke finally settles for what is surely the most awe-inspiring phenomenon in nature: the birth of supernova. Contemplating the dimensions of such unimaginable explosions - enough to melt whole planets light minutes away and radiating light that will be seen even 3000 years later (and away) - is really the perfect way to teach yourself a little humility. It might be of some use. All of our terrifying nuclear weapons taken together look like mere fireworks in comparison.The essay is reprinted in Clarke's collection with non-fiction writings Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds! (1999) under the title \\"The Star of Bethelem\\" and cannot be recommended highly enough. Nor can the rest of this little volume whose merit is quite out of proportion to its size.To finish with the popular science - roughly, parts I and IV - it may be mentioned that all essays are well worth reading. Specialists in any of the fields should refrain from making condescending remarks and remember that these pieces were not written for them but for the educated layman. Clarke's clarity and lucidity are as constant as the pi number, and his tastes are as catholic as it might be expected. \\"More Than Five Senses\\" and \\"The World We Cannot See\\" remind me how much of the world is quite beyond our senses, though not beyond that of many animals. But even the unbelievably fertile imagination of Nature (not the journal, mind you!) has never, to the best of our belief at least, designed creatures that can sense radioactivity or radio waves. Imagine aliens who can. How would they view our world? How would we view theirs? As always, Clarke extends his reflections way beyond the Solar System and has tons of fascinating things to say, like speculations how the world would look like if we had ultraviolet or infrared vision. \\"Things That Can Never Be Done\\" explores, yet again, how dangerous the word \\"impossible\\" really is. Unlike other pieces, here Clarke addresses some things that really can't be achieved: squaring a circle, calculating \\"pi\\" exactly and few other similar problems from the realms of mathematics and logic. Mathematicians may cry indignantly that Fermat's Last Theorem is something they know since the kindergarten, but this is not the case with me.Last but not least, \\"Things in the Sky\\" discusses one of Clarke's favourite sciences - UFOlogy - and \\"Which Way Is Up?\\" explores the numerous parallels, but also some of the fundamental differences, between space and see. In the former essay Clarke recalls some of the most unusual candidates for flying saucers he had ever seen. Disappointingly, even the most fantastic of them turned out to have perfectly natural explanations. These range from kites at monstrous heights to occultation of Venus by the Moon. As for the relationship between space and sea, Clarke makes an excellent case that familiarity with the latter might prepare man for many a surprise in the former.But there is a great deal more than popular science in this book. Please note the word \\"speculations\\" in the full title. This is what most of the essays in Parts II and III are about. Now let me clarify one thing in the beginning. It cannot be disputed that sometimes Clarke is terribly naive, as in the case of his calculating ridiculously small prices for lifting man from Earth to the Moon; theoretically this may well be so, but the practical complications are enormous - and enormously expensive. Also, there is no doubt about that, sometimes Clarke was plain wrong. At least as far as we can presently see, there is absolutely no indication that cities or agriculture are on the verge of becoming obsolete. I am also inclined to admit that Clarke did overestimate the educational value of TV, even though he is by no means unconscious how easily such global power to manipulate can be misused. However, these facts should not be used against Clarke - who is infallible anyway? - and they certainly should not be used to obscure the truth. And the truth is that sometimes Clarke's observations are astonishingly prescient. For the most part, though, his speculations still lay into the distant future. But this, I repeat, is not an indictment against Clarke. It is against us. As can be expected by Sir Arthur, even the most far-fetched and fantastic notions in his essays are thoroughly researched and firmly based on real scientific achievements. If this is not quite the case, he always makes it perfectly clear where science ends and fantasy begins. We should do very well to bear in mind what the great writer is fond of repeating himself: the problems, in far too many cases, are political and economic, not technological.One of the areas where Clarke's predictions have uncommonly high degree of accuracy is the global communications. Since he was one of the pioneers of the communication satellites, this is of course to be expected. Yet it is amazing to read these addresses from the late 1960s - \\"Technology and the Future\\" and \\"Beyond Babel\\" - in which something very much like Internet is described in detail. Clarke lived long enough to witness this revolution first hand; as it often happens, it went beyond even his wildest dreams. He used to say that if his own predictions would all turn to be fulfilled in the near future, he wouldn't have done his job properly. Well, he has nothing to worry. Among numerous other tantalising speculations, these \\"communication pieces\\" also include the often-quoted \\"Clarke's Laws\\". I believe we should keep them in mind.[Clarke's First Law.]When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.[Clarke's Second Law.]The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.[Clarke's Third, and most famous, Law.]Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.Perhaps the most important part of the book, expectedly, is Clarke's speculations on space exploration. \\"Next - The Planets!\\", \\"The Planets Are Not Enough\\", \\"When the Aliens Come\\" and \\"Across the Sea of Stars\\" are well-nigh impossible to be described in words. They just have to be experienced first hand. The amount of staggering hypotheses is quite overwhelming indeed. Occasionally Clarke boldly, and self-consciously, ventures into pure fantasizing. But if history has thought us anything, it is that the future always turns out to be much more fantastic than we have ever imagined. Clarke's grasp of the matter is no less comprehensive than his erudition is. He discusses everything from every point of view, always acknowledging when he has borrowed ideas from his colleagues, yet never shying away from demolishing foolish opinions by other, usually anonymous, fellows. The tone of these pieces is rather serious, and their content is just about as disturbing as anything on paper, yet flashes of Clarkian wit abound, making his writing greatly entertaining. I find it difficult to think of many authors who are so stimulating and challenging to read without ever been in the least abstruse or tedious.Finally, of course, there are several pieces here especially designed for light entertainment. These include some of the most daring, yet plausible, speculations about the exploration of space. \\"Vacation in Vacuum\\", for instance, pretends to be a brochure advertising an orbital Hilton, with all possible entertainment that the best Earth-bound hotels can offer you - and quite few attractions that you can experience only in a weightless environment. The tone is firmly tongue-in-cheek but even the most flippant moments have very serious implications. \\"So You're Going to Mars?\\" is a piece of advice from a fellow tourist who has just returned from the fully colonized Mars to another who is about to visit the Red Planet. The piece is simply hilarious and can be made into a fine short story with but a few slight changes. Every detail of your weeks-long journey, from the daunting battle with Earth's gravity to the psychology of the Martians, is thoroughly analyzed and tremendously amusing. \\"The Men on the Moon\\" is perhaps the most light-hearted and mischievous essay here. It is certainly, and no doubt deliberately, very misleadingly titled. Instead of colonization, as one might expect, the subject is giving names to the numerous craters on the Moon. Under Clarke's pen, even such normally mundane matters make a stupendously entertaining read. If none of these essays makes you laugh at least once, I really don't know what could.What I do know is that one could go on forever speculating together with Arthur Clarke about everything under any sun in the Galaxy - and beyond. Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations, to put the matter briefly, cannot be recommended highly enough to anybody who has ever given some thought to the starry sky above his/her head. It is a fabulous shame that this book is out of print and everybody reads Bill Bryson. Granted, Arthur Clarke's scope is nowhere near ''nearly everything'', but his writing has subtlety and depth Mr Bryson has never even dreamed of. Knowing my uncontrollable propensity for quoting, I deliberately restrained myself from doing so - otherwise this review would have swelled to enormous proportions. But I want to finish with a quote, the penultimate paragraph of \\"The Star of the Magi\\", which sums up marvellously, not just this book, but Arthur Clarke's complete oeuvre:Astronomy, as nothing else can do, teaches men humility. We know now that our Sun is merely an undistinguished member of a vast family of stars, and no longer think of ourselves as being the center of creation. Yet it is strange to think that before its light fades away below the limits of vision, we may have shared the Star of Bethelem with the beings of perhaps a million worlds - and that to many of them, nearer to the source of explosion, it must have been a far more wonderful sight than ever it was to any eyes on earth."},{"Title":"Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations","review":"This collection of 23 essays on the future of man and his technology is truly amazing.

So when his grandmother treats him to a pair, it's a big event in his life. The pictures are lovely - capturing the rhythms of life for some South African children. I regret that there are not more books about them - and not enough by South African authors (Niki Daly is one of the few, and his other children's books set in South Africa, including Papa Lucky's Shadow and Jamela's Dress, are also lovely; Rachel Isadora is an American writer who has written some wonderful children's books set in South Africa).

Although this volume aims to develop and give a name to a budding field of inquiry, the chapters in Part I are devoted to researchers who have been working in this area all along.Chapter 2, by Herb Clark and Adrian Bangerter, provides both a historical and a contemporary perspective on reference, which is the ubiquitous activity involved in picking out an object for an addressee. Consider the utterance Put the small coffee cup over there. One would have to pick out the cup (presumably from among other candidate objects) and know where over there is (presumably from a gesture). Their chapter describes how reference was initially viewed as autonomous and addressee-blind before it came to be viewed as an activity that requires the coordination of both speaker and addressee. Among the features of referring highlighted are: (a) the multiple methods of directing an addressee's attention to individual objects; and (b) speaker-addressee pacts to arrive at a reference (i.e., to agree to certain provisional names). The coordination involved in referring is extensive, Clark and Bangerter argue, leading them to conclude that it is far from being an autonomous act. In fact, it requires more than mere coordination, it is an act that requires the full participation of both initiator and addressee. The chapter highlights how armchair reflection, field observations and careful experimentation have combined to lead to a more profound understanding of this fundamental communicative act. The chapter also provides an opportunity to appreciate Clark's well-known contributions to discourse analysis (the Given-New contract, common ground) in the context of pragmatic theory-making.For more than 20 years, Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., has embodied the aim of this book, by specifically testing linguistic-pragmatic theories using experimental psychological methods. In Chapter 3, Gibbs describes how his experiments have constrained theories with respect to four areas that are at the heart of linguistic-pragmatics: making and understanding promises, under-standing definite descriptions, making and interpreting indirect speech acts, and the distinction between what is said and what is meant. In each case, he has - like most accomplished experimentalists - come up with one or more clever designs that, in the end, either elucidate a given theory (e.g., the short-circuited nature of indirect requests) or force one to rethink a theory's claims (e.g., Searle's speech act theory with respect to promises). The aim of Gibbs's chapter is to convince experimentalists of the value of linguistic-pragmatic theories and to convince linguists of the value of experimentation.Metaphor is a classic pragmatic form whose understanding has been greatly advanced by psycholinguistic investigations. As Sam Glucksberg shows in Chapter 4, metaphor comprehension in psycholinguistics was initially viewed through a Gricean lens, in which the literal interpretation of a metaphor is given priority. According to Grice (or Searle), a metaphor renders an utterance 'defective' and prompts one to look for another meaning. In his chapter, Glucksberg argues that this standard pragmatic model persisted in the literature because its literal-first hypothesis resonates with an approachthat assumes that both semantics and syntax are primary while pragmatics is secondary, an assumption that is common in psycholinguistic circles. Through his and his colleagues' pioneering work on metaphor, Glucksberg demonstrates how metaphorical interpretations of sentences such as Some jobs are jails are carried out as automatically as other linguistic processes. He extends his analysis to other related phenomena (e.g., showing how novel features emerge in conceptual combinations like peeled apples) in order to show just how automatic pragmatic processes are in comprehension tasks. He concludes by suggesting that experimentation is needed to determine the correct division of labour between linguistic decoding and pragmatic inferencing, a central issue in current pragmatic theory. The pragmatic process, as shown by Sam Glucksberg, does not merit its 'stepchild' status; pragmatics is so automatic that it is arguably a module. In Chapter 5, Guy Politzer - who was often a lone voice underlining the importance of linguistic-pragmatics to the field of reasoning - provides a pragmatic analysis of both classic and modern reasoning tasks along with experimental results that stress the importance of the way individual premises, conclusions and task information in general are interpreted. For a notable example, consider Piaget's famous class-inclusion problem, in which children are shown a picture of five daisies and three tulips and then asked, 'Are there more daisies or more flowers?' After presenting a 'microanalysis' of the way the task's demands are interpreted, Politzer shows that young children (5-year-olds) fail to answer correctly (to say flowers) because they interpret 'flowers' to mean flowers-that-are-not-daisies. He also shows how a short series of disambiguating questions prompts even the youngest children to demonstrate their class-inclusion skills. Such microanalyses can be applied equally to many of Kahneman and Tversky's tasks (e.g., the Linda problem and the Engineer-Lawyer problem), Wason's tasks (the 2-4-6 problem and the Selection Task), as well as to individual terms like conditionals and quantifiers. The implications for this approach are clear: one cannot do reasoning work without linguistic-pragmatics.Chapter 6 by Tony Sanford and Linda Moxey reviews their previous work on the psychological processing of quantifier understanding and demonstrates how experimental approaches can inform linguistic-pragmatics. They begin by pointing out that not all quantifiers are alike. A large set of 'non-standard' quantifiers, such as few, many and most, convey much more than a rough notion of quantity or proportions; they have communicative functions as well. For example, polarity plays a determinative role in quantifier interpretation. A negative quantifier like few and a positive quantifier like a few have quite different effects on the interpretation of sentences. Compare few versus a few of the MPs attended the meeting. Few is more likely than A few to place the focus on the complementary set, those MPs who did not show up. Their findings show that the interpretation of quantifiers goes well beyond the semantics of these terms.Current issues in experimental pragmaticsThe chapters in this section extend both the range of topics one can investigate in Experimental Pragmatics and the techniques one can use. The chapters here cover inter alia disambiguation, metaphor and joke comprehension, promise understanding, the import of saying even-if, and the telling of time. All these topics are addressed using various experimental paradigms from neuropsychology, developmental psychology, reasoning, psycholinguistics and anthropology.In Chapter 7, Jean-Baptiste Van der Henst and Dan Sperber review experiments that test central tenets of Relevance Theory and in particular the cognitive principle of relevance ('human cognition is geared to the maximization of relevance'), and the communicative principle ('every utterance conveys a presumption of its own relevance'). Some of these experiments draw on two standard paradigms in the psychology of reasoning: relational reasoning and the Wason Selection Task. Others investigate the behaviour of people asked the time by a stranger in public places. All involve manipulating separately the two factors of relevance, effect and effort. These experiments illustrate how a pragmatic theory that is precise enough to have testable consequences can put previous experimental research in a novel perspective and can suggest new experimental paradigms.Orna Peleg, Rachel Giora and Ofer Fein give an account of the role of the context in accessing the appropriate meaning of ambiguous terms in sentence comprehension in Chapter 8. They argue against: (a) a modular view which assumes that lexical access to all meanings of a word are automatic and encapsulated only to be refined by an independent non-modular system; and against (b) a direct access view which relies largely on just the context to arrive at a word's intended meaning. Rather, they propose the graded salience hypothesis, which assumes that: (a) more salient meanings are accessed faster from the start; and that (b) context also affects comprehension on-line. Their chapter presents four experiments whose results lend strong support to their claims.In Chapter 9, Seana Coulson provides a review of the way Evoked Response Potentials' (ERP) methods can be applied to language comprehension, with a focus on what this technique has to offer pragmatics. The chapter is instructive in that it describes ERP's various dependent variables (P300, N400, P600 etc.) and the aspects of comprehension with which these measures are associated. Coulson cites studies of pragmatic import - for example, on joke comprehension and metaphor integration - including many that come from Coulson herself. She works from a model that predicts that processing difficulty is related to the extent to which comprehension requires the participant to align and integrate conceptual structure across domains. She goes on to suggest ways in which ERP experiments could be exploited to investigate other linguistic-pragmatic issues, such as prosody and thedistinction between explicatures and implicatures. Overall, her chapter shows very clearly how imaging can be exploited and indicates what one should expect from this technique in the future.In Chapter 10, Josie Bernicot and Virginie Laval focus on children between the ages of 3 and 10 and their developing understanding of promises, based on the theoretical framework of Speech Act Theory (Austin 1962; Searle, 1969, 1979; Searle and Vanderveken, 1985). The authors summarize a programme of research that has been investigating promise comprehension among children from the point of view that language is a communication system and that language competence is the acquisition and use of that system. What counts as a promise? Here the authors present two experiments investigating the extent to which interlocutors' intentions (listener's wishes about the accomplishment of an action) and textual characteristics of utterances (verb tense) play a role in understanding that a promise was made.In Chapter 11, Simon J. Handley and Aidan Feeney develop a psycho-logical account of the way in which people reason with even-if, working in a mental models' framework (Johnson-Laird, 1983). According to the mental model approach, many errors of reasoning arise because people represent only one or a few of all the models of a given set of premises and leave the other models implicit. They then draw their conclusions on the sole basis of the explicitly represented models. Handley and Feeney compare two possible ways in which this partial representation of problems might arise. In one, all models are represented before being pared down by extra-logical, namely pragmatic, factors; in the other, which the authors advocate, initial representations are limited to one model while pragmatic considerations add new models. They present two experiments based on inference making from even-if premises that lend support to their account. They discuss the implications of their work for experimental pragmatics in general.The case of scalar implicaturesThe chapters in the third section of the book focus on one pragmatic phenomenon, scalar implicature, which is at the heart of ongoing debates in pragmatic theory. As described earlier, there are two main accounts of these inferences. One assumes that such implicatures are automatically associated with the use of a weak term (as exemplified by Levinson, 2000) and the other assumes that the implicature is drawn out effortfully (as exemplified by Relevance Theory). In these chapters, four authors (or groups of authors) present experimental findings that lend support either to Relevance Theory or to some form of the default view.In Chapter 12, Anne Bezuidenhout and Robin Morris first describe how they operationalized the two theoretical accounts into testable pragmatic-processing models. This is less obvious than it might seem because it is hard to do justice to the rich and detailed accounts that have been offered by these rival theories on the topic of scalar implicatures. They then report on two eye-movement experiments that test predictions generated from the models as participants read a series of sentence-pairs such as Some books had colour pictures. In fact all of them did, which is why the teachers liked them. One can determine whether Some in the first sentence readily prompts Not all by investigating potential slowdowns and look-backs when processing the second sentence. They argue that the weight of the evidence favours the Underspecification Account (which is the one inspired by Relevance Theory); however, they argue that their Default Model (the one inspired by a neo-Gricean account) could be modified to accommodate their results.In Chapter 13, Gennaro Chierchia, Maria Theresa Guasti, Andrea Gualmini, Luisa Meroni, Stephen Crain and Francesca Foppolo present a novel account of implicatures based on the Semantic Core Model, which challenges a way of interpreting Grice's proposal that has become dominant in the field. According to the dominant view, one first retrieves the semantics of a whole root sentence and then processes the implicatures associated with it (in a strictly modular way). The Semantic Core Model proposes, instead, that semantic and pragmatic processing take place in tandem. Implicatures are factored in recursively, in parallel with truth conditions. They go on to present experimental evidence from adults and children that support this new model. One of the novel findings from this work demonstrates how particular grammatical contexts predict the non-existence of scalar implicatures.In Chapter 14, Ira A. Noveck reviews the two rival accounts and the processing predictions they engender, before summarizing his laboratory's findings from experiments investigating those logical terms (i.e., might, some, or and and) that could be interpreted either minimally (i.e., with just their linguistically encoded meanings) or as pragmatically enriched. His developmental studies show how children are less likely than adults to pursue pragmatic inferences, leading to a robust experimental effect in which children actually appear more logical than adults. Follow-ups show how task-demands, and not just age, can affect the production of pragmatic inference making, pointing to the important role of context in these paradigms. The adult studies, which include an ERP investigation, primarily explore the time-course of scalar inferences. Whereas participants' pragmatic treatments of underinformative statements (e.g., the time taken to respond False to Some cows are mammals) are very time consuming, True responses are not. Furthermore, time pressure encourages True responses. Noveck presents his findings as support for Relevance Theory.In Chapter 15, Anne Reboul presents a novel task, which she calls Koenig's puzzle, as promising ground for testing between the two rival theories. Imagine that after being handed a glass of wine, a speaker says Better red wine than no white wine. The puzzle consists in determining the speaker's wine preference and inferring what she was actually given. While referring to the two sides of the debate as localists and globalists (for the Default and Relevance accounts, respectively), Reboul describes Koenig's puzzle in detail and proposes a solution to it. Reboul then explains why such sentences may be used to test between the two accounts. Finally, her paper reports two experiments whose results show how implicatures are actually involved in the puzzle. Her results are presented as support for global over local theories for this specific pragmatic phenomenon.How to approach the bookThe chapters are representative of what we are calling Experimental Pragmatics. Each summarizes previous experimental work or presents original experiments that address topics central to pragmatic theory - metaphor, quantifier interpretation, scalar inference, disambiguation, reference and promise understanding, to name a few. Many of the chapters share common themes, especially the last four, but each can be read and appreciated separately. Our intention has been to illustrate how Experimental Pragmatics may contribute to linguistics and psychology, and to the cognitive sciences in general."},{"Title":"The Line of Forts: Historical Archaeology on the Colonial Frontier of Massachusetts","review":"This author brings out more great information on Colonial New England;although written for the Historian and Archeologist.If your a student of New England history there is much here for the amateur too.The Line of Forts in Northern Massachusetts were built by people struggling to maintain their lands and way of life,this book reveals the drama of those daily ordeals.

An incredible adventure surrounding the true account of Commodore Anson's small fleet intent on circumnavigating the globe. Some of the most gut-wrenching tragedies imaginable are tempered with subtle humor and sidesplitting hilarity. The fleet is eventually reduced by the ravages of the sea to one ship, Anson's Centurion, but it returns to England laden to the gunnels with an incredible fortune wrested from a Spanish galleon.You few million Aubrey/Maturin addicts out there will love this book as well as any of the seventeen in the Aubrey/Maturin series. You'll notice that his superb writing skill was wholly present then as now, treating us to every human emotion in his uniquely masterful style. I've heard him compared to Conrad in his ability to describe the terror of an ocean run amuck, ravaging those small ships,the desp! ! erate efforts of the mariners to save their ships -- and themselves, sometimes successful, sometimes not. But after going back to Conrad for a fresh look at his work, my opinion is that O'Brian excels him.Following this brilliant work is The Unknown Shore, O'Brian's account of what might have happened to the survivors of one -- or was it two? -- ships in Anson's fleet that were wrecked during the voyage.In The Golden Ocean, as in all of O'Brian's stories, the characters live and breathe, love and hate, are often courageous but sometimes are not, often behave as we would wish but occasionally veer off the straight and narrow. Above all, though, they are always true to their individual characters.Readers who lament that they have read all his novels -- thereby feeling themselves left dashed on a lee shore -- might do as I do, keep reading them over and over. I promise there is more there in each book than can be gleaned in a single reading. I'm on my sixth pass through ! ! the Aubrey/Maturin series and loving every story anew.Th! e Golden Ocean, like everything else from O'Brian's pen (yes, he writes with a pen) is an exquisite example of the true craft of writing.I put no writer above him in craftsmanship. Writers wishing to sharpen their own skills would do well to carefully study O'Brian's work. I shamelessly admit to adopting as much as I can from his compact yet radiantly illustrative style."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"The Golden Ocean was written in 1956 and is Patrick O'Brian's first novel about the sea. As such, it is the perfect precursor to the highly acclimed Aubrey/Maturin series. The protagonist of this book is Peter Palafox, son of an impoverished Irish parson. In 1740, Peter, who has never before seen a ship, signs on, as a midshipman with Commodore Anson. Together with his lifelong friend, Sean, Peter hopes to find his fortune. He finds danger and disappointment instead, as Anson and his men circle the globe through poorly charted waters. And, although they seize a vast fortune in Spanish gold and silver, only one of Anson's five ships survives the voyage. The Golden Ocean is as perfectly and beautifully crafted as are the Aubrey/Maturin novels. The writing is brilliantly detailed and the action perfectly paced. With The Golden Ocean, O'Brian has created a perfect world of must-read-on storytelling. A book deserving of ten stars and anyone's time."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"This precursor to the Aubrey-Maturin series is more memorable than some of the books in that series. It covers Anson's voyage around the world, in which he captured the fabled Manila galleon, one of the richest single-ship captures in naval history. I enjoyed it partly for its setting within this historical event: a particularly grand adventure. This was the 'dream cruise'(in terms of results!)that fired the hopes of royal-navymen, from admirals to ordinary seamen, for generations afterward. O'Brian's is a wonderfully rich telling, via two interesting and well-developed Irish character who interact throughout with actual historical figures, such as a very young Keppel. O'Brian's portait of the peppery Keppel was particularly vivid and interesting, revealing much about the Royal Navy of the times and the kind of men who did well in its selection process. The hardships and the mood of events on this voyage are well-drawn, and the story moves along at a comfortable pace. If I had a criticism, I would say that not enough time was spent on the capture itself and the story of intrigue surrounding it, which feels truncated and hurried. I wanted to know more about the capture and to savor their success with them, and I didn't feel that. They just sailed home. I think this apparent imbalance comes from the amount of time spent getting there. I like this book because it has stayed with me, unlike some of the Aubrey-Maturin series, as much as I like that series. Something about 'The Golden Ocean' maintains a hold on my imagination despite it's status as an 'early' O'Brian work."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"In the Aubry/Maturin series, Mr. O'Brian shows us life in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars from the perspective of an officer. In the Golden Ocean, we get a glimpse of what life was like as a midshipman and a closer look into the lower decks during war with the Spanish. Like Mr. O'Brian's later works, the characters are likeable but also completely human and therefore fallible. Newcomers to Patrick O'Brian's works might be put off early in the book by the British and Irish colloquialism and the seemingly lengthy delay in getting to sea and thus the meat of the story. However, it's worth the initial learning curve because both of these apparent shortcomings are actually the jewels that make Mr. O'Brian's books so great. The colloquialism is easy to get used to and adds colour (u added in honor of Mr. O'Brian) to the story. At the same time, the apparent delay serves to give the reader insight into what it must have felt like for a seaman utterly dependent on wind and tide and just as eager to get to sea. That's the beauty of Mr. O'Brian's stories, they really draw you into them.For me the experience of reading this book is a Microcosm of the Aubry/Maturin series, in the beginning I wasn't sure I would enjoy or even stick with it, but shortly I would find I couldn't put it down and was sad to see it end. I would recommend this book with the caveat that if you like it you'll love the Aubry/Maturin series."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"I've read all 20 and a half volumes of the Aubrey/Maturin series and will read them 5 times over as soon as I have finished all else that is available by POB.The Golden Ocean is just pure delight. I can not really add anything substantial to the praise from the other 12 or so reviewers, but I wanted to add my contribution.POB was truly a master at storytelling. Who else could have come up with Sean's version of the gambling/pickpocketing disaster story in the first chapter (Sean starting like a proto-type for Padeen, but then developing into somebody else)? Or the fluency of the dialogues between the partners in poverty in chapter 2, even if the actual story does not have any real surprises? Who else can jump time gaps with this efficiency at summarizing longish periods in half sentences (like the probably epic, but untold journey through Ireland with one lame horse for three men, which is of course the proto-type for all Maturin's races, failed or not, towards reaching his ship in time)? Who else can squeeze whole commentaries into one verb or adjective?

It's fun and it's educational, as well as being a great read.Highly recommended in its own right, but mandatory for anyone who is a fan of the later books. In fact, I'd finished the opus and was feeling rather flat when I discovered this book and its companion - The Unkown Shore, and the magic returned."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"For those rueing life with no more Aubrey-Maturin novels to read, \\"The Golden Ocean\\" is like a brief, passionate reunion with a bygone lover. No, it doesn't have our Jack and Stephen, but it has the familiar world of the British Navy's Age of Sail, brought to us in O'Brian's inimitable voice, this time through the eyes of two Irish recruits.He wrote this in the 1950s, well before the \\"Master and Commander\\" series. What's striking is how good it is; there's no bad first-novel writing in sight. Many of the longer series' themes are already being developed. A long and harrowing voyage. Navy discipline. The awe in which the captain is held. The names of all those sails and ropes. Carrying on while friends die of scurvy. Preoccupation with the prize money. Bad jokes and slop chests and wondering if you can get across the Pacific with two shirts. Seasickness and weavilly bread and the terrors of reefing sails in high seas.Irish himself, O'Brian spends far more time in this book developing his Irish characters. The first few chapters take place as Peter Palafox, a poor minister's son enlisting as a midshipman, and Sean O'Mara, a poorer servant boy who tags along, make their way across Ireland to the port. Their Irish style dominates their conversations with each other and particularly the personality of the headstrong Sean. One reviewer sees the beginnings of Padeen in Sean, but I disagree. They're two different characters.The trip round the world is as epic a voyage as any in the main series. Ditto the battle royal. The denouement brought tears to my eyes. The book vastly exceeded my uncertain expectations."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"Some of my friends, to whom I've enthusiastically recommended O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, complain that the naval jargon is too dense or that there's too much talk. I suggest they try The Golden Ocean. In the mid-1700's, Commodore Anson's mission was to explore the Pacific, extend British trade, and capture the fabulous Spanish treasure that sailed from South America to the Philipines. By good fortune, Peter Palafox (whose naval experience was limited to small fishing boats) was able to join the expedition as a midshipman on Anson's ship. Since the book is written strictly from Palafox's point of view, the reader is introduced to the jargon and oddities of the Navy along with our hero. After this book, one should read The Unknown Shore, which is the account of another ship in the same expedition, with quite a different fate."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"The Golden Ocean is the story of two Irish men who sail around the world in a British man-o-war in the mid-1700s in the famous and in many ways ill-fated voyage of the Centurion and its small supporting flotilla during England's war with Spain. This is not exactly a war story and the historical context is a bit unclear in O'Brian's novel. The sailors, marines, and their beloved commodore Mr Anson (later Lord Anson) are little better than scurvy pirates feeding off the Spanish shipping when they get opportunities. Of course, our heroes, Peter Palafox and Sean O'Mara, suffer all the standard ills and misfortunes of a four year voyage in a square-rigged sailing ship and yet ultimately triumph very satisfyingly.The best feature of this novel, the first sea story written by O'Brian and before his famous Aubrey/Maturin series, is that the author has the ability to create a great sense of realism. So many adventure novels are stale, unbelievable, and cardboardy, but not this one--emphatically not! Reading The Golden Ocean one can smell the salt air, feel the sails fill with the wind, suffer the despair of endless calms, dread the scurvy, and live the life of a sailor in the 1740s. I assume that O'Brian has done his research and that the historical recreations are accurate. They certainly feel accurate.One problem that I have with this historical novel, and that I have as well with the other O'Brian sea novels that I have read, is that the actual events portrayed and the running of the ship, and the dialogue, are all a bit murky. It is like reading a novel auf deutsch with two years of college German, or a novel or short story by Henry James. I am not quite sure that I understand the text and its meaning. There is so much sailor slang and obscure nautical terms that I am unfamiliar with (and I am a boater) that it might as well be Greek. I wish that the publishers or the author had included a glossary (there is a web site and book of O'Brian's nautical terms and sailors' slang that explains the numerous obscure words and phrases, but it is tedious to use).Also I would recommend doing some historical research of one's own about the actual Anson voyage before setting off on this novel."},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"After you have read all 20 1/2 of the Aubrey Maturin Series, read this book and Unknown Shore for more O'Brian"},{"Title":"The Golden Ocean","review":"If you like O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin books, jump right in; this is more of the same, in a slightly lighter vein.

O'Brian's description of the voyage, ships, and life at sea are certainly compelling, but the fictional part of his prose, particularly the dialogue, leaves something to be desired.The casual reader, unused to O'Brian's often inane descriptions of the characters' conversations, may understandably think from their speech that many of the characters had taken leave of their senses. Young midshipman Keppel is the classic example in this story. Given the words put into Keppel's mouth by author O'Brian, you'd conclude that Keppel would be taken away to the nuthouse upon his return in England. His constant repetition of the ditty, \\" a FILL IN A WORD HERE ho, a FILL IN A WORD HERE hee\\" (in China, upon being carried around in a palanquin, Keppel was reported to have sung out \\"A palanquin ho, a palanquin hee\\") would not fill you with confidence in this person's thinking capability. Yet Keppel, despite O'Brian's depiction, turned out to be a first-rate thinker.This unusual problem with O'Brian's replication of characters' conversations is undoubtedly part of the vast split of opinion of his work, particularly in the Aubrey - Maturin series. Most love it, some hate it.As for me, I've found that the definitive work of historical fiction about Anson's tragic voyage is the long-out-of-print \\"Manila Galleon\\", by F. Van Wyck Mason. It is still possible to get copies from used book sellers (I got one via ... recently).

(Page 187, \\"He had confined himself to the truth with Peter---he was terribly frightened then---but now he was no longer under that unnatural constraint.\\" See, natural wit infuses this writer's prose.)

At times more useful than A SEA OF WORDS ( which still need much more work)In particular, I enjoy having the map of the entire voyage included in the front so that I can follow things.

I suspect like most other readers, I regrettably had finished O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series long ago and was thrilled to find this and The Unknown Shore. Fans will enjoy the typical O'Brian writing but get a bonus in that this first one gives a more raw and powerful view of how a young midshipman's life must have been on a King's ship during the age of sail. We are told through the eyes of this maturing Midshipman how things work and explained some of the terms I wish I had know when reading the Aubrey series.

However once past the somewhat slow start , the pace of the novel describing the adventure of the young parson's son , Peter Palafox , the tale progresses nicely. Young Palafox has obtained an appointment as a midshipman on Commodore Anson's flagship Centurion through the good offices of his father and the ship's chaplain. He and his lifelong friend Sean have several misadventures on the way to England to join the ship's company and arrive just in the nick of time to sail with the vessel.The maturation of young Palafox into a competent naval officer is set against a broad tapestry of Anson's historic 1740 circimnavigation of the globe , spanning over three years. The crew of the Centurion and the small fleet commanded by the commodore encounter fantastic hardships and outright disasters on an unimaginable scale , only to finally return home with the riches of the Spanish Main as a reward. Some of the best descriptive writing of the entire book details rounding The Horn into the Pacific--called in the book The Golden Ocean.

Wisler creates a delightfully creative, painfully original tribute to children who have died. Just as meal times traditionally draw families together, even as food has always been a way to draw people together, Wisler portrays that tradition to honor the memory of shared meals, recipes and love in this wonderful cookbook. Bereavement is such a difficult subject, especially when one has lost a child. As Wisler reminds us, we are identified by our children. How many we have, how old they are, what they become. And when they die, be it a car accident or cancer, life never returns to &quot;normal&quot; for the parents left behind. We expect to die first but when our children leave, others are often unable to accept our expressions of loss, pain, and grief. But somehow, the grieving parent must find a way to live again. And with Slices Of Heaven, Wisler has discovered a way to bring the memory of the lost children into shared memories and recipes, allowing the children to figuratively live again. Wisler shares what makes this cookbook different from any other: &quot;Here, within these pages, the recipes hold the memories of children, thereby adding the best and brightest flavor to each of them. The favorite recipes are not just food, they are etched into the fibers of our hearts along with the other dear memories connected to our children. These recipes hold powerful legacies.&quot; Within the pages of this book, the reader is introduced to many wonderful children. Some of my favorites: Meet Billy, who ate meatloaf sandwiches every day at school for three years. Gregory, who climbed up on the kitchen table to scarf Caesar salad while his parents prepared dinner every night. Curt, the micro-chef who sprayed the wrong bottom of the pan. Jennifer, who could eat the entire recipe of Butter Almond Crescents herself. Slices Of Sunlight is a self-published book, and the proceeds from the sale go to The National Childhood Cancer Foundation in Arcadia, CA. I heartily recommend that all readers help themselves to a generous slice of this wonderful cookbook. For those who would enjoy contributing, Wisler is planning a second edition that will &quot;focus not only on recipes but memorials and tributes to the children we long to hold.&quot;Cindy Penn Reviewer"},{"Title":"Slices Of Sunlight, A Cookbook of Memories: Remembrances of The Children We Held","review":"This book was helpful to me as a friend of grieving parents. There is so much hurt and misunderstanding in the world of grief. This book helps people to vent their grief in a loving and thoughtful way of their loved one; remembering as simple a thing as their favorite food...something we all take for granted with living children and family members. What a great way to introduce to the rest of the world a very precious soul of the parents'. What a great way for those of us left here to remember the one who has died. What a significant way for those of us who still have all our children here to never take them for granted. Thank you, Alice."},{"Title":"Slices Of Sunlight, A Cookbook of Memories: Remembrances of The Children We Held","review":"Yes,it is a cookbook, but more, it is a tangible way to meet these dear children of ours who have left the earth but left much behind. This provides a real way to actually taste one of the things left behind -- a favorite food! The short writeup on each child gives insight into just who he or she was. How preciious are these sons and daughters. Here, an opportunity to know them better! Thank you Alice Wisler for providing this venue."},{"Title":"Slices Of Sunlight, A Cookbook of Memories: Remembrances of The Children We Held","review":"Alice Wisler has so thoughtfully written a wonderful book filled with warm and loving memories of our children who are no longer with us. This book brings hope, light and poetry to all who suffer the overwhelming journey bereaved parents endure as they struggle to adjust to their new lives. These recipes are poignant reminders that our children have died, but they also lived, and they will always be with us, but in very different ways. Alice's intelligence, her warmth, and her compassion for others shine throughout this book. &quot;Slices of Sunlight&quot; has inspired me and I recommend it enthustiastically."},{"Title":"Slices Of Sunlight, A Cookbook of Memories: Remembrances of The Children We Held","review":"I just bought Slices of Sunlight and read a little from it each night.

Bernard Paris' main theme is that Eliot's masterful rendering of realistic characters subverts her rhetoric about how one should live.Eliot called her novels \\"Experiments in Life.\\" The results of these experiments, according to her rhetoric, is a secular morality based on living for others. Paris illustrates in detail how her experiments actually show something quite different, often by demonstrating the pitfalls of selflessness. He builds on the approach used in hisA Psychological Approach to Fiction: Studies in Thackeray, Stendhal, George Eliot, Dostoevsky, and Conrad. While the latter book explicitly uses the ideas and vocabulary of Karen Horney (Our Inner Conflicts: A Constructive Theory of Neurosis), in Rereading George Eliot the influence of Horney is more subdued, as if Paris has so much internalized the Horneyan approach that he no longer needs to educate the reader in its details.The \\"Rereading\\" of the title is significant. Paris had been thoroughly converted to Eliot's philosophy of life as a student. His first book,Experiments in life;: George Eliot's quest for valueswas written from the perspective of one who agreed with Eliot's interpretations of her \\"experiments.\\" Much of the current book is a reaction, from a few decades later, to the first book (which I have not yet read). Few critics have the courage to share as much of themselves as Paris does in this book."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza.

Su narracion de la fiebre de oro en California al lado de la personaje es tan fina y llena de aventuras y magia.

The abruptness of the ending made me howl with frustration."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Once again Allende delivers her finest work. I enjoyed every word of it, except for the end, this novel will remain as one of Allende's most daring projects. I did feel, however, that the novel ended too sudden. It seems that Allende got tired of it in the last three pages. She was fed up with it and decided to end it. Can't wait for her to win the nobel price."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"De todas las novelas de esta gran escritora Isabel Allende,esta es la que mas me ha hecho volar mi imaginacion,facil de leer y super entretenida."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Allende's main characters have always been women and this book is no exception. A new flavor is added to the story of love, passion, and adventure, and that is the fact that Allende introduces us to some historical background as well as the difference between several cultures. Well written, I found that Allende was more mature in this book than in prior ones. And, as it is usual, once you start reading her book, you cannot stop until you finish it."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Esta es quiza la peor novela que Isabel Allende a escrito asta ahora. Los personajes carecen de caracter y &quot;vida&quot; propia. La manera en que Allende narra la historia es muy entretenidad, pero despues de leer unas cuantas paginas, te das cuenta que esta novela no tienen ninguno de los ingredientes a los que Allende nos tiene acostrunbrados."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"After reading Isabel Allende's brilliant The House of the Spirits back in the 80s, I looked immediately for other books by her. Of Love and Shadows was pretty good, but then things started going downhill when Eva Luna came into the picture. And this, Daughter of Fortune (Hija de la Fortuna) has to be the low point. It is little more than one of those pink-jacketed historical romances you can buy at the drugstore. Just because the author throws in a ghost or two and some Chinese medicine doesn't make this book magical, spiritual, or deep. It doesn't even feel particularly historically accurate. It's more like the writer just picked a random time in history and did a minimal amount of research into the era. Shallow, poorly defined characters don't help, either. Altogether a disappointment."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Fue esta la primera novela que le&iacute; de Isabel Allende... desde entonces, no he dejado de leer.

Yes, it was long, but I was not bored. There is a lot of adventure, romance, and history here. This book reflects the spirit of America - the idea of starting anew with absolutely nothing, eventually forgoing the restictive conventions and mundane conveniences of your country of origin. The book paints a picture of survival - human survival in a social and physical context. The characters must explore love, economy, friendship, predjudice, and pride among people from places they have never thought of before. In addition to confronting new social contexts in this daunting new world, the characters must also confront new physical realities including new landscapes, a new climate, new foods and medicines, new clothing, new architecture, etc. Allende leaves no stone unturned in this novel."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Empezando por el titulo, es perfecto, al principio pense que Isabel se referia a fortuna=riqueza, pero al leer el libro comprendi que realmente era fortuna=destino. Eliza, la protagonista, es una &quot;recogida&quot; en la casa de los Sommers, una familia de buena posicion en Valparaiso, Chile. Isabel nos narra fascinantemente la vida de la joven desde su nacimiento hasta su adolescencia, cuando se enamora obsesionadamente de un joven y al el partir a &quot;los placeres&quot; de las minas de oro en California, ella se escapa de su casa y su pais para seguirlo. Este es el argumento del libro: las aventuras, traumas y decepciones que pasa Eliza para encontrar a su amante, mientras cultiva una relacion intima con un curandero chino que la ayuda y apoya a traves de su odisea.

Allende ha escrito y, seguramente, va a seguir escribiendo obras clasicas y inteligentes pero &quot;Hija&quot; debe de estar olvidado. Cuando la autora visito a Seattle para presentar esta novela yo le pregunte por que su obra termino asi--casi sin desarollo del trama. Ella me dijo que si ella hubiera terminado la novela se la convertiria en una mera novela de romance. Temo que &quot;Hija&quot; ya es una mera novela de romance."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Allende takes us through a fabulous journey through the young eyes of this amazing woman, Eliza Sommers. Eliza is courageous, adventurous and full of life. I found the background on the Gold Rush and the early years of California fascinating. Even though the end leaves you wondering some things, it is parallel to what the book is all about -- the world out there which is unknown to all of us. Beautiful piece of work. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Not one of Allende's best efforts, however I still found the novel interesting to read. Set in Chile, China, and California between 1843 and 1853, it is an interesting mix of historical fiction; a social commentary on the British of the day; a look at prejudices in the USA; a glimpse into the chinese culture; and relationships which have gone awry. Alot of ground to cover in one novel, however Allende's talent for storytelling ties all the elements toghether in an easy to read fashion which make for an enjoyable novel. As always, her strong female characters and matriarchial family structure is present. Hija de la Fortuna is a lighter read than her other novels, and very recommendable."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Allende is probably my favorite author, and this book made me realize it. I expected a lot of magical realism like in her debut novel, THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS, and was slightly disapointed to find that this was a straightforward story, with no ghosts or magical encounters. But, once I got over that, I realized that this was simply a great novel and story. The photo on the cover -- it's just a photo -- but when you read the book, you see how much it stands for. I had never known much about the founding of San Francisco, the Gold Rush. So besides being a great story, I learned a lot of history. The main character comes to California chasing what she thinks is her great love. Although she lives her daily life, and slowly falls in love with another person from her past, but who is wildly different from her, the search for her first love carries her on. The details, the story -- it's what a novel is supposed to be like. If you find House of the Spirits too magical-farcical for you, this book might be the Allende for you. There is also a semi-sequel to this one called PORTRAIT OF SEPIA. I vote for Catherine Zeta Jones to play Eliza in the movie!"},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"Me parecio que Isabel trata de buscar una heroina que sea fuerte y liberal en su juicio.

Sin duda, nos ha dado unas de las mejores obras de literatura de las &uacute;ltimas d&eacute;cadas. Desafortunadamente, Hija de la fortuna no es una de ellas.El libro no merece 5 estrellas, como muchos de los reviewers le han dado, pero tampoco vale dos o una estrella. La verdad es que la se&ntilde;ora Allende es insuperable cuando describe cosas que conoce bien, como sus dos paises (Chile y Peru), su familia, su vida ..., hasta In&eacute;s Su&aacute;rez, (novia del h&eacute;roe y conquistador de Chile, Pedro de Valdivia, en In&eacute;s del alma m&iacute;a). Pero no es tan competente cuando trata de presentar una tierra estra&ntilde;a como California, o personajes de culturas muy distintas a la suya, per ejemplo, ingleses y alemanes. Tenemos que ser honestos, las inglesas no son tan ardientes como las que ella describe en las escenas de amor en la primera parte del libro. ......A veces me pregunto si las chilenas son tan ardientes.Otras maneras en que Hija de la fortuna est&aacute; menos que perfecto es en: (1) la falta de acci&oacute;n - algunos de los cap&iacute;tulos se podr&iacute;an describir como simplemente aburridos; (2) la descripti&oacute;n de personajes y eventos que no son directamente conectados a la historia (aburridos tambi&eacute;n); (3) la inadecuada descripti&oacute;n de la b&uacute;squeda del novio, Joaqu&iacute;n. Casi parece que, despu&eacute;s de salir al barco rumbo a California, Eliza no haga nada concreto para encontrar al amor de su vida, al hombre que casi le di&oacute; un hijo.Siento mucho no estar de acuerdo con los otros reviewers, pero soy yo misma escritora y - como tal - creo que el final sea bueno. Nos deja llenos de dudas y preguntas. Eliza puede hacer cualquier cosa que el lector desee.A pesar de los defectos, Hija de la fortuna sigue siendo el producto de una gran autora. Tiene muchos detalles hist&oacute;ricos y le gustar&aacute; (aunque un poco menos) a todos los que conocen y aprecian a Isabel Allende."},{"Title":"Hija De La Fortuna: Novela","review":"A veces sucede que, cada tantos a&ntilde;os, aparece un escritor que vale la pena.

The characters are rich and real. The story within a story technique really works for this book. It presents you with two sets of characters, two time periods, two different tales to follow. Both of them I find haunting and intriguing. Readers who don't always like happy endings should give this book a try."},{"Title":"Defiant Captive (Lovegram Romance)","review":"From the back cover:A magnificent desire...in a world of danger.Brand, the Viking, came to Ireland to conquer, not be conquered. Yet when Princess Deirdre first spied him, he was in a cage, brought back to her castle to be killed. As proud as she was passionate, as brave as she was beautiful, Deirgre too felt cage, for she was to wed the loathsome King Malvin. Now taking her healing herbs to the dungeon, she went to tend the Viking...and met her destiny.Brand's gentleness astonished her; his kiss set her afire. And when Malvin took her castle in an act of betrayal, she helped Brand escape, knowing it would turn Malvin's wrath against her. Then Brand returned with his Viking band to claim her, making her his prisoner, making her breathless with his touch. But was she the spoils of war, or his beloved? Caught up in a battle between nations, Deirdre was a defiant captive, refusing to surrender until Brand realized that love could not be won by force...but by setting it free.And my review:You might enjoy this book, but it depends on what you're looking for. If you want history (big sections of this book read like a textbook rather than a romance), then you'll find it here. If you want lust between the characters, that's what this book will give you. If you want endless fighting between the hero and heroine, then you'll find that here, too.But if you want romance, actual deep, true love between the hero and heroine, then you're going to be dissapointed. I was. I need more drawing the characters together than just \\"you're so hot I want you so bad that I just can't help myself\\". Ugh. I'm ready to give up on these captor/captive romances. They just don't measure up. If you do want an enjoyable captor/captive romance, I recommend A WOMAN'S HEART by Rosalyn West. As for DEFIANT CAPTIVE, I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Defiant Captive (Lovegram Romance)","review":"I found Defiant Captive to be a wonderfully entertaining read.

For a quick reference, this lexicon has not been surpassed."},{"Title":"A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament","review":"This is the ultimate reference book that should be in every New Testament Greek scholar's library. It is unique in that it gives the Hebrew equivalents of the Greek words. Other lexicons, such as Thayer's and Perschbacher's, do not compare with the scholarship of this book. The proof of this is that it has been reprinted over the past century.

Disappointed especially after all of the reviews I read."},{"Title":"A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament","review":"I disagree with the reviewers who say that Thayer is too outdated.

The Abbott-Smith lexicon is an excellent companion for the people that want a more recent work, but don't want to pay the high price for BDAG. The definitions are brief, but concise &, so far in my study, accurate.

Who ships these without looking at them?"},{"Title":"A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament","review":"There is no point in repeating what the other reviewers of this excellent work have said. I would emphasize that it constitutes an excellent concordance . . . and is the only lexicon I know of that mentions the relation of energeia to dynamis . . . ignorance of which causes the NT energy words to be mistranslated in English versions of the NT.

I would not be able to translate without it."},{"Title":"A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament","review":"This is one of the best lexicons for understanding glosses from a Biblical theology standpoint and from a reasonable etymological standpoint"},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"Already a master of the short story, Elizabeth Inness-Brown now proves herself to be an exceptional novelist as well. BURNING MARGUERITE is one of those rare books that lives beyond its pages.The novel begins simply: James finds his elderly \\"guardian\\" Marguerite dead in the morning snow. What follows, however, is anything but simple: we learn of the complex relationship between James Jack and his Tante Marguerite, of Marguerite's unconventional and tragic past, of what the future might hold for James. Every detail is related with vibrancy and relevance so the reader is constantly engaged in this touching novel of love and death. The world created here is as full and as real as one can find in 250 pages.Inness-Brown has an astounding talent for narrative and language. She has a deceptively direct style; the words are ordinary but the images and emotions they convey are extraordinary. Her characters are so expertly drawn that they have a depth and humanity that few novelists achieve, let alone in their debuts.I highly recommend this book. Although readers of literary fiction will be naturally drawn to this novel, readers of more commercial works should also find much to delight them. This accessible tale has a universality that should appeal to a wide range of readers."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"Alternating locale between sultry New Orleans and a cold and craggy New England island, author Inness-Brown uses landscape and 'sense of place' to skillfully enhance the depths of her already very complex and passionate characters. Fire is a recurring motif, having been responsible for initiating the series of tragic events that both unite a family and pull it asunder. Flashbacks aren't supposed to be a popular fiction format, say some, but in Burning Marguerite, they work. Boy, do they work. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"I was in the midst of another book I was reading, when a copy of \\"Burning Marguerite\\", came across my desk. It is the just-published, debut novel by Elizabeth Inness-Brown, who had written two collections of short stories previously. The author lives with her husband and young son on the island of South Hero in Lake Champlain, Vermont. South Hero is much like the fictional Grain Island where most of the story takes place. An island to be loved yet feared. With it's rock, flowers, green fields, forests, and leaden gray skies over the water before a storm. It's harsh beauty, a builder of character, as much as a bender of backs and tree limbs. It's deep quarries and rich dirt a place to hide, a place to bury sins.The sleet peppered against the window as I started to skim through the first pages of the book, just to get an idea of it. Much, much later the sleet had stopped, and the night was deep, and I just could not keep reading. But, my, my, was I hooked. What a glorious first novel she had written.The next morning, I immediately picked it up and began reading again as the teakettle whistled. Everything else had to wait; I had to finish this book. It wraps the reader in it's textures.\\"Burning Marguerite\\", is the story of James Jack Wright and his \\"Tante,\\" ninety-four-year-old Marguerite Deo, who raised him from infancy. One chilly snowy morning James Jack finds his beloved aunt lying dead along a trail between her house and the cabin above it that James Jack lived in. As the young man ponders the mystery of why she chose to die there, and how he can secretly honor her final wish, the story spins into the past, then back to the present in Marguerite's voice and in James's. From a tragedy in a shack on the lake during ice fishing that changed both their lives, to Marguerite in New Orleans during the Depression, a young woman finding herself, after running from forbidden love, and a violent act that ended in murder.After her return years later to the rocky island, determination steels Marguerite's back, and she sets her course; to raise and love the orphan boy named James Jack as her own, come hell or high water. The story of their relationship and decades long love for each other makes this compellingly beautiful, yet heartbreaking work simply, an exquisitely crafted novel.In \\"Burning Marguerite\\", the author has created characters that sing with complexity. moral fiber, and passion. And James Jack's lawbreaking final act of love for his \\"Tante\\" brings him maturity as a man that he had lacked up until then. \\"Tante\\" had finally set him free.This book will remain in the heart of the reader, like memories of a loving old aunt or mother forever.Marvin Minkler of The North Star Monthly"},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"This well-crafted story is the best book I've read so far this year. I savored each chapter-stretching out its 234 lyrical pages over many days. It cannot be called a \\"fast read.\\" A gifted writer, Elizabeth Inness-Brown fills her paragraphs with stunning and flavorful detail as she tells the story of Marguerite, \\"Tante,\\" and her adopted son, James Jack and their life on a remote, frozen island. It is both heartbreaking and liberating, and I highly recommend this book.From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" McKenna Publishing"},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"This is the ultimate tale about a mother's love. &quot;Burning Marguerite&quot; is a stirring novel about the exploration of shame and forgiveness. It is a psychological suspense about family secrets, heartbreaking love affairs, and most importantly, devotion to a young boy. Elizabeth Inness-Brown is a wonderfully descriptive writer whose characters are rich and complex, and whose plot is full of twists and turns. If you are looking for a novel with depth &quot;Burning Marguerite&quot; is for you."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"Elizabeth Inness-Brown's Burning Marguerite is at once intimate and expansive; unpretentious and ambitious. It immerses us immediately and easily into the complex inner lives of a handful of well-defined characters, whose lives entwine together on one dramatic day. Inness-Brown deftly negotiates a complex narrative structure that juxtaposes first and third person narration, the present and the past, and complex characters who encircle each other in a carefully choreographed, exquisite dance. Burning Marguerite creates a small, ordinary world and populates it with rich, complicated characters whose histories and hopes belie the apparent simplicity of the plot.In many ways, Burning Marguerite reminded me of Marilynne Robinson's wonderful 1981 novel Housekeeping: the thematic exploration of multiple layers of memory and the past, the creation in Marguerite of a strong, unconventional woman (much like Robinson's Sylvie), the frozen lake that becomes another character in the novel: \\"The town had learned the futility of fighting the lake for the right to have a road along its edge.... In places now the road became beach, and after thaws and rains, or during a storm it disappeared under water.\\"It reminds me too of E. Annie Proulx's fiction: the unremitting cold; but more importantly, the transformation of the most quotidian events into poetic ritual. Liz's careful description of ice-fishing (tip-ups and creepers and huts), for instance, is much like Proulx's use of nautical knots in The Shipping News.This is not to suggest that Burning Marguerite is in any way derivative; Inness-Brown's clear, clipped style is quite different from the more langorous prose of Robinson and Proulx. It is to say that for me, this novel is what the best contemporary novels are: a poetic exploration of the ordinary lives of ordinary characters; characters whom we come to know and care about, and whom we will remember always. It is a fine novel, and a darned good read."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"Every once in a while you run across an author that single-handedly reaffirms your faith in contemporary literary fiction. Elizabeth Inness-Brown's debut novel is a pleasure to experience. Her story of &quot;a love so hot, as to incinerate all doubt&quot; is wonderfully told and I recommend it to anyone looking to find a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"I recommend this book, highly! It is very rich and textured and one of the few books where I have cried at the end. I feel this book is a real diamond among all the other rocks out there, that people seem to be reading. Thank you Ms. Inness-Brown for writing such a beautiful story!!"},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"BURNING MARGUERITE is a wonderfully-written novel that draws the reader firmly but gently into a slowly unfolding story that will touch them not only deeply but also in a lasting way. Her characterizations are vivid and believable - her characters are likable but not perfect - and the tale and emotions are ones to which anyone can relate.... Elizabeth Inness-Brown's reputation as a respected writer of short fiction is well-established. With this book, she shows her readers - new and old - that she has enormous talents with the longer form as well. The story - and her characters - unfold themselves before our eyes, from two very different but close perspectives.Part of the story is told in the third person, viewing the life of James Jack Wright. ...The other perspective from which this story unfolds is that of Marguerite herself......As with all of us, there are joys as well as tragedies through which these characters must navigate on their journeys through this life. These joys and tragedies are universal to us all, and yet they are unique to each individual they touch - such is the nature of humanity, and it is with great skill and caring that Elizabeth Inness-Brown has translated this into the printed word. This novel is rich and compelling, intelligent and moving - and it is a pure joy to experience writing of this caliber. I can't recommend this novel highly enough."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"I read \\"Burning Marquerite\\" when it first came out. I was astounded, and so gratified I could barely stand it. This novel addresses intimate parts of the human experience and does it with grace, wisdom and controlled eloquence.The geographic reach of the story adds to its appeal, from New England to New Orleans, secrets and love are held close but held fast. There's so much in this novel to satisfy -- a rare blend of exquisite story and just-restrained language. This novel is truly finest kind."},{"Title":"Burning Marguerite","review":"This is a wonderful read, haunting, heartbreaking and uplifting. The author's crisp, sparse prose is captivating and compelling. Marguerite is such a complex, multi-layered character, at times your'e not sure whether to love her or hate her.

I simply don't have the patience for authors who feel compelled to describe, in minute detail, every snowflake on every leaf of every branch of every tree... or every spoonful of sugar that a character puts into every cup of coffee. How about a little PLOT, Ms. Inness-Brown??? I forced myself to read 50 pages of this, because it was recommended highly by a dear friend, but decided life is just too short to keep on slogging, when there are so many other things to read."},{"Title":"5th of July: A Play in Two Acts","review":"While I am not typically a play reader, I do love to go to the theatre. Growing up, my father exposed my brother and me to a wide variety of plays, from musicals to dramas, one-acts to Shakespeare and Wilde, Miller and Williams, but I have a hard time reading them. Maybe it's the lack of description, although I would hate to think I disliked something because it actually forces me to think for myself, to create the set and the costumes, the props. With novels and short stories, even biographies, the backgrounds are usually detailed so completely, the visions pop into my head without a second thought. That said, 5th of July by Lanford Wilson, allows an easy interpretation for the reader. I didn't expect to be able to get through it so quickly. I feared that I would be bogged sown by the dialogue, but instead was happily surprised, discovering a relatively easy read, both harmonious and moving in scope.Set in a farmhouse in Missouri, the play depicts a scant cast of characters, each of whom holds his or her lost dreams, misconceived notions about the world and buried resentments. The unlikely mix of characters includes the following: a handicapped, gay Vietnam veteran; his gardening-obsessed lover; his elderly aunt (and her dead husband's ashes); an eccentric husband and wife; a musician. A simple plot allows Wilson to develop each of these characters fully, engrossing the reader in their twisted world.While I would still rather see a play than read one, I'll now blame that on the atmosphere at the theatre, the buzz in the air, the majesty of the sets and the costumes, the sometimes brilliance of the actors. I won't shy away from reading plays any longer; I'll read others by Wilson, I'll be fascinated by Wilde (I'm positive), and I'll even give Shakespeare another shot."},{"Title":"5th of July: A Play in Two Acts","review":"First Edition, with Original Broadway cast of William Hurt, Nancy Snyder and Jeff Daniels! Also includes slightly later case, starring Christopher Reeve. In the usual playbook format, with bright red covers, of course."},{"Title":"Memories of a game-ranger","review":"Not since reading Three Against The Wilderness or Crusoe of Lonesome Lake have I found such a great, true, adventure story. Correction - I have never before come across such a great story.Make no mistake about it, this is one of those books that, if you are fortunate enough to find stuck in some far flung second hand bookstore, you will devour every word.Wolhuter matter-of-factly explains his life from about age 10 when his adventures began in a South Africa that was every bit as wild as the American West, but with the added dangers of lions, hyenas and other dangerous beasts.Those of you expecting to read something derogatory about the natives though will be sadly disappointed. Wolhuter, in fact, obviuously was not blinded by prejudice for he was not fooled by rumors of uprisings that turned out to be false. Fortunately, though, Wolhuter spends no time discussing the natives and far less discussing the politics of the time that led to the Boer War and so forth. Indeed, although he did fight for the British side, one imagines through his narrative, that he could almost as easily fought for the Boer side, such is his empathy for friends and his antipathy for politics.I found his investigation of the scene following a lion kill of a native woman and her child to be riveting - surpassed only by his account of his own harrowing escape from death by two lions.Memories of a Game Ranger is a must read. Hollywood will discover this story soon and make it into a blockbuster, perhaps starring Kevin Costner or Harrison Ford."},{"Title":"Memories of a game-ranger","review":"One of the few books written by a dying breed of man. The information held within proved to be interesting reading, even though it seemed to lack a final point.

As a field guide I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the origins of one of the world's greatest national parks or an interest in animals."},{"Title":"Memories of a game-ranger","review":"Before all the infrastructure was there for tourists, true pioneers like Wolhuter explored and enjoyed the region dangerously.

It's written for Exchange admins, with the purpose of guiding one through the exam objectives, not teaching one all about Exchange 5.5 administration. I spent the whole day before my exam taking the 5 practice exams on the CD that comes with this book, and I swear at least one or two actual exam question were right off the CD (or vice versa, who knows?)I think a particularly quick person could pass the exam with this book alone, and the practice exams on the CD."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"This book covers almost every aspect of Exchange that you will need to pass.

Upwards of 200 pages are practice questions and answers, fifty is index, 30+ is table of contents, the paper is a little heavier stock than most books, and the print is well-spaced. In other words, DON'T let the size of this book scare you off.I do have one small complaint. The CD is really kind of shoddy. I've had some small problems running the MCSE Study Guide Sampler, and more annoying, a lot of the questions had incorrect and/or mucked up answers programmed into the test, so *BE SURE* that you work with the questions and answers *IN THE BOOK*, not from the CD tests. For example, the book correctly answers a question about what platforms Outlook runs on, but the CD test only accepts that Outlook will run on Windows NT Workstation. (Yikes!)

As an added bonus, and as mentioned many times already here, the sample test questions were very similar to the questions that they asked on the actual test."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"Of the 5 Sybex books I used to pass my certifications (MCSE with Exchange!), this was absolutely the most useful for passing a Microsoft exam. It very thoroughly covers all of the important subject requirements of the test (unlike some books), and often covers them in dizzying, mind-bogling depth. Definitely have NT Server and a copy of Exchange Server 5.5 (and hopefully a second dual-boot computer) to _really_ learn with the book if possible, though.The book only lost a star because the author's unnecessarily long and sometimes pompous writing style was really annoying and distracting, and probably made the book much larger than it needed to be (I'm not kidding). Otherwise, it was well written and well balanced, with few errors.As a number of people here noted, many of the sample test questions in the book were _identical_ to questions on the actual test, but you should NOT buy this book just to memorize the questions. The depth of information that covers most of these questions will help you learn the basics of Exchange Server 5.5 and learn them well. $.02PS. The test was NOT Adaptive this time around - Microsoft has switched them back, again.

It is really what you need for this certification, it is clear, and the presentations are brilliant. It is the first book I see where planing is discussed at the end of the book, when you are able to understand all terms needed. Thanks to mr. Easlick and mr. Chellis. You did a great job !"},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"Just finished taking the Exchange 5.5 exam and scored 616. The questions on the exam seem to come directly out ot this book. The enclosed CD contained every question from the end of chapter reviews. It could'nt have been any easier. I was a little worried going into this test. I was told it was the hardest of all the test. This book made it the esaiest by far."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"If you study this book you will pass the exam for sure! The review questions are identical to what you will see on the exam. This books makes it too easy!"},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"14 out of 15 questions were straight from this book. Use this book and I guarantee you will pass."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"Strengths: This book explains Exchange Server 5.5 in a way that is succinct and easy to read. Many of the practice questions are difficult and challenge your mastery of the material.Weaknesses: There aren't enough step-by-step descriptions of how to perform important tasks. The book glosses over a number of important details about Exchange Server and its clients, making its coverage superficial in some respects. Some of the practice questions can't be answered without prior hands-on experience (i.e., the information in the book is inadequate).Bottom line: If you have plenty of experience with Exchange Server, this book is probably adequate preparation for the test. However, if you have never used Exchange Server before, this book might not be enough to prepare you -- you might want to look at getting the Microsoft Training Kit as well, or Tony Redmond's book."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I bought this book, read it, and passed the exam. It was that simple. The only thing that I did not like is - this book is just too wordy. Many things in it could have been said in a much simpler way than they are. It is kind of confusing at times. However, I think it is a very good reference for an Exchange Administrator. It will get you through the exam - and that is what you want if you are buying, right?"},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"The information is redundant, and I believe that I read the information twice throughout the book because it was repeated in different sections; however, I did pass the test and I guess that is all that counts.The information organization is awkward, some information is unclear, and the exam objective checklist was useless because I had no idea on how most sections covered the exam objects; however, I just read it, and used the review questions so I did not forget the key points, and it worked.I would recomend this book before taking the $2,000 Microsoft class."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"Bottom line: I passed Exchange Server 5.5 exam using this book, but there's a lot of reading and work to do.The book meets the objective but you need to do your part if you want to understand the material and get a sound foundation. You should verify some of the review questions with hands on, especially with the trusts relationships and the Microsoft Mail portion. Other than that, it's an excellent tool for passing the Exchange Server 5.5 exam because without it, you better have hands on experience to back it up.Great book and well organized. I can't give it a four stars because the information presented to me was too organized. I highly recommend it. Take it from an MCSE."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I passed the Exchange 5.5 exam with this book. The authors cover everything you need for the test (with the exception of one question I had on cluster servers). I had no prior experience with Exchange, and this book was thorough enough to help me pass."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I just took and passed the Exchange Server 5.5 test using this book as my only training tool and reference. I would have preferred better organization to the book as it relates to the test objectives, but overall this book does a more than adequate job of preparing you for the test. The questions were right on the money in many, many instances, and the simulations were extremely helpful. The Edge tests delivered with the book could stand some improvement, but were very useful nonetheless. If you can pass the three tests included with the book, you will likely pass the MS test.This book also represents a good value compared to other training materials. For about $40, you get a comprehensive book and three tests. Other test vendors, such as Transcenders, charge up to $179 just for the tests, which don't teach you how to use the software at all."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"If I could recommend only one resource to help pass the Exchange Server 5 .5 (70-081), THIS IS THE BOOK! It covers every objective in the exam and the end of chapter questions are almost the same as the real exam.

However, if it's an in-depth knowledge of exchange you want - this is not the book for you. Unfortunately, most people are only interested in passing the exams rather than actually 'knowing' the subject."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I only finished the first chapter and already I have to give credit to the authors of this book. The book is very straight forward and is written in an amazingly guiding style; it does a wonderful job explaining even the hard to grasp, technical concepts. I love this book because it keeps me interested in reading about Exchange Server, and it's not boring like some of the books I've read."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I have read one other Sybex-Network Press MCSE study guide which was for NT Workstation 4.0 and I feel the same way about Exchange Server 5.5 that I do for that one. The book is very contradictive. The reading feels like a different person contributed their own ideas of Exchange 5.5 Server to a separate chapter. One chapter has facts that are contradicted in the next one. Also, the chapters are very repetitious. Some of the chapters are like a synopsis of the previous chapter. I have taken five Microsoft Certification Tests already and I know that the questions at the end of each of these chapters do not even closely resemble any question asked in the actual real-life tests. I am very unimpressed with this book and if the Exam Cram were out already when I was looking for a book I would have bought that one!!!"},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"The authors really take the time to explain what's going on in Exchange, how things work and how they interact. This is *not* just an exam cram book, nor is it full of fluff to make it long enough, like so many other Approved study guides. I used the Sybex series for 5 out of the 6 MCSE exams - this is far and away the best.I echo the previous comments regarding the actual exam questions - they seemed mostly familiar. I suggest you work through all of them as you go, then use the complete test set from the CD. It should be all the preparation you need!"},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"My tutor for Exchange recommended this book in addition to the Microsoft Official Curriculum. I must say that this is probably the best explained book I have come across, and for someone who hasn't had any experience with Exchange at all, i've managed to grasp the subject very well. I've now left the MOC folder that the tutor gave and just stuck to this, simply because of the ease of use. The questions alone are worth the money... don't think twice, THIS is the book to study Exchange."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"There is nothing that I can add that has not already been said. The actual MS 5.5 Exchange text pales in comparison to this EXPERTLY laid out approach to mastering Exchange. I took the exam on 6/2 and passed with 933. Of the 30 questions I answered, at least 20 came from this text and another 5 were very closely worded. The remaining 5 questions tested general knowledge that this book prepares you for. Good luck."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I manage an Exchange site that participates in an organization across the entire Asia/Pacific region.

This is my eighth Sybex book and by far the best written of them all. Also no silly little jokes to make me grind my teeth!! Congratulations mr Easlick; cant you cover other subjects as well? Otherwise I agree with previous positive comments."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"This is a great book, not only for exam prep but as a reference afterwards. I agree with all the other positive reviews so I won't repeat their content. One other thing to add, though, is how well this encyclopedia of information is indexed in the back of the book. It's very easy to &quot;look something up&quot; when you need to. I also read Redmond's Exchange Server 5.5 book, also a good resource but (in contrast) suffers from poor indexing (but goes much more in depth, as well), and also the MS Exchange connectivity guide. I completed a major Mail to Exchange conversion before taking the exam (good education in itself), and referenced these three books often.The excellent questions on the cd make this book not just a bargain but a steal. I had the new 30 question exam (no more easy adaptive questions), and scored well. I like what MS is doing to make this exam 'respectful' again."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"I just passed the certification exam and owe a lot to this book. I took the Microsoft class and Microsoft curriculum is usually hard to follow. This Sybex book provides a better flow of topics and also a better discussion of Exchange concepts. Review questions at the end of each chapter definitely help to reinforce the material. The accompanying CD is pretty good. Only complaint with the practice exams is the lack of explanation on why answers are correct or incorrect (like Transcender does). Overall, a great tool to help you pass the exam! That's what it's all about, isn't it?"},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"This book has everything you need to pass the exam.

Has minor two faults though: First, there is no explanation of the wrong answers in the tests, second, the questions on the CD-rom is the same as in the book and several of them is repeated in the same test which makes the final score useless. The test program has the option to save the test which is nice because the three tests on the CD has over 120 questions each - but there is no option restore, strange. But that is still minor errors.I would recommend this book to everyone who want's not only to pass the test, but also want's to learn Exchange Server 5.5."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"Passed the exam on May 22nd with an 833. Of all the study/review guides that I have used for both the MCSE and CNE this book is the BEST. Especially since I have zero Exchange experience. Several of the questions and sinerios that are in the study guide showed up on the test. This book is very easy reading, which really helps alot. With this book along with the Transender Test you should pass this test, but don't take it lightly as there is alot of material to know for this exam. Good luck to all you future MCSE's."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"As far as content, I found this book to be mediocre, ambiguous, and redundant.

I passed exchange 3 weeks ago with a 700, hey it was good enough! I was laughing out loud during the exam! It was my 7th MS exam to date. Forget Transcenders and brain dumps."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"Having used Exchange 5.5 for over a year, I knew how complicated the test might be, but this book really showed the things I needed to know to pass.

This book is very comprehensive and well researched."},{"Title":"MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide","review":"This book is pretty thick, it's nice that it covers everything so fully, but I though it gave too much information.

It is a comprehensive book, it covers all you need in the exam. I believe that the author done a great job. The review questions are fit to the exam. The illustrations in the book also make my concept clearer. The book is a little bit think, but the content organized in a good way. Although some concept or content is repeated and repeated, I would like it because it can refresh my mind and I need not to turn the pages many times.

The questions on the test are no longer a reflection of the review questions.

The Author brings these characters to life in such a way you can almost see them. A great family book for all."},{"Title":"Moliere's Tartuffe or the Impostor","review":"I often taught Moliere's \\"Tartuffe\\" as an example of the neoclassical form of comedy in contrast to the romantic comedy represented by Shakespeare. We would read \\"Twelfth Night,\\" a play set in a faraway exotic land where the point was simply romance, and then turn to \\"Tartuffe,\\" where the contemporary society becomes one of the primary concerns of the comic dramatist. During the neoclassical period society was concerned with norms of behavior, and in a Moliere play you usually find a eccentric individual, out of step with the rest of society, who is laughed back to the right position. Moliere was concerned with social problems, which was while this particular play, dealing with the issue of hypocrisy, was banned for years. Keep in mind that originally hypocrisy was specific to religion, although today it can be used with regards to politics, sex, or even uncontroversial subjects. Consequently, the idea of characterizing Tartuffe as an imposter, would miss the point; he might be misrepresenting himself, but he is, indeed, Tartuffe.The central character in \\"Tartuffe\\" is not the title character, but Orgon, a reasonably well to do man of Paris who is married to his second wife, Elmire, and has a song, Damis, and a daughter, Mariane, from his first marriage. He also has the misfortune of living with his mother, Madame Pernelle. Tartuffe is a religious hypocrite who worms his way into Orgon's confidence in order to take him for everything he is worth. Orgon is completely duped, and disinherits his son when Damis tries to prove Tartuffe is fraud. The other key character in the play is Dorine, who is Mariane's maid and the smartest person in the house, which allows her to both manipulate the action and comment on the play.There are three crucial scenes in the play that readers should appreciate, even if it will not be covered on a future exam. The first is the opening scene (in Moliere's comedies the scene changes every time a character enters or exits) where we are introduced to Madame Pernelle, who promptly proceeds to criticize everybody in Orgon's household while praising Tartuffe. The result is that because she is so obnoxious, we have a low opinion of Tartuffe before he ever appears on stage. So, in addition to being a funny scene, it serves an important function in terms of the play. The second key scene comes when Orgon realizes he has been duped, and instead of continuing to ridicule his central character, Moliere turns him into a sympathetic figure. We laugh at Orgon while he does not have a clue as to his culpability in his coming demise, but once he starts to lose everything we stop laughing.The final scene of interest, for mostly reasons external to the story, is the conclusion, where Moliere pulls what could only be called a \\"roi ex machina.\\" This is because instead of dropping a god out of the sky in the manner of Euripides, Moliere has a representatative of the King arrive to set everything to rights. Tartuffe might pull the wool over the eyes of ordinary folk, but the King--in this case, King Louis XIV--is not fooled. The play \\"Tartuffe\\" was banned by the clergy after its first performance because it was seen as a thinly veiled attack against the Jansenists (a rather puritanical Catholic sect), and Moliere literally spent years rewriting it before the King gave his approval. It is not surprising that the playwright makes his patron the hero at the end of the play.If you are only going to read (or teach) one Moliere play, then my choice would be \\"Tartuffe,\\" even over \\"The Misanthrope,\\" \\"The Imaginary Invalid,\\" or \\"The Bourgeois Gentleman.\\" I would argue that \\"Tartuffe\\" is the paradigmatic Moliere play, which best represents his comic techniques while also having a historical context that speaks to the tenor of the times in which he wrote. I also think it is the funniest of his plays."},{"Title":"Hangman's Diary, Being the Journal of Master Franz Schmidt Public Executioner of Nuremberg, 1573-1617","review":"Franz Schmidt's diary is written in a pity, vigorous style which probably reflects the way he went about his unenviable business.

The resulting combination therefore did the trick one dull weekend. It worked for me.For connoisseurs of the airport lounge bookstore novel, this is certainly not in the ranks of Michael Crichton or John Grisham, but it certainly does work well in that genre, and I didn't close the last page feeling that I had wasted the time I was trying to waste."},{"Title":"In Restraint of Trade: The Business Campaign Against Competition, 1918-1938","review":"This book is an excellent study of how business collaborated with government during the New Deal era.

In this case, that principle was the equal protection of the laws. For a relatively small cabal to acquire the power to regulate the remainder of their industry, and to force compliance with those regulations, required a special status under the law for the favored class, and a special duty under the law for the regulated class. This was and continues to be an outrageous injustice ensuring enabling some to always succeed - with minimal effort - while the remainder will succeed to a far lesser degree than their efforts might otherwise justify.Great historical resource."},{"Title":"Menace to Society: Political-Criminal Collaboration Around the World","review":"As I am studying on line for my under-graduate degree I impulsively purchased a book on amazon.com for an assignment.Even though it was just before Christmas (a really busy postal period) I received my purchase well before my assignment was due.

This book recounts life at the ruins of the ranger in charge and his new bride. Letters written by Courtney to her family and friends reveal a simple and exciting life in Arizona, while living in two rooms of an actual Sinagua ruin. This book would probably be especially fascinating to those who live in Arizona or visit frequently."},{"Title":"Letters from Wupatki","review":"This little book is no page turner, but if you're interested in diary writing or if you're an armchair archaeologist (like myself) you'll get a kick out of it.The writer of the letters actually spent a number of years living on what is now the Wupatki grounds, just north of Flagstaff, AZ. Wupatki is a great place to visit--it's an amazing scattering of those magical stone dwellings left by some of the original inhabitants of the southwest.She is a somewhat naive writer...and that is both the charm and the downfall of this little book. You can get a lot through her, that you might be filtered out by a more experienced writer. On the other hand, there is much of the mundane in these letters. This is somewhat mitigated by the situation in which the mundane occurs.Read it to learn more about the inhabitants of the grounds, read it to learn a bit about our governmental custodianship of the land and read it to learn a little about life during wartimes.

At the time they actually lived in, and later beside, the monument itself.If you love the Flagstaff area of Arizona, or the southwest in general, or are just an armchair adventurer, you'll probably enjoy it just as much.Also, I beleive this is a \\"must read\\" for National Park aficionados."},{"Title":"Rama","review":"&quot;Beautifully descriptive, nonstop action novel on the Hindu epic Ramayana, artfully weaving in strong themes on the environment and peace,&quot; American Library Association's Booklist."},{"Title":"The Satisfaction of Christ: Studies in the Atonement","review":"I just read first few chapters of this book and have to keep reading them over and over again.The insight on the atonement(satisfaction) of Christ is just incredible.I have read 1000's of christian books and never read one as deep as this.This is a must buy."},{"Title":"Defining the Really Great Boss","review":"This guy doesn't have the foggiest clue how to be a good manager.

Meaning that it is not the easiest of reads and it is definitely not a \\"how-to\\" book. On the other hand it should be helpful to those interested in looking at different strategic approaches to be used in different situations. I think my two biggest complaints are that there are not summaries of each chapter and that the history of boycotts is attached at the end of the book.I teach Business Administration at the University of Southern Mississippi and was interested in the how-to's of boycotts. While the internet is filled with pages on how-to organize boycotts there is precious little info on what makes for EFFECTIVE boycotts. One Size does NOT Fit All!This book fills that gap by providing stories of past boycotts, how they were organized, and describing their effectiveness. My favorite story in Friedman's book was of Rev. Don Wildmon's attempts to clean up television programming and how he backed into an extremely effective method of keeping the targets of the boycott a secret (be advised this only worked because of the size of his operation and some unusual factors that he was not in control of). Wildmon's response to the TV networks claims of \\"censorship\\" is the basis for all consumer boycotts in a free society.From a lay reader perspective, I would recommend that any reader avoid reading the book in order. Rather, read the book's first chapter (definitions), second chapter (factors affecting success), last chapter (historical perspective on tactics) and then the rest of the book or the parts that you feel are most applicable to your situation.I also recommend reading each chapter and then making a summary of what you learned (on index cards would probably be best) so that you don't have to re-read the entire book at a later date looking for the parts that are interesting to you.It may seem that I am nit-picking this book to death, but Forewarned is Fore-armed. Aside from the drawbacks I have described, there aren't many other choices for those considering boycotts to consult that have the breadth of Friedman's book. It is an important contribution to the study of various types of consumer boycotts and their effectiveness and will likely be the standard text on the subject for at least a decade."},{"Title":"SPENCER BRADE, M.D.","review":"Since Amazon didn't post an editorial review, here's the description from the back of the book to help you decide if this book is for you: \\"Married in name only .... the marriage of Spencer Brade, M.D., to Carol Grahame was one of simple convenience.

The homework assignments (on which I ?uh- consulted) were interesting, comprehensive, and touched on a number of important subjects, so I bought their book.The Analysis of Structured Securities - Precise Risk Measurement and Capital Allocation provides reference and background material on a number of quantitative ABS analytic tools, some of which I was familiar with and some which I should have been. Matrix math, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Markov chains, Cholesky decomposition, Tchebychev polynomials, covariance and correlation and numerous other statistical techniques are addressed as ABS analytical techniques and not as mathematically rarefied numerical analysis procedures.But what I found most valuable was the focus on reduction-in-yield as the benchmark metric for ABS credit quality. Rather than credit ratings being an ex ante, handed-down-from-on-high, assumed-to-be-valid-within-a-notch-or-two inputs (which, I blush to admit, is how I too often think of them), the book points out how credit ratings should be thought of as a continuous, dynamic variable, interacting with the coupon, yield, prepayment vector, default vector, and triggers. The interactions are determined by cash flow modeling and Monte Carlo simulations, using the techniques mentioned above.Given this framework and tools, the book discusses how to efficiently optimize the structured security. I have had ABS issuers ask if there were not a way to optimize securitizations beyond what they suspiciously perceived as Wall Street cookie cutter structures. Previously, I have just shrugged. Now I know how to help them."},{"Title":"The Analysis of Structured Securities: Precise Risk Measurement and Capital Allocation","review":"Written for financial engineers, this book nevertheless can also be read profitably by anyone interested in mathematical modeling or mathematical finance. The authors discuss in fair detail the science of structured securities, which are financial products that are becoming more important as investors and financial firms continue to find more intricate ways of dealing with risk. For non-experts (such as this reviewer) in the field of structured finance, the book requires careful reading and attention to detail. Readers are expected to have an understanding of various mathematical topics such as Markov chains, linear algebra, Monte Carlo simulation, and probability and statistics.As an investment strategy, the authors describe structured securities as performing best in \\"controlled\\" environments. This involves the use of \`transaction documents', which are used to keep their performance within an expected range, and also \`macro-level' controls to assist in dealing with event shocks. The basic idea of a structured security is to assemble a credit or investment package from a variety of sources and allow them to be administered by third parties. This entails that the sources (the transferors) be completely decoupled from the transferee, the latter of which is called a \`special purpose entity' (SPE), and which has an extremely low likelihood of becoming insolvent by its own activities. The SPE is an analogue of the obligor, and is also shielded from the consequences of the insolvency of a related party. Its assets are thus \`perfected' against the claims of the transferor.Early in the book the authors describe what they consider to be the two types of structured securities. The first, called the \`long-term transaction model' applies to asset-backed, mortgage-backed, and collateralized debt issues with maturity at least one year. The second, called the \`short-term transaction model' applies to asset-backed commercial paper markets.If structured securities are to be used as an investment strategy, their value must be assessed in as fine a detail as possible. This assessment is of course the main goal behind the authors' book, and they therefore spend a fair amount of time in explaining why the usual credit rating strategies are inadequate for structured securities. One of those discussed is \`benchmark pool analysis' which does not require a large volume of data and uses a microeconomic model of the obligors in a collateral pool to simulate the financial impact of economic shocks. Others discussed include the actuarial method, used for asset-backed and mortgage-backed transactions, and the default method, which is used for collateralized debt obligations.The most interesting discussions take place when the authors attempt to formulate a more exact, analytical notion of rating for structured securities than what is available with the usual corporate rating model. Essentially the authors are advocating a \\"unification\\" of credit and market risk in structured finance in their attempt to replace the alphanumeric scale of the usual corporate credit rating by a numerical scale (they motivate this interestingly by discussion involving the \`continuum hypothesis' from set theory). Most important in their approach is to view the pricing of structured securities as a nonlinear problem: rating and pricing are entangled with each other, in that to obtain the rating the promised yield must be known; but to find the yield, the rating must be known. There is of course a paucity of exact solutions to nonlinear problems, and so numerical techniques must be used. The authors spend a fair amount of time discussing these techniques in the book, and in formulating the problem of structured pools as one involving (Markovian and non-stationary) stochastic processes.As a warm-up to the complications of asset behavior, the authors first discuss the modeling of liabilities. The collection and distribution of cash to various parties is contained in the \`pooling and servicing agreement' (P&S;), which is a legally binding document that contains a collection of payment instructions called a \`waterfall' or \`structure.' A waterfall codifies the payment prioritization taken from the funds that are available. Examples are given that illustrate their analysis.For those not familiar with Markov chains, the authors give a short review, and argue that they are important to structured finance due to their ability to eliminate long-term static pool data requirements. The Markov chains used in structured finance are finite-state Markov chains, where the states correspond to recognized delinquency states of an issuer in some asset class. The transition matrices of the associated asset pools represent the credit dynamics of structured securities. The authors give three very detailed examples of their formalism, the first one of these, dealing with automobile receivable securitizations, should be familiar to most readers.The last chapter of the book deals with \`triggers', which generalizes the earlier discussion on liability modeling. The authors describe triggers as being the most \`intricate' aspect of the analysis of structured securities. If one views them in terms of their physics analogy as control structures, they are fairly straightforward to understand. \`Cash flow triggers' which allow a reallocation of cash but it does so without being too disruptive or expensive, are the only types considered in this chapter. The cash reallocation is obtained through the use of a \`trigger index', which is usually dependent on transaction variables such as delinquencies or tranche principal balances. A trigger is \`breached' if its trigger index is higher than a pre-selected threshold on any determination date.The authors discuss four basic types of triggers, all of which are defined mathematically in terms of the proportion P(x(t)) of excess spread to be reallocated and some variable function x(t) of the trigger index: \`binary', in which all excess cash is reallocated to the spread account when there is a breach at time t; \`proportional', which allows a kind of \\"ramping up\\" of the triggering; \`differential', where the excess spread is proportional to the first derivative of x(t); and \`integral', where P(x(t)) is proportional to the integral of x(t) over a time interval with lower bound the breaching time and the upper bound the current time. Monte Carlo simulations are used to optimize trigger mechanisms."},{"Title":"The Analysis of Structured Securities: Precise Risk Measurement and Capital Allocation","review":"This intense and well-written book is actually two distinct pieces, appealing to two different audiences. Both are effective, but separate in most cases.The book's aim is said to be (to show) \\"that presented with a capital-efficient, unified analytic approach, the market will find.....the motivation to operate at higher standards of precision, making the prospect of real commodity credit risk management is possible \\" (ref: Preface, (ix)). In Part I, The Contemporary Framework, Part II, Analyzing Structured Securities and Part III, Applications of Numerical Methods to Structured Finance, the authors present a succinct and very readable overview of structured finance, its major elements, risks and analytic tools. In Parts IV and V, Case Studies and Advanced Structural Features, they provide an alternative approach which should permit the desired new \\"credit risk management\\" paradigm.Experienced practitioners will likely skip over the first three parts. To the beginner (like the reviewer), the reading was invaluable. The last two parts are provocative and potentially revolutionary, but require a degree of knowledge and experience which limits their readership to a relatively small group of market practitioners who actually understand the \\"guts\\" of their speciality. It is this dichotomy which leads to the proffered description of the book as being two pieces for different audiences.That having been said, if the reader has the time (or the need) to go from the elementary to the complex, the entire journey of the book can be achieved . In many cases, the authors would help the beginner by including more cases studies or detailed expositions in the appendices and citing references to relevant readings. I took off about six weeks from the book to study the introductory topics in greater detail. And I found there was a sufficient mass of such material that the authors might consider breaking the book into two and expanding the first part into a larger introductory text book. The transition to the second part made me encounter heavier reading and I freely admit to requiring multiple rereads (and not an insignificant number of references to my graduate school quant books). In the end, I did grasp the message the authors intended (I hope).Overall, I feel that of the literally ten thousand plus pages I have read on this subject in the last 6 months, the four hundred odd pages of \\"The Analysis of Structured Securities\\" represent the best investment of my time."},{"Title":"The Analysis of Structured Securities: Precise Risk Measurement and Capital Allocation","review":"As a student of Quantitative Finance, I have to confess I didn't have much idea of what ABS, CDO, CBO, etc stood for. To me, they were just some useful buzzwords one might wish to include in the resume. After reading this book, my understanding of the Structured Finance area improved dramatically.The first two parts of the book provide a thought-through introduction to the inner works of structured securities, along with the methods used to rate them. The way I see it now, a structured security is like a synthetic company. Unlike Microsoft or AT&T;, a synthetic company has no flashy office building or scores of employees. It exists on paper only, but, like a conventional company, it distributes the cash obtained from a certain kind of business to shareholders. For instance, the underlying asset can be receivables from credit card business. Another example is the cash flows obtained from the people who buy cars. As a result of securitization of these cash flows, we get so-called ABS. To benefit from diversification, different types of ABS's can be put together to form a CDO.Therefore, there is no surprise that setting up a structured security properly involves a great deal of legalese. This may be of little interest to a quant, but the authors make it perfectly clear that a single faulty clause in the papers (like using OR instead of AND or vice-versa) can break an otherwise good transaction. Before one can even start some sort of quantitative modeling, one has to have a deep understanding of exactly how various \\"moving parts\\" of the transaction work and what can possibly go wrong.Still, my favorite part is Part III where we get to see how quantitative methods can be helpful. A student taking Linear Algebra who wonders what this stuff is for (as I was many years ago) can find some answers here. The same applies to Markov Chains, Tchebychev Polynomials and even some elements of Number Theory. But again, knowing how structured transactions work from the inside is a must because it provides useful clues during the quantitative part of the process. Part IV illustrates the entire process with a few case studies.Although this book was published in 2003, I don't think it's much outdated. If you are looking for a great and inexpensive introduction, it's the way to go.
