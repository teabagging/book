You can't fault J. Peder Zane, the compiler of this work, but rather the secular, overly-academic types that he solicited the lists from. I mean, what type of person would prefer \\"Bleak House\\" over \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\" over \\"Silas Marner?\\" Another problem with the \\"Top Ten\\" is that they are all books we ought to like, but nobody would read them for pleasure. I would be interested in a similar list garnered from people who really enjoy good literature, but are not trying to impress others with their erudition."},{"Title":"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books","review":"J. Peder Zane compiled 125 lists of top ten greatest books from British and American authors. Each author, from Sherman Alexie to Jennifer Weiner, ranked their 10 masterpieces in order. Each work received 10 points when ranked number 1 and thus 1 point when ranked number 10. The five works which received the greatest number of points are, (1) Anna Karenina, (2) Madame Bovary, (3) War and Peace, (4) Lolita, (5) The adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Madame Bovary actually appeared on more lists (26) than Anna Karenina (25) but Tolstoy's work was ranked higher on its lists 11 more points than Flaubert's.The top five works by living authors are, (1) One Hundred Years of Solitude, (2) To Kill a Mockingbird, (3) Beloved, (4) The Catcher and the Rye and (5) Rabbit Angstrom. And there were a few authors who submitted lists who were fortunate to have their works mentioned on the top ten list of another artist. Michael Cunningham submitted his lists of favorites from Shakespeare's King Lear to the stories of Flannery O'Connor. Anita Shreve, author of The Pilot's Wife, placed Cunningham's The Hours in the number four spot. Stephen King includes Lord of the Flies and 1984 on his list, while David Foster Wallace and Jennifer Weiner both place King's The Stand as their second greatest book.Shakespeare has the greatest number of works on the lists (11), yet Tolstoy collects the most points (327) off of 2 great works. Of the 125 lists there are 544 separate titles, 23 of which appeared as the greatest work on one authors list alone, not making any other list. The range of authors selected to submit top ten lists is varied and diverse including the late Bebe Moore Campbell, Sandra Cisneros, Pearle Cleage, Edwidge Danticat, Arthur Goldin, John Irving, Ha Jin, Sue Monk Kidd, Wally Lamb, Joyce Carol Oats, Ann Patchett and Robert Pinsky. While this survey of fiction does include a small sample of non-fiction and poetry, the central focus is the novel.

I'd argue that the least interesting thing about it is the actual Top Ten. That's not a surprising list, and considering the math used to get there any Top Ten list by any group of people (from a similar pool in terms of nationality and ethnicity) would look pretty similar.What's fun about this is checking out the individual lists by individual authors. I was often surprised by some of the picks, and actually came away from it with a slightly altered opinion about some of the recommenders. I think it's more interesting to start at the bottom end - the books that only got one recommendation - and move forward from there.Interesting. But it's not meant to be definitive. I think everyone involved knew that.

But, for me, the lists are not what make this book so important. It's the 544 titles and the concise synopsis of each which help answer those infernal questions, \\"What should I read? What do I want to read? What am I in the mood to read?\\" Happily, among the inevitable tomes of Proust and George Eliot I found Stephen King, James M. Cain, Gail Parent and others to curl up with on a rainy afternoon. This book definitely should be owned by anyone who reads, wants to read or just wants to appear to read. It is great--buy it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books","review":"It is amusing to look through the lists of individual writers and see their favorite works, and see if they connect with the writer's own kind of writing. Two examples. Norman Mailer had the works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky on the top of his list, and one can see where his ambition to write the Great American Novel came from. Joyce Carol Oates whose love for the dark and the criminal pervades her work puts 'Crime and Punishment' on the top of her list and has a place for Kafka also.So that is one interesting way of reading the work. And this when one might question the list of one- hundred and twenty- five noted authors also. As could be expected there are top writers with one's far lower down on the totempole. And there are many absences. I would have loved to have seen Philip Roth's favorites but he apparently did not respond.As for the top of the top list I was surprised to see 'Anna Karenina' there. If one were to choose Tolstoy as one's greatest novelist one should certainly choose the far greater book 'War and Peace'. ( As I understand it by the way this was meant to be a list of Novels. Otherwise how explain the absence of the 'Book of Books' certainly the greatest book of all times.I also was surprised that 'Don Quixote' was not in the top ten. If the question was asked of Literary Critics my suspicion is it would be the first.In any case there is a lot of room in this work for pleasurable speculation and conjecture.Very good and enjoyable if not taken too seriously."},{"Title":"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books","review":"One of the smartest and well conceived volumes of the decade.

Buy it now and buy another for someone you love."},{"Title":"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books","review":"This is a very interesting book about top ten best books by several dozens of living writers (125 to be exact). According to what they chose, the book presents the number one top ten list with the ten best books, and then the list by every one of the writers. Once in a while there is a very useful and appreciated section called \\"Appreciation of so and so boo,\\" which gives the opportunity to the writer to explain in further detail one of his/her choices. This gives an insight to the reader about the book at hand, so we can decide if that would be a reading we would be interested in. The second part is a very short description of every book that appears on the lists, organized by the times they have been mentioned.The appendixes are: literary number games (by centuries, authors, nationalities, and some genres); index of authors; and index to book descriptions.Not an essential reading, but interesting for those who may be looking to discover new readings. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books","review":"My first question about this book, that I do not believe the editor J. Peder Zane answers anywhere, is how did he select the 125 writers who submitted their favorite books. He only says in his \\"Introduction\\" that these are the responses from 125 leading British and American authors who were asked \\"'to provide a list ranked, in order, of what you consider the ten greatest works of fiction of all time--novels, story collections, plays or poems.'\\" Is this list of 125 \\"leading authors\\" Mr. Zane's list? Did he send a questionnaire out to 200 authors and only 125 bothered to respond while the others tossed him the literary bird and/or threw his request into the garbage without opening it? How did some of these writers make the cut and some of my favorite authors did not? For instance, where are Janette Turner Hospital, Edmund White, Toni Morrison, Colm Toibin, Ian McEwan, Anne Tyler-- just to name six? I would certainly rank them far above many of the writers who made this list, a couple of whom I detest. My second concern is that \\"greatest\\" and \\"favorite\\" are two different kinds of cats. It seems perfectly fine to me to have a favorite book that you do not consider one of the all-time great books. A look at all the books listed, particularly those that just got one vote, proves my point. WATERSHIP DOWN by Richard Adams made one writer's top ten list. Another novel that comes to mind that made nobody's list is Thomas Wolfe's LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL, a book that many of us who grew up at a certain time and place hold dear and might put on a list of favorites but would probably not put on a list of ten great novels. (A friend of mine in graduate school had the temerity to tell one of those older-than-God professors in the English Department that Wolfe was a much better novelist than Faulkner and still passed his orals.)The book, on the other hand, is fascinating. I suspect that I am like most readers. I looked up some of my favorite writers that are included to see what are their favorite books. I therefore checked out Lee Smith, Reynolds Price, Peter Carey, Julius Barnes, John Banville, Allan Gurganus, Russell Banks, Peter Cameron, Annie Proulx. (And to be completely honest, I also checked out those writers I do not like as well.) A couple of choices made my heart sing. Lee Smith's favorite is the novella or long short story \\"THE DEAD\\" by James Joyce. I love that story too. Then Allan Gurganus lists James Agee's A DEATH IN THE FAMILY as his pick for number 5. I have always thought that was a perfect story. I reread it a few years ago and was blown away all over again. Ms. Proulx cut right to the chase with her comment: \\"I find this list of ten books project to be difficult, pointless, and wrong-headed. Just so you'll give it a rest, here is a list. . . Moreover, the lists would change from week to week as one's tastes change and as one reads more widely.\\" Okay! Reynolds Price-- bless his heart-- could never stop being a professor: \\"The several attempts to come up with similar lists at the dawning of our latest millennium only proved the absurdity of such errands. I do feel strongly, however, that there are few other substantial works of fiction from any culture known to me. . .\\" And on and on he goes. I like what dear Peter Carey says best about his list: \\"Here it is---no Joyce or T. S. Eliot or Kafka although they invented the river we swim in. No Bible either, which is impossible. THE GREAT GATSBY is a perfect work of art [that makes many of the lists] and I cut it out. No Faulkner, although I owe him everything. No Chekhov, Munro--what sort of list is that?\\"There are all kinds of lists here in addition to top top ten works: the top ten works by American authors, British authors, French authors, Russian authors, mysteries, science fiction, twentieth century, eighteenth century, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, fifteenth century and earlier as well as essays by various and sundry writers.Of course Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA is the number 1 favorite of all the writers surveyed. George Eliot's MIDDLEMARCH is number 10. I have been meaning to reread ANNA KARENINA in the news translation and just purchased a copy of MIDDLE MARCH, a book I am embarrassed to say I have never read. I have my work cut out for me."},{"Title":"The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books","review":"I browsed through this book a few weeks back during a bookstore visit and put it back on the shelf.

In this case 125 noted and some not so noted writers list the ten best works of fiction as they see it. The results are the accumulation of all of the votes. Of course selecting ten best works is impossible and was so expressed by the selected writers.It is important to appreciate that they are authors and not cataloguers and analyzers of all books written. Their views are obviously subjective and limited by their own reading experiences. For example, several books were selected by various authors as the best works ever but not even mentioned by the other 124.Probably the most interesting aspect of the book is simply to note what books were selected by certain individual writers.Undoubtedly there are better and more informed sources that list the best or most important works of fiction."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"In a departure from her trademark Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane stories, Dorothy L. Sayers presents what is essentially an epistolary novel with this book. Ostensibly a collection of 40-some letters and 2 long written statements, the book details the events leading up to the murder of George Harrison (not *that* George Harrison), and the efforts of the victim's son and a reluctant ally to get to the truth of matter.While it's not exactly Rashomon, unreliable narrators abound, and fixing just what's what as letters contradict each other is the reader's challenge in the first half of the book. In the second half, Paul Harrison details his efforts to find his father's killer and pulls in budding author John Munting to assist him. Their investigation proceeds in fits and starts until it hits the brick wall of knowing *who* committed the murder, and even *why* and *how*, but not being able to prove any of it. As the number of pages dwindles, you begin to doubt if Sayers can get out of the corner she's painted herself into. Without answering whether she does or not, I will say the ending doesn't disappoint.One suspects that Sayers' late-1920's audience got more out of this novel than today's readers. Unless you're well versed in D.H. Lawrence, R.U.R., and other then-current artistic works, you - like me - will miss what I suspect are some rather satirical asides. Nonetheless, this remains a highly enjoyable book by one of England's best mystery writers. (Robert Eustace, Sayers' co-author, is the pseudonym of Dr. Eustace Robert Barton, who likely provided her with much of the scientific material for the story; he also collaborated with several other mystery writers in the first third of the 20th Century.)"},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"Documents in the Case is unlike Sayers' other mysteries. It is in the form, first of all, of documents: letters, newspaper clippings, etc. Secondly, it does not feature Lord Peter Wimsey.It is, however, an intensely interesting book. The characters, with the exception of the femme fatale (who is convincing but entirely unlikable), are portrayed sympathetically and the reader comes away with a sense of the complexity of human nature in general and of the novel's characters specifically. No one is all good or all bad or all anything. The victim--a fussy, middle-class, conservative husband--is drawn with great insight and compassion. Equally so, the murderer, for all the cruelty of the murder, is not unlikable and even pitiable.The main narrator has many of the same personality quirks as Lord Peter Wimsey--a reluctance to get involved, oversensitivity and feelings of self-doubt--but his motives are, I think, more convincing. His quirks are less mannerisms and more part and parcel of his character (as eventually happens with Wimsey). Like all the other characters, he is flawed but comprehensible.In fact, the book is a most unpretentious novel. I enjoy Sayers very much and consider myself a Wimsey fan, but Documents in the Case is, to my mind, a far more realistic and thoughtful mystery than some of Sayers' better known works. The mileau is middle-class. The victim's son (who is collecting the documents) is noble-minded but imperfect: hard to like even when you want him to \\"win\\". And the characters are truly impacted by the murder.The murder itself is interesting enough but much more interesting is the theme that runs alongside the murder: the \\"lop-sidedness\\" of life in general, the idea that living things can never achieve the cookie-cutter perfection of synthetic creations.Recommendation: Give it a try if you are interested in Sayers' work beyond Wimsey (and if you don't mind reading books in letter or document form)."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"I hate to admit it, but I didn't even miss Lord Peter (although I love him). This novel is full of witty and satirically ridiculous characters addressing modern gender, scientific, and philosophical-theological issues in a subtle and fascinating way, ultimately touching on the issue of eugenics that so contributed to the Nazi horror. I especially recommend the audio version, because the reader brilliantly brings to life the vapid Mrs. Harrison and the grouchy novelist Munting, as well as the no-nonsense Victorian Harrison men. One of my favorite Sayers novels so far."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"\\"The Documents in the Case\\" is a departure from Dorothy Sayers' excellent Lord Peter Wimsey series. In the first half (\\"Synthesis\\"), the reader is introduced to the characters (married couple George and Margaret Harrison, roommates Lathom and Munting, and the disturbed Miss Milsom) through a series of letters from and to the characters. The basis for the crime is laid out early in the book, and the murder is solved in the second section (\\"Analysis\\").(This book should be a must-read for organic chemistry students, who will appreciate the solution to the mystery.)Besides furnishing the method of the murder, then-contemporary science plays a huge part in this book, with characters discussing the works of Einstein, Eddington and others. To the modern reader, this seems quaint and rather naive. \\"Glands\\" are discussed multiple times, with the implication that all human behavior would be explained in the near future as a result of \\"heredity and encrocine secretions, economics and aesthetics and so on.\\" Another character comments that \\"Nature's only a rather clumsy kind of chemist . . . rather a careless and inaccurate one.\\" This over-confidence was hardly justifies by future developments--1930s scientists could hardly have predicted the immense complication of the interactions of \\"heredity and endocrine secretions\\", and their effects on human behavior, nor the immense difficulty in organic sythesis, or the DNA revolution.There a couple of real scientific howlers here, notably where one character describes light as a vibration in the aether, a theory that has been completely de-bunked (the \\"lumineferous aether\\" was supposed to be the propagation medium for light). Still, keeping in mind that this book was written in 1930, it's an interesting look into contemporary mindset and theories, and an absorbing mystery."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"I have to admit; when I first read this book I almost put it down a third of the way through. All those letters, diary entries, etc. with nothing to tie them all together. It was boring and irrelevant. Then, after the murder and the first first-person narrative section, the book became fascinating, and I had to go back and re-read the first section carefully for clues and indications. I think this is Ms Sayers best. I have recommended it to many people, even to people who don't usually read mysteries. It is a perfect example of how to pace a plot development. The characters are real and their actions are understandable once you know their motivations, even if you don't like them very much. It is an excellent piece of writing. Read this even if you don't read any other Dorothy Sayers book."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"I hope I am not holding a grudge against The Documents in the Case for not having Lord Peter Wimsey in it. As in many classic mysteries, the jacket reveals the identity of the victim and his cause of death, in this case a wild mushroom enthusiast who dies from consuming deadly Amanita mushrooms. The murder doesn't take place until more than halfway through, leaving plenty of time to set the scene. Perhaps inspired by Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone, the main part of the story is told by letters written by the different characters who are proximate to the murder. Unfortunately all the characters are very self-absorbed and long-winded in a way that I did not find engaging. For social historians, The Documents in the Case highlights 1929 attitudes toward class, feminism, and the new ideas of chemistry, biology, physics, and psychology that were beginning to gain popular currency.Loyal Dorothy Sayers fans who find this less well-known novel after reading her other books will recognize a proto-Miss Climpson and echoes of the feckless \\"artistic\\" set that Harriet Vane ran with before her murder trial.Hard core Sayers fans will get some pleasure from this book even without His Lordship but its main value is as a period piece and exhibit in the history of detective fiction."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"My opinion is that this is a brilliant book. I have been reading a lot (probably a hundred or more) of early English mysteries lately, and one of the reasons I have sought them out and enjoyed them is for the often indirect but interesting glimpses of the life and culture of early last century which appear in them, sometimes more telling in being unintended by the author, and not necessarily part of any conscious attempt to depict the ethos of the era except as it might serve the purposes of the mystery.Of all the \\"golden age\\" mysteries I've read this is certainly the most self-consciously literary and intellectual, full of all sorts of aesthetic, religious, and scientific satire and allusion, a conscious attempt to load a mystery with the paraphernalia of contemporary trends in thought and the arts. Is this the work of a mystery novelist in the \\"literary\\" vein or of a literary novelist in the \\"mystery\\" genre? Both, of course.Some readers miss Wimsey here, but in my opinion this novel holds its own with any of the best and is well worth a read (or two) by anyone who enjoys mysteries or has an interest in English intellectual or art history. Or fungi. The characters, as someone else has noted, are all complex with more or less contradictory natures, and Munting, especially, with his curiosity and indecisiveness, still seems very modern. He is both concerned and detached, and his slightly Wodehousian ditherings keep the proceedings in a lighter mood than you might imagine."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"This book was the first I have read by Dorothy Sayers, and it was very good. There were times when it was a little slow, but other than that, it was very well-written.

I am disappointed in the book because the plot was thin and very predictable."},{"Title":"The Documents in the Case","review":"I didn't think it was possible not to like a Dorothy Sayers mystery...but I didn't like \\"The Documents in the Case\\". The story is presented as a series of letters, newspaper articles and first person writings. As a result, the characters are extremely well drawn and analyzed. But it makes the development of the plot slow and tedious. You're half way through the book before the murder occurs. Then, it's more letters, etc. I had to really work to make myself finish reading the book.An expert on mushrooms, toadstools and other fungi is found dead in his lonely retreat in rural England. There is a question as to whether his death is an accident, a suicide or a murder. Each possibility is pursued in seemingly endless writings. The final resolution is based on a little known, highly technical scientific analysis. It's very intellectual, but not very exciting or compelling.Dorothy Sayers wrote this book together with Robert Eustace. Maybe the combination just didn't work and, as a result, the book didn't work either."},{"Title":"INCOMMENSURABILITY, INCOMPARABILITY, AND PRACTICAL REASON","review":"1. Introduction -- Ruth Chang 2.

It is insightful, practical, easy to read and comprehensive. I got so excited about the book that I was unable to to read it straight through. Instead, I've been hopping through the pages in my typical &quot;N&quot; (iNtuitive)style."},{"Title":"Soultypes: Finding the Spiritual Path That is Right for You","review":"Sandra Hirsh and Jane Kise have co-authored a book entitled \\"Soul Types - Matching Your Personality and Spiritual Path.\\" Both of these ladies write extensively and have a vast array of books to their credit. Hirsh is an expert on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kise specializes in team building and strategic planning.Though this book has many good things to say, unless one has a thorough understanding of the Myers-Briggs Type concepts the book is too difficult to understand completely.There are a number of terms the authors either created just for the purpose of writing this book or redefined to suit their own purposes. This adds to the difficulty in understanding this book.The first key to understanding the book is to understand their definition of spirituality. \\"Here, spirituality refers to aligning our souls with heart, mind and body to fulfill one's purpose, believing that reality includes more than the tangible, and it refers to pursuing a relationship with One greater than ourselves\\" (pages 17-18).The second key to understanding the book is to learn their definition of a new word they created, soulwork. \\"Soulwork means the pursuits and practices that allow for meaning, purpose, and wholeness in life, reaching beyond direct experiences to the unseen around us\\" (page 18).The final key to understanding the book is to grasp their definition of religion. \\"Religion refers to a way of life pursuing soulwork by banding with others who espouse the same beliefs or creeds\\" (page 18). Once the reader comes to understand these three key terms, then the book itself can begin to be digested.As much as I disliked all their terms and definitions, the writers did bring some clarity to my mind about why some people find it more difficult to find spirituality in traditional Christian churches than others. On page 47 they observe that \\"all too often the Intuitive form of spirituality, with its mysticism, mystery, and concentration on the unseen, is held up as the \`right' way to be spiritual.\\" From my personal experience I would agree with this statement. I think it is helpful to realize that those with less intuitive personalities and more sensing personalities discover spirituality in different ways.I appreciated the format of the chapters. It gave the characteristics for that particular personality type and made suggestions of how people with those personalities might enhance their spirituality. It also gave suggestions of what might cause people with that personality type to struggle. Perhaps one of the most helpful sections of each chapter was the part that gave suggestions for how spiritual leaders or friends of that particular personality type could help them grow spiritually.After writing a chapter for each of the 16 personality types, Hirsh and Kise tie it all together in a well written final chapter. They conclude that, \\"In spirituality, traveling down just one path can be the route to stagnation, offering little chance of surprise, challenge, or development\\" (page 241). Though each personality may have a certain way that they naturally approach spiritual issues, they can learn from each other and be inspired from how others seek spirituality and do soulwork. \\"Spiritual wholeness develops . . . when we allow for insights and information from spiritual experiences that are different from our initial, more natural paths\\" (page 241).What I appreciated about the concluding chapter is that they did not try to convince the reader to stop doing what comes natural to them. Instead they ask the read to simply consider how meaningful other paths might be to other people and to consider trying these other types of soulwork on occasion to keep one's own faith fresh. The \\"key to understanding isn't adapting to everyone else - it is understanding the genuine psychological differences, comprehending the spiritual viewpoint of another, [and] gaining knowledge from a changed perspective\\" (page 243). While I may have struggled to understand all the psychological mumble jumble strung throughout the book, this final conclusion made perfect sense to me. This is something I can grasp and put into practice. This is something I can help those around me grasp and put into practice. Therefore, I am glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Soultypes: Finding the Spiritual Path That is Right for You","review":"The concept of the book is interesting, but the book could have been much better. There is only a little bit of information for each type, and the information seems like common sense information. As I read the information for my type, I agreed with the information, but it almost felt like \\"Ok, I knew this already!\\" I didn't really gain any new or valuable information. Since most people don't know their types, it wasn't possible for me to look up anyone elses to try to understand them better.If you don't know about your type already, this might be interesting for you, otherwise this might be just basic information you already know."},{"Title":"Soultypes: Finding the Spiritual Path That is Right for You","review":"As a growing Christian and spiritual director/companion, I highly recommend this book.

In these &quot;songs&quot; from the 1920s and 1930s when he traveled the United States on lecture tour, Paramahansa Yogananda reveals a sweet humility reminiscent of St. Theresa of Lisieux. It may be surprising that a master of yoga disciplines expresses himself in such devotional, personal terms to both his Heavenly Creator and to his earthly charges... but such was his nature. The language is often simple, but occasionally it surprises the reader with striking metaphors and turns of a phrase that belie English as the author's second language.Here are the opening and closing lines from one of my personal favorites; it shows the master's love for his disciples... and the master's love for His Master.&quot;WHEN I AM ONLY A DREAM&quot;I come to tell you all of Him,And the way to encase Him in your bosom,And of the discipline that brings His grace.. . .But when I shall become only a memory, or amental image, or silently speaking voice,When no earthly call will ever revealMy whereabouts in unplumbed space...I will come to remind you that you too are naughtBut a dream of my Heavenly Beloved;And when you know you are a dream,as I know now,We will be ever awake in Him."},{"Title":"Songs of the Soul","review":"My favorite selection is called the Homecoming in which Yogananda describes the solar system and the joy of God in all creation.

In this, his third book, Hurwitz demonstrates his ability to climb inside the psyche of his characters and to create complex, three-dimensional personalities. &quot;Do No Harm&quot; is a compelling, convincing story about a physician's struggle to maintain his compassion and empathy even when faced with the horrific, violent actions of a sadistic maniac.This skillfully told story is rich with surprises and is sure to keep you thinking long after you've returned it to the shelf."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"Dr. David Spier is in charge of the UCLA Medical Center emergency Room and he takes his responsibilities very seriously. When someone sprays lye on the face of one of the nurses standing in the outdoor vestibule, the E.R. is shocked. The victim's brother is a cop who vows revenge on the person who blinded and disfigured his sister. When a second nurse is also victimized, the police conclude that the perpetrator has something against nurses.When the police find and arrest him near the hospital, the perp is covered in lye. The police take him to the emergency room where David treats him and prevents the officers from doing him bodily injury. Fearful that if the police take him out of the hospital he will never arrive at the prison alive, David delays his release and in doing so inadvertently gives him a means to escape. When the perpetrator hurts a third nurse, David vows to track him down and bring him in because he feels guilty that his actions enabled the nasty deed to occur and the woman attacked means a lot to the idealistic doctor.Gregg Andrew Hurwitz is the heir apparent to Robin Cook if this medical thriller is an indicator of the chill level that leaves readers reconsidering any visit to an emergency room. The protagonist is a heroic figure with strong ethics, but is vilified by the press and his peer's for his role in the antagonist's escape. This makes him endearing, empathetic as well as sympathetic to the audience who will hope he triumphs. DO NO HARM is a compelling read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"AT FIRST I WAS NOT SURE IF THIS BOOK WOULD BE ENTERTANING. HURWITZ IS ABLE TO INTERMINGLE TWO VERY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES INTO A NOVEL THAT TURNS OUT TO BE EXCEPTIONAL. IT IS FILLED WITH ACTION AND SUSPENSE.

Intelligently written, well researched, extremely moving. Obviously a great read."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"When I first started the book I thought the idea was interesting, a doctor trying to protecting a patient that had attacked fellow workers, and then the twist with the psych experiments made it even better. The last few chapters just seemed to drag for me, not much to hold my interest."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"This is the first book I have read by Gregg Hurwitz, it will not; however, be my last. I really liked this story from start to finish. There were a few flaws, but hey, that is why there are so many books out there. You can't please all of us all of the time.The story is about an E.R. physician named David who finds himself tangled in a web of madness and destruction after treating a fellow hospital employee who has been attacked by a madman and alkali thrown into her face. This sets off a chain of events and David finds himself and his family more involved than he could ever have imagined.The characters are well developed and I started feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the villian once the story unfolded enough to reveal how he became to be. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but it is well worth your time.The ending left something to be desired, although the impact of the ending is evident if you pay attention to the story. Some of the events in the book were unimportant and never expounded on, leaving you to wonder why they were there, but overall, it was a fun read."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"David Spier is an ER physician at the UCLA Emergency Room. He is on duty when nurses are brought in with severe facial burns due to an attack with lye. It appears a man has targeted nurses for these brutal assaults. When the assailant, named Clyde, is actually apprehended, he is wounded and under David's care. The police want him in custody. However,David hesitates in releasing Clyde because he fears for Clyde's safety. One of the detectives on the case has a sister who was severely injured by Clyde. David wants Clyde brought in under his terms. Unfortunately, Clyde escapes and David is the scapegoat. David feels especially guilty when the attacks continue. He feels personally responsible and wants to do all he can to stop Clyde. This leads to a very dangerous cat and mouse game.Gregg Hurwitz has written a very clever thriller albeit on the lengthy side. David Spier is a man of great principles and it can be quite a bit irritating to see him fear for Clyde's safety which, predictably, leads to his escape. It is an unrealistic character flaw in David and, as such, makes him almost a comic book hero. Other characters are stereotypic. However, the pacing of the plot makes up for any character flaws. The bottom line is the author tells a great story-- perfect for pure entertainment. A truly fun read."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"There wasn't much &quot;action&quot; in the book for supposedley being so scary and heart-pounding. I did enjoy the book, it was well-written in terms of medical terms and psychological issues. The author did a fantastic job at showing us how the bad guy became so psychopathic and heartless. I found the role of the Doctor (David Spier) to be a great character as well, due to the fact that he was straddling the fence between wanting to kill the villain and wanting to help him out of his self-imposed hell. I'm glad I read it, the only downside is I really never got a good sense of fear that the book's cover was hyping."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"I fould the book to be entertaining. However, I thougth the author did not develop Dr. Spier's character in a believable way. In particular, Dr. Spier's actions seemed too outrageous and other than to move the plot along, I just did not understand his motives or circumstances for acting the way he did.Also, having Ed Pinkerton's character just magically accomplish various feats for Dr. Spier seemed a little too convenient. I would have liked to see a more creative development of the plot.Having said that, it was a quick read and the action was entertaining."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"This book has a very interesting premise that could have been done better, it can be fast paced at certain points and drag on at others. Hurwitz is a very average writer. His characters are very vanilla, there is nothing new here."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"See storyline aboveA top-notch thriller with graphic scenes of the emergency room (and Clydes room) with highly descriptive and obviously well researched treatments. It's a story of one doctor's personal ethics. It's a story that packs a lot of suspense with a lot of personal issues. The pace stays fairly strong throughout the story with just an occasional lag.Recommended"},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"This the third of Greg Hurwitz's books I have read and he did not disappoint me in any way.

I really like his books!"},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"Chief E.R. Doctor David Spier is a recently widowed, grieving man, still trying to restart his romantic life in L.A.

Clyde the psychatiatrically imbalanced man responsible for the attacks escapes police custody, due partly to the responsibility of Dr. Spier, and the real hunt has begun.Hurwitz( this is my first novel I've read by him) is an extremely accomplished author. I admit I was almost daunted in the early pages when he graphically descibes medical proceedures in a buey E.R. However he toned down the jargon in later chapters and instead painted vivid characterizations of both antangonist and protangonist. His novel is also intelectually stimulating as well as imgaginatively stimulating, due to some key issues that arise from his plot such as how adherant to hippocratic oath doctors should be, and revenge versus justice.

Here we have a tender-hearted ER doc going head to head with a vengeful maverick street cop. They tangle over what to do about the psychopath who is attacking hospital personnel. Does his troubled past excuse his current behavior?The book is a page turner - perhaps a little tighter editing would have made for a neater read - but a great beach book."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"Greg Andrew Hurwitz's new book, \\"Do No Harm\\" deals with a troubled individual who wreaks havoc in the UCLA Medical Center by throwing lye in the faces of two nurses. One nurse is blinded and horribly disfigured for life, and her brother, a police officer, wants to kill the perpetrator when he is caught and hospitalized. David Spier, chief of the Emergency Room, is a compassionate doctor, and he prevents the police from carrying out their brand of vigilante justice. Unfortunately, the felon, whose name is Clyde, escapes and he continues to spread mayhem and threaten those whom he perceives as his enemies.There are aspects of \\"Do No Harm\\" that are very strong. Hurwitz does a wonderful job of developing character. He makes the criminal in this book so vivid that the reader feels as if he has met this individual, a truly horrifying prospect. The author also effectively explores some of the ethical dilemmas that confront doctors. How far should physicians go to protect the patients in their care? Does a person's psychiatric history excuse him when he turns violent?Because Clyde escaped while under David's care, the police and his colleagues in the hospital ostracize the doctor. Therefore, partially to redeem himself and to assuage his guilt, David decides to track down Clyde by himself. David is helped by a shady character who is an expert at private investigations that are not sanctioned by law. David eventually finds out that Clyde's behavior has roots that go back many years, and the doctor uses his medical knowledge to diagnose what is troubling Clyde now. Some of his findings are extremely shocking, and David finds himself questioning many of the assumptions that he has held all of his life.David is also still mourning his beloved wife who died several years ago, and he is slowly getting involved with a young doctor who reciprocates his feelings. However, David's problems in the ER, and his lingering feelings for his wife, interfere with his ability to commit himself to a new relationship.There are two obvious weaknesses in \\"Do No Harm.\\" First, it is difficult to believe that a man as mentally unbalanced as Clyde would be capable of carrying out so many carefully planned and even sophisticated attacks. Second, the last quarter of the book is overly long and repetitious.Overall, however, \\"Do No Harm\\" is an engrossing novel, with authentic medical details, an extremely exciting plot and an attractive, albeit somewhat flawed, hero. Those who love medical and psychological thrillers will find \\"Do No Harm\\" both fascinating and suspenseful."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"This book has an interesting premise. There is a serial alkali thrower terrorizing nurses and doctors at a hospital. Of course, the mixed up fellow has motives for what and why he is doing this.The plot meanders on for a while and then takes a number of unexpected twists and turns. It is rather odd that the main character who is so good at figuring out some things can seem to be so brain dead when it comes to basic don't go down that blind alley.Finally, the ending did not have the kind of bang you'd expect from this kind of book."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"David Spier is the Chief of the ER at UCLA Hospital. Amidst the typical chaos, a nurse is brought in from outside the ER doors in horrible pain suffering from extreme burns to the eyes, face, mouth, and throat. Some sort of corrosive liquid has been thrown in her face. David finds himself treating her and dealing with her upset and concerned brother, a LAPD officer. David and Officer Jenkins get off on the wrong foot which does not bode well considering both take a personal interest in solving the case and finding the attacker. But the attacker turns out to be extremely unstable and unpredictable. The police believe David is meddling in their investigation while he believes that he has the medical insight to find the suspect in ways that the police are unable. But when David becomes the primary target he must work in concert with the police or they both risk letting the bad guy escape and do more harm to other innocent victims.This is the third novel by Hurwitz and they have steadily declined. This plot had great potential and simply fell flat. Much of David's personal grief behind the scenes of the main plot distracted and significantly slowed down the pace of the story. Further, David was not particularly sympathetic and created more trouble for himself than necessary. Instead of rooting for him to find the bad guy, the reader wants to scream at him in frustration. The pages start turning and then abruptly stop. Then the pace picks up again only to hit the skids once more. By the last third you will just be reading to finish, not because the story is providing any enjoyment. Unfortunately, this novel was a large disappointment."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"Such babbling nonsense. After the first couple of chapters the book becomes an unrealistic and inane read.

This is the second work I've read by author Hurwitz and I look forward to enjoying his other titles."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"Gregg Hurwitz is one of my favorite authors and this book is a book that you can't put down. There are always twists and turns that are totally unexpected and you wont be disappointed in Do No Harm."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"This is not an earth-shattering balls-to-the-walls thriller. This is a well written and plotted book that tends to get caught-up in it's concern for the rights of the accused. At what point does a mentally disturbed (or confused) person who consciously sets-out to hurt people lose their 'right' to our sympathy and the protection of the mental health laws.Dr.Spier is the typical liberal minded person who went into medicine because he wanted to help people who were suffering. Though he could have went into any field of medicine, he chose 'Emergency/Trauma' because it gave him the chance to help those who had an immediacy of need without having to make moral judgments. Someone comes into the ER with a 'rebar' in their chest, you don't ask them their opinion of abortion or euthanasia, you work on saving their life and worry about their personal opinions later.Most of this book is really a treatise on how people react to people, based on the way they act and look. The 'perp' is about as unappealing as possible and little changes to make him any more palatable. But Hurwitz tends to get preachy at times and you can see his heart on his sleeve in the little side stories (like the cop who takes his motherless children to the park next to the police shooting range for a birthday party).It's a good book but Hurwitz is trying to do too many things at once and keeps losing his way. Is it a thriller, police procedural, love story or what; and is it about a 'boy scout' getting hurt by discovering the real world outside.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"The book caught me on the first page. I enjoyed the plotline, the characters and all the twists and turns in the book. From the twisted brain of Clyde to the self-doubting Dr. Spier, it was all a great read. While there were some bits in the story that were maybe not so plausible (does drain eze really work that fast and that bad - I don't know), the whole package lead me into it hook, line and sinker.I didn't find myself lying awake at night in fear, but I did spend many a late night, flipping pages wondering what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Do No Harm","review":"This is another medical thriller that's got more plausibility than most. It calls some attention to the nature vs. nurture debate as far as the development of sociopaths. The characters were believable and the setting was presented well.

So far this book has helped in both cases. I also use energy (Reiki-Do) and others energies, but that's another story. It all works together so far. My dog is getting elderly though, so don't know how much longer we have, but this book has helped to make her life much better WITHOUT harmful drugs (my other dog had the drugs and lasted only 11 months).

It is a very informative book and it can help you understand what your vet is trying to accomplish. The book is well illustrated and shows you the points for acupuncture. Chinese medicine is based on the natural elements. The Chinese saw similarities between natural elements and the body. The body is divided into Meridians . One of the meridians is called the Triple Heater. It describes temperature regulation in the body. Each meridian has a time that is performs at its bestAlong with the Five Elements and Meridians, there is a system of Ying and Yang and the rest of the eight principles. The eight principles are based upon qualitity,quantity, and location of a problem. In addition the external environment is taken into account. The book talks about Jing Essence, which is similar to DNA in western medicine The spirit is part of the healing process. There is a chapter on herbs .Chinese medicine is known as TCM. It can sometimes denote a pattern of imbalance that would not show up in a Western type health clinic TCM restores balance to the body. It does not suppress or kill parts of the body. It is a gentle healing process and the Whole is taken into account.Another chapter discusses food and how the food can aid in healing. Temperature, flavors,ying and yang, and methods of mixing all have a part in the healing process Foods mimic the Season.

In the following chapters, Dr. Schwartz introduces the primary holistic therapies used in TCM: Herbology, Food Therapy, and Acupressure/Acupuncture (emphasis is on acupressure and this chapter is illustrated with color photos of dogs and cats depicting the meridians as well as acupressure points).In section three the information from sections one and two is applied to correct a variety of health imbalances. Dr. Schwartz recommends herbs (Chinese &amp; Western), dietary modifications, nutritional supplements, and acupressure points for health conditions/imbalances involving the eyes, ears, nose and upper respiratory system, teeth and gums, lungs, heart, liver and gall bladder, spleen/pancreas and stomach, kidneys and urinary bladder, large intestine, bones and muscle, skin, and the immune system and glands. It's wonderful to see a book on natural remedies that focuses on correcting the underlying imbalance instead of simply using herbs and supplements to eliminate symptoms. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"I have very little knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine and have appreciated Dr. Schwatz's ability to help me better grasp this approach to acupressure, acupuncture, herbs, diet and other TCM treatment for animals. I borrowed this book from a friend &amp; find it so valuable that I want a copy for myself. Each time I read a chapter or refer to a graphic showing acupressure points or meridians I feel more familiar with this ancient &amp; venerable art &amp; science. I am a practicing licensed veterinary technician and work in a clinic that will soon offer traditional Chinese veterinary medicine as well as Western veterinary medicine. This book is an excellent tool to help me as a veterinary professional peel open my mind, senses and vision and expand my ability to assist vets in this new dimension. It's well worth every penny. Any ainmal lover will use it for years. Thanks for letting me share my opinion."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"As a veterinarian who is becoming open to and familiar with alternative health care, I highly recommend Cheryl Schwarz's book to everyone, professionals as well as pet owners. It gives a well rounded easy to read overview of Chinese medicine basics as they apply to small animals including 5-Element and 8-Principle theory. Cheryl gives comprehensive accupressure basics and guidelines. In the second half of the book she discusses individual pet health problems in terms of Eastern Medicine and makes accupressure, herbal and dietary recommendations based on her wealth of knowledge. I have one copy at the office, one at home, I bought each of my other vets a copy and I've already had 5 clients buy it! A GREAT resource book for beginners AND experienced practitioners."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"As a long time practioner of TCM or Traditional Chinese Medicine I believe this to be one of the three must-haves. Schwartz introduces and elaborates on TCM thoroughly and concisely. It is a wonderfully informatve book for someone new to TCM or a practioner. When owned, one will find themselves referencing it again and again. The text and charts are easily navigated. It will open ones eyes about the roots and practical applications of TCM. Readers will wish they owned a guide just like it for humans. Schwartz has compiled all of the information it would take the average person months to research, all the while painting a clear picture of the procedures and their benefits. Well written, pleasant read. Once again, a must own."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"Good book both for people looking to understand alternative treatments and also for students studying TCM/acupressure for companion animals. Four Paws Five Directions clearly explains both the theory and practical application of TCM tailored to animal care. It lays out the fundamentals of TCM and provides many examples to help illustrate the key points. The second part of the book goes into the specifics for common ailments from a TCM perspective and guides you through herbal/acupressure/nutritional treatments. I've successfully tried a couple of the recommended acupressure treatments and found them effective."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"If you believe in herbs, chinese medicine, acupuncture, and acupressure you will love this book.

While asking my UC Davis vet about it she is unable to answer or refer to anyone in the field of LaC and DVM. There may be no more than a few wanting to become one in west coast.I find the book quite clear. The author grasped the concept of 5 elements, governing vessel without going into too much theoretical and classical theories which can confuse even the medical professional. Her description of herbs are quite valuable and can be used to treat animals. Not sure how to get fluffy to drink decoction but it can be tricked with fish emulsion? This is an excellent book on animals and treatment of disease."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"I felt the need to only give this book three stars to alert buyers about a major shortcoming of this book since there is no \\"look inside this book\\" feature on this text.This book is overflowing with useful information about canine health from the point of view of Traditional Chinese Medicine which is presented clearly. This includes dietary advice for different health conditions and even behavioral signs that might indicate future illness; hyperactivity and barking in dogs that later develop heart issues, for example. However, there is one notable problem in putting that information to work acupressure-wise: The illustrations in the book are not very good regarding helping you locate acupoints. There are anatomical descriptions that vary in how useful they are in the text, but the acupressure \\"charts\\" are glossy photos of living cats and dogs with a wide squiggle line drawn to indicate meridians (see cover of book). There are also pictures to show point constellations for various ailments. Again, these are little dots on glossy photos of living animals. You cannot see the bones to accurately know where on differing animals these points actually are. Also, the photos vary from dog to cat, so if you are only treating a dog, for instance, and your pet's ailment is illustrated on a cat, this can be frustrating--there are differences! So, unless you are experienced with point finding, you will probably find yourself wanting a canine or feline acuchart. \\"The Well-Connected Dog: A Guide to Canine Acupressure\\" has much better point-finding charting which you can check out through the \\"Look Inside\\" feature.

I started implementing some of the dietary recommendations that fit him....started getting results...and then decided to go the complete route: diet, herbs and accupuncture. Fortunately, I was able to go directly to Dr. Schwartz for acupuncture. To put this into perspective, I had spent the previous three years working with several very high quality canine dermatology specialists on what seemed to be intractable full body skin problems, ear infections and eye infections. Most recently, despite daily antibiotics, daily topical medications, weekly injections, antibacterial and antifungal bathing, one ear had gone into hyperplastic growth and required a multi-thousand dollar ablation procedure. Nothing was working. The dog was miserable. I was miserable. On several occasions, as I visited surgeons and doctors' offices, I would hear about other dogs from the same breeder coming in for surgery and other treatment. Clearly, genetic flaws in the line were the issue, others were having problems, and the vets - high quality as they were - weren't generating solutions for any of us.This book turned everything around. Everything. The diagnosis identified a combination of diet, Chinese herbs and acupuncture. Given that his genetic problems weren't going to go away, for the rest of his long doggie life, he stayed on the appropriate diet and herb combination. After an initial period where we did acupuncture once a month, maintenance acupuncture dropped to four times a year. This simple routine kept all the medical problems at bay. All the rest of the stuff - the antibiotics, surgery, injections - gone. The empirical evidence of success was very clear.I bought \\"Four Paws\\" on the recommendation of a friend who had successfully dealt with some tough medical problems with her dog via this route. It more than worked for me. Of course, I had the advantage of being able to work with Dr. Schwartz directly - but the information is right there in the book. Don't overlook the recommendations on diet and herbal supplements in addition to acupressure or acupuncture. As part of a general routine, as a complement to conventional medical care, and particularly for problems where conventional medicine isn't giving you traction, this book's information could make an immense difference for you and your pet. It's so fortunate that Dr. Schwartz wrote this book, and I am glad that it was recommended to me. If there was a way to give it more than five stars, I'd do it."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"One of the best books I have ever read on both energy therapy and practical application for animals."},{"Title":"Four Paws, Five Directions: A Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs","review":"It is a simple and easy book of understanding, of the way that the students, in his course beginning, need to understand the Chinese medicine. But for a professional acupunturist he also has his usefulness, because that the part 3 on treatment serves more commonly as a fast guide of treatment for the diseases found. Its serves as a book of incomes. In spite of knowing that the Chinese medicine seeks the treatment of the patient and not of the disease in itself, trying to balance the patient, nevertheless, as a first treatment this book aids the professional to give the first steps.

The Annie strips originally appeared on the basis of one per day (with a four-strip &quot;special&quot; on Sundays. The storyline in this book links tightly with the calendar - with Page 1 having Annie on January 1 1933 looking back over 1932. During the course of the year she gets involved in four adventures in which she consistently demonstates her approach to life (work hard, fight your own battles, help others down on their luck to get back up). The stories are overtly political - apparently decent pillars of society turn out to be crooks, con men turn out to have more natural decency. When a farmer cheats Annie out of her wages, a lightning bolt burns down his barn. Two women intent on putting Annie into an orphanage are described as busy bodies. In the end Daddy Warbucks returns to the US on Christmas Eve - just in time to save Annie from her latest troubles. They both wish the readers a Merry Christmas. On New Years' Eve they review the year ending, and wish everyone a happy 1934.The graphical work is excellent. The adventures are more complex than you'd expect from a daily strip. Seeing the daily strips laid out alongside each other, one can see how cleverly the author keeps restating major story items so that anyone who missed a day's paper doesn't lose the plot."},{"Title":"Little Orphan Annie, Vol. 3","review":"I bought all three books available; Annie for 1933, '34, and '35.

Suddenly the quiet Canadian town of Chester has more crime than it bargained for. Roger Shepperd, Christian and Royal Canadian Mounty, has more crime than he can deal with at once. As he works night and day on the cases and neglects his family, he begins to question his earlier decision to take a promotion and move the family to a new town. What is God's plan for Roger? Also, how can he solve the perplexing murder that threatens to give all of Christianity a bad name? And how, if at all, are these baffling mysteries related? Once again, Hall pens a complicated plot full of surprises that will keep you reading! This is a great story for all mystery fans, secular and Christian alike."},{"Title":"November Veil (RCMP Series #2)","review":"The upside: It's nice to see Mounties portrayed in fiction as something other than romantic leads in the backwoods of Canada, or as overly quaint lawmen who might be a bit clueless. If only because it's an amazing Force and covers so much more ground than most people outside of Canada realize. The story itself was a quick read, the writing was competent, the various ties between crimes improbable, but interesting.The downside: Pretty much every non-Christian being portrayed as a slob, a cynic or half competent. Heavy handed on the message. Unrealistic in the dialogue between cops; only in a Pollyanna world do cops pretend to be shepherds or angels. I know this is marketed as Christian fiction, but after the fourth or fifth time it's pointed out in the text, it becomes painful. And this is speaking from a Christian perspective -- the author seemed to feel the need to not only show, but repeatedly TELL, and it got old quickly. I think the story would have better been served by more realistic dialogue, more genuine looks into police work, and showing the protagonist more as a cop than a preacher. The resolution was predictable, and perhaps a little cliche.Overall, it's a good book to read if you're looking for something light and fluffy, and are willing to overlook the heavy handedness or unreality. If you're looking for a hard-hitting crime drama, or something more subtle, you won't find it."},{"Title":"Vitamin Book","review":"This is by far the best vitamin book on the market today.

For example, the table on vitamin C lists over 70 food sources for the vitamin, and gives the amounts (in mg / 100 gr food) of the vitamin in each source. The book brings the same type of table for each and every nutrient. These tables are excellent references as they list almost every food source for almost every nutrient.

As well, he devotes a chapter to the pre-Platonic inception and transformation of the term. His thesis, even 7 years later, is quite radical as it challenges much of the predominant and conventional ways of understanding Plato as a philosopher seeking a science of moral knowledge. He engages with such promiment scholars as Marthat Nussbaum and T. Irwin. Roochnik's book is a significant contribution to the recent attempt to re-appreciate a philosopher so often seen to be a footnote to modern thinking. Finally, anyone interested in the question of technology will find this study worthwhile and very illuminating of the difference between its ancient form and the current understanding."},{"Title":"Of Art and Wisdom: Plato's Understanding of Techne","review":"If Roochnik's thesis is correct, great injustice has been done to Plato. You would think, after 2,500 years we would have this right, but, unfortunately Roochnik thinks we are teaching Plato all wrong. Roochnik does battle with a thing he calls the SAT (standard application of techne) which is a scholarly consensus that Plato had an art (techne) of virtue and it was teachable. The problem with this thesis is, as Dr. Roochnik points out, that it makes Plato a Sophist and not a philosopher. This is a welcome exercise in philosophical and interpretive hubris. It has a quality that Kierkegaard called angst, a sympathetic antipathy. One can imagine scholars attracted to the book for it's lively and fascinating discussion of pre-socratic techne, at the same time, put off by the thesis that everyday the world over paid professional academics are misrepresenting the thought of one of the foundational figures of western culture. Can you not imagine such a one holding his nose as he footnotes a reference? It is to laugh!"},{"Title":"Of Art and Wisdom: Plato's Understanding of Techne","review":"Roochnik's 20 years of study has revealed a clear but shallow book on Plato; he forges his &quot;techne&quot; glasses on everything he touches leaving the reader with no clear understanding of what Socratic wisdom consists of. His Plato becomes boring and uninsightful. Readers should skip this book and go directly to Strauss or Bloom for a clear and meaningful understanding of PLatonic wisdom."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gospel of Matthew (SkyLight Illuminations)","review":"I love books on religon.

In this edition he tells the story of the evolution of Christianity, not simply in dates and places, but rather as the experience of Jesus Christ has been understood and handed on through the centuries. Every author has a perspective, a point of view, and John Dwyer views the Church not simply as an institution, although it is clearly that, but more as the instrument for passing on the faith from one generation to the next. Present in this very human enterprise is the presence of the Holy Spirit, but the clarity with which Dwyer traces the evolution of doctrine makes this work extremely valuable for the lay reader. I provide this book as required reading for my classes in Church History."},{"Title":"Church History Revised","review":"I studied under John Dwyer most of my undergraduate and MA work. This included 4 or 5 courses in Church history (different eras) while John was writing this book. At no time did I have the least sense he was bitter towards the Church. He loves it deeply and (more) the reality it mediates in its sacraments and Scriptures. However, he is not pollyanna-ish about it either. This particular book is a survey of Church history written for the adult lay person and meant to be supplemented with secondary sources. It is particularly appropriate for college or graduate students working their way through a course or two in Church history or for a parish series on Church history. It is not meant to rival or replace Bokenkotter. It serves a different purpose and is also more accessible for many, however.What comes through clearly in every chapter of this work is the constant dynamic of reform empowered by the Spirit's movement through the Church at all ages, sometimes via the agency of monasticism, sometimes through councils, and often through individuals as God summons people to become his own \\"Called ones\\" (ecclesia) in response to and proclamation of the Gospel. But to be clear about reform and the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Church, one also needs to be honest when the all-too-human elements embodied in the Church gain ascendency. Those who find bitterness here probably ought to check for their own hidden assumptions and projection. After all, to truly love the Church, just as to love anything or anyone at all, is not to whitewash or idealize them. As Dwyer says himself, honesty \\"will not lead to contempt but to a deeper (because more realistic) love.\\""},{"Title":"Church History Revised","review":"All throughout the book, Mr. Dwyer betrays his own prejudices and sourness toward the Catholic Church. His Jesuit training comes through, which is not all bad, but at times gets in the way of objectivity. No Saint is given that title, nor is any pope titled Pope. Are you Catholic, or not, Mr. Dwyer? If you have a chip on your soulder about the church, write about that, but not church history. Also, you misrepresent western monasticism and Saint Benedict, either purposely, or through neglect. Likewise, you misrepresent St. Therese of Lisieux, comparing her with Luther. Are you unaware of her devotion to the Blessed Mother? Mostly, the book is on the politics of the papacy, with a sprinkling of other developments in church history. You don't seem to be outright anti-Catholic, but obviously infected with a lot of negativity, which, unfortunately, overshadows what truth you would present."},{"Title":"Church History Revised","review":"This book could be a valuable addition to the student's library if it wasn't for the obvious editorializing which punctuates the chapters and betrays the author's anti-Catholic bias.A much better source for serious study is the more scholarly work: \\"A Concise History of the Catholic Church\\" by Thomas Bokenkotter."},{"Title":"Bravehearts and Memories: Two Novellas","review":"How true it is that you should never judge a book by looking at the cover.Fortunately as an admirer of Chris Kent's books I ignored the cover and got straight into the novella and the memoirs.What amazes me is Kent's ability to move from genre to genre. Bravehearts is incredibly authentic as an example of the Edwardian boys' adventure story but it is infused with a 21st century sensibility, not say frankness, that doesn't jar at all. For me, Bravehearts is far too short; there are lots of scenes that could have been developed in greater detail... not, of course, the erotic scenes where Kent is as explicit and detailed as ever.Frankly, I used to find the erotic and graphic detail off-putting but I've realised there's a serious purpose in it: to accept and acknowledge that boys having sex together is erotic, is graphic, is challenging, amusing, awkward and entertaining as much as it is for any couple or any group or combination.Bravehearts has a story to tell. The graphic stuff simply adds to the power of the tale.The 'Memoirs' is something else. It has that authentic, biographic ring that makes it feel as if this is a real person going through these experiences; and my God, they are SOME experiences.While reading, I had a thought... would the books and movies that deal with boy-boy love/lust and man-boy love/lust be possible without the emergence of Chris Kent a few years ago?He is the first author I know who seems to say \\"Stuff political correctness; this is the way it actually is for some boys.\\"At the same time he manages to combine a high seriousness, even profundity, with some frankly silly or dream-like episodes. But they rarely jar; they are simply 'Chris Kent'.CheersJon Kent(no relationship, incestuous or otherwise!)"},{"Title":"Fun Facts About Dogs: Inspiring Tales, Amazing Feats, Helpful Hints","review":"I'm a dog lover so when I saw the title, &quot;Fun Facts About Dogs&quot;, by Richard Torregrossa I knew I had to read the book. I needed something fun and light to read and this book did the trick.Fun Facts, sheds an informative light on why dogs behave the way they do. Do you ever wonder why dogs eat their food so fast? Why poodles love to be bathed and groomed? Or even why dogs howl? This book will answer all of these questions and a lot more.From as far back as I can remember all the dogs I have owned have gobbled down their food in record speed and always begged for yours if you ate in front of them. According to Torregrossa's book, when dogs were wild (before they became domesticated), food was gobbled down in a hurry because wild dogs, did not know when their next meal would arrive; and worst yet, the food could be stolen by rivals such as the hyena. It's a &quot;habit which was left over from the wild&quot;.I guess it's pretty safe to say enjoying a bath is not a habit left over from the wild. When I was a little girl, my older sister Shirley, had a poodle who loved to take a bath. His name was &quot;Shalong&quot;. Amazed at how he would just sit there in a tub of water, I often wondered why he enjoyed the bath. Other dogs would scramble to get out of the water.Well it turns out, poodles were originally bred in England, &quot;to hunt ducks and geese in muddy swaps&quot;. That would make them use to the water. I'm guessing all that getting muddy, smelly and dirty was even too much for a dog so when it came time to get cleaned up the dog couldn't wait.Another habit left over from the wild is the &quot;howl&quot;. In the wild the howl was used for dogs to gather together in the pack so they could &quot;face impending danger together&quot;. Today if your dog howls he's lonely. Could he be alerting the &quot;pack&quot; for company?Torregrossa's book, in paperback, includes over 70 known facts about loveable pooches. Each fact/story (most running no more than two pages) is illustrated with humorous black and white drawings of man's best friend.A perfect commute read, the book can easily be read under an hour. It's a perfect gift for dog lovers or just anyone who wants to learn more about dogs.There's even a sprinkling of real life stories which show why dogs are so loyal. For example, there's a story about a dog (this incident took place over 100 years ago in England) whose owner died. Everyday for the next 15 years the dog faithfully sat by the owner's grave. Wow! Talk about missing someone."},{"Title":"Fun Facts About Dogs: Inspiring Tales, Amazing Feats, Helpful Hints","review":"Lots of dog and cat books are on the selves these days, but Fun Facts About Dogs is really different.

I swear Richard was checking out my mutt when he plotted out of the activities and the happy grins. Of course, my dog doesn't know about slowing his eating, even though he's not part of a pack, and there's no competition for his food. Our cat couldn't care less about our dog, yet our little canine always wants to play with the feline, but she doesn't even bother hissing at him - just walks away, apparently in disgust at the immaturity of our little friend.

And so that's the war we learned about from our radios and our visits to movie theaters ... oh, and in addition to Movietone news we also got a steady stream of WWII movies. (My friends and I went to see every one, I believe. And we also read all the popular books about battles that were written during and after the war.)Among the war books I read later in life was the memorable account of the Battle of Stalingrad, where Hitler's armies first were soundly defeated ... by the Russian winter and the Soviet forces. The author of \\"Stalingrad\\" is Antony Beevor. It is British writer Beevor and his Latvian collaborator, Luba Vinogradova, whom we have to thank for the excellent editing, annotating and translating of \\"A Writer at War.\\"The writer in the title was Vasily Grossman, born in the Ukraine in 1905, trained as a scientist at the University of Moscow, but then making his living as a published writer of fiction prior to the Nazi invasion of the USSR in June of 1941. After being rejected as a volunteer for the Red Army, Grossman applied, and was accepted, as a war correspondent for the Red Army's newspaper, \\"Krasnaya Zvezda\\" (\\"Red Star\\"). Grossman's book, which was published in 2005, is a collection of reports that appeared in that newspaper, as well as pieces that had been deemed by the Soviet commissars as too honest/controversial for the newspaper, as well as writings from his notebooks and from letters to family and friends.The compilation of these extensive samples from Grossman's writings provide the reader a first-hand account of most of the major battles between German and Russian forces from the steppes of central Asia to the fall of Berlin.But the book is much more than an account of battles. It's an account of a country at war. Moreover, it's an account of a huge swath of landscape - Russian, Ukrainian, Polish and German - torn up by tank treads and truck tires and soldier's boots, soaked in blood from both the population and the combatants. (On the Soviet side the combatants included Ukrainian, Siberian and Polish troops and partisans; the Nazis had Italian, Romanian and Ukrainian allies and partisans.)The writing is straightforward, and the horrors of war between desperate adversaries is not sugar coated. Grossman spent more time with the troops than any of the other army journalists and was trusted by the officers and the enlisted men. The death of combatants, prisoners, and civilians is reported. The destruction of cities and the pillaging of villages is reported. Suicides by those who saw no purpose in continuing to live is reported.The most difficult sections to read are the sections relating to the round-up of Jewish populations - mostly in Ukraine and Poland - and the subsequent killing of most of those who had been rounded up. Although these reports were not permitted to be published in the Army newspaper, they were later published in other venues, and Grossman was invited to testify at the Nuremberg trials as to what he had seen and learned. He did go and bear witness to the atrocities, which ... as I said ... are not easy to read.Grossman was apparently unique among Russian war correspondents. He was an avid socialist, but he wasn't a communist party member, nor was he an apologist for Stalinism with its gulags and purges and killings. He did not try to please the authorities with his reports from the front. Nevertheless, Stalin was aware of his writing and wanted him to continue to be published because his reports were often more honest than the reports he was getting from his generals.In addition to his war reporting, Grossman published a number of novels and plays. The works translated into English thus far are this book about the war, \\"Forever Flowing\\" (a fictionalized account of life in Stalinist Russia and not published until 1970, after Stalin was dead), and \\"Life and Fate,\\" which could not be published until 1980. This book, which has been compared to \\"War and Peace\\" in its scope and in its variety of clearly drawn characters, fictionalizes the life and times of Grossman and his colleagues and friends and family during the war years. There are no journalists in this fictionalized biography. Aside from the military men, the other main characters are scientists and wives of scientists. Grossman got his degree from the University of Moscow in the sciences.I had read \\"Life and Fate\\" prior to reading \\"A Writer at War.\\" I would suggest that anyone wanting to sample Grossman start with the latter book, since it's a more immediate account of what he and his colleagues - and especially the country and the population - lived through during the war years."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Most casual students of World War II in Europe are familiar with the major battles in the West, and are probably conversant with the Eastern struggles at Leningrad and Stalingrad, but that's about it as far as the \\"Russian Front\\" goes. This gripping book tells us the Russian soldier's story \\"from the grunt's eye-view\\", and we learn a lot about how the typical Russian soldier felt about the war. In an Ernie Pyle-style of writing, the author delves into the smallest aspect of the soldiers' lives, and their reaction to the fighting. As a conclusion, the reader learns that these soldiers fought, not for Communism or Stalin, but for the liberation of their Motherland, and for their friends who fought beside them. It's a powerful work, and one that really deserves wide distribution."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"This book is one that tells it like it is. The Stalingrad part was the best. But it all was good. The stories are so raw and untouched. Every once in a while Vasily's notes are contradicted in some small way, but the author makes sure to explain it if need be. Wow. Also a mythbuster. Talks about the \\"Major Koening\\" and \\"Berlin Sniper School\\" problems. If you are fairly brand new to Stalingrad and the Russian front (which you probably aren't if you are reading this book), then I'd read up on the Russian front first to get more enjoyment out of this book."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Vassily Grossman was the greatest of the Soviet Union's war correspondents during the Second World War. Unlike other reporters who tended to guild the lily to paint a pretty picture of the Red Army and Soviet Society, Grossman tried to get as close to the truth as Stalin's censors would let him. The power of his writing and the support he received from soldiers who loved his accurate accounts of the war, kept him on the front pages of the Red Army paper _Red Star__ throughout the war. Here we get the story of his war, told by his great writing, pieced together with narration of his life and the war.I call particular attention to Grossman's \\"The Hell of Treblinka\\" which is printed almost in full in this book. This is one of the greatest pieces of writing of any kind that I have ever read. It is worth much more than the price of this book just to read this one piece. This is the world's first complete look at a Nazi death camp, told by a skilled writer whose mother had been murdered by the Nazis.One of the greatest experiences in human history was the Soviet War with Nazi Germany and its Italian, Roumanian, Finnish, and Hungarian allies. In that struggle tens of millions of people were killed, the USSR's most developed and agriculturally productive regions were laid to waste, and millions of Jews, Communists, Gypsies, and other victims of the Nazi murder machine were sent to death camps. In the USSR itself, a relentless campaign of suspicion and persecution met many of the frontline fighters against Hitler, against the real partisans, and against nationalities that Stalin deemed too sympathetic to Hitler.Yet, for the most part, people in the West have been shielded from the truth of this struggle with the fairy tale story how the Nazis were defeated by the Normandy invasion. Similarly, the Stalinist propoganda of the \\"heroic\\" perfect Red Army provides the only other well-known view.This book is largely made up of Grossman's articles about the war, his letters to friends and relatives about the war, and his diaries. Beevor, a really good writer in his own right, just supplies enough explanation to knit together Grossman's words and maike them understandable to the reader. Grossman was dedicated to telling the truth about the war, a truth that included the bungling and corruption of the Soviet Officers, the horror of the war, the deaths and the woundings of the war.We see pictures of the battles from the first days to the entry in Berlin, written not as hero worship or propoganda, but written with an accuracy Grossman demanded because his chief audience was the troops of the Red Army who loved his articles.As a Jew, whose mother was killed by the Nazi death squads when she could not escape the German invasion, Grossman was one of the first writers to describe the Nazi death camps.Later, Grossman would work to try to compile a record of the Nazi crimes against the Jews in the USSR, but the anti-Semitic wave of persecution against the Jews in the Soviet Union after the war meant that the book was surpressed and Grossman and other Jewish intellectuals were treated with suspicion.What comes across in Grossman is that he sees the war in terms of what real individuals suffered, struggle to do, and achieved personally. In his portraits of the troops, the Germans, even in his examination of all the history and workings fo the Treblinka death camp, Grossman focuses on what each individual must have felt, must have thought, and how they were moved by the horror of the war around them.This book should be read by anyone who wants to know about this major event in human history.This book should be read by anyone who wants to follow the real heroism of the workers and farmers and soldiers of the USSR who were fighting Hitler under the repressive and dictatorial direction of the Stalin bureaucracy.This book should be read by anyone who loves good prose."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Like the other books of his I've read (Black Book -- really great book), this book manages to be extremely factual yet at the same time emotionally gripping. Grossman's reporting narrative puts you in the time and the place and gives a strong sense of what it was like to be there - the senses, the feelings, the despair, the players, the impact to real people. If you are interested in the Soviet side of the war, or WW2 in general, this is a must read."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Grossman was a Soviet Jew who as a Red Army journalist was on the front lines of some of the most horrific battles of the Second World War. He experienced both Stalingrad and Kursk and was in Berlin when the War in Europe ended. His account of Treblinka was detailed and sobering. This book is a compilation of his journal notes and excerpts from letters describing his day to day experiences.

This is less an integrated narrative than a collection of Grossman's field notes from his service with the Red Army during WW II.To me, that made it both interesting and valuable as a research tool. Grossman made no pretense of being a \\"Soviet Hero\\", but the men he described and the ground they covered together are certainly heroic in their magnitude and impact on future generations.Grossman wasn't really a soldier. He was scooped up the by Red Army and shown how to fire a pistol and then sent out as a correspondent for the Red Army's newspaper. He did a great job covering the titanic maelstrom of battle on the Eastern Front. In that sense, he puts you inside the head of the average Red Army soldier wearing his characteristic headgear, the ultra-practical (for cold weather) Ushanka.Grossman is at Stalingrad. Grossman is there when the first Nazi concentration camps are liberated and his eyewitness of account of Treblinka is still evocative to the point of being painful to read.Although this isn't a narrative description of Grossman's service on the Eastern Front, it does a great job of describing it. Given the intensity of some of Grossman's experiences, I can see why he was never able to put his memoirs together in a conventional narrative form. The editors have done us a great service making these vignettes available to readers interested in the Eastern Front, the Holocaust, WW II, Stalingrad or any of the other major battles Grossman covered.I liked A WRITER AT WAR and gave it five stars."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"An excelent book and recording of the count-less lives and experiences which unfolded as the Eastern front took it's course. No other book I've read gave so much insight to the millions of little stories that each person involved endured and sacrificed. I've read may accounts from the German side but not so many Russian, this is a new angle for me, and the scale of terror and human cost is better shown than ever expected"},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"I purchased this book after reading Grossman's tour de force Life and Fate. This work consists of random snippets from Grossman's notebooks and correspondence as he traveled with the Red Army from 1941-1945. These snippets are placed into historical and geographic context by the translators of his work.At times, the text is captivating and at times horrifying. At others, it seems merely random and poorly organized. The chapter detailing the liberation of Treblinka and Grossman's interviews of the witnesses and survivors was chilling and was read into the record at the war crimes trials at Nuremburg.All in all, this book is a worthwhile read for anyone having an interest in World War II, the Red Army and war in general. Casual readers may not enjoy the experience."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Antony Beevor (who has written two magnificent WWII books himself - \\"Stalingrad' and \\"The Fall of Berlin 1945\\") has extracted from Vasily Grossman's wartime notebooks the best of his many comments on what he saw and did and what happened between the time the Germans invaded Russia on June 22, 1941 and the fall of Berlin four years later. Not only was Grossman a brilliant writer and a keen and humane observer of all this, he was paid to do what he did. That was his job - to oberve, comment and report for the Red Star. And he did a masterful job. Here preserved is the best of his stuff. You should really overlook all of the criticism by some of the cynics and \\"wise men\\" who have previously reviewed this book (and who, I often think, are as interested in showing you how smart they are as in reviewing the book) and read this not only for the overall knowledge you will gain but equally because it brings you right to the battlefield, to the men in the trenches, to the men fighting in the buildings of Stalingrad, to the poor lost souls fighting in the snow and cold and dust and heat in this terible war in which the Russiansa lost 82 men for every 26 Germans (the ratio of US and British servicmen lost per the same figures was 1). Frankly - and I have to say this even though the subject mtter was so tragic - it was a pleasure to read. You will never never forget Grossman's description of Treblinka;my eyes were moist/By all means buy it and read it I cannot recommend it too highly"},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"After the Nazi invasion in June 1940 of the Soviet Union, the journalist Vasily Grossman volunteered for Army service. He was rejected , but this did not deter him. He succeeded in having himself mobilized as a journalist , and almost immediately was sent to the front. Thus began a journalistic adventure which has few parallels. Grossman covered the main stages of the war, from the bitter months of retreat and defeat at the beginning to the terrible liberation of the concentration camps near the end. He was present at many of the major turning points , including the key battle of the war at Stalingrad. He was also present at the battle of Kursk, one of the most massive tank battles in history. His dispatches contained not only his direct observations but his conversations with soldiers of all ranks. They were for the Soviet people a major source of what was happening in the war. And his dispatches were read eagerly throughout the Soviet Union.Grossman who could barely fire a pistol was an unlikely candidate for such heroics. But he was present time and again at the most dangerous places. During one lull he received a two month period where he wrote the short novel 'The People Immortal'which too was immediately published and read throughout the Soviet Union. After writing this he did not wish to rest on his laurels but rather insisted on returning to the Front .The historian Anthony Beevor and the translator Luba Vinogradova have selected from his war dispatches, diaries, and letters, excerpts. Beevor provides a running, chronlogical commentary through which Grossman's entries are interspersed. Reading this book is then something like receiving an impressionistic picture of the action of the war as a whole. This is extremely effective as for instance when we see first Grossman's despair at the beginning of the war at loss of Orel, and his sense of painful triumph at the retaking of the city.Along with the narrative of the overall struggle of the war, there is also Grossman's particular family story. He writes to his father and is filled with guilt at not having summoned his mother from his native Berdichev which was overrun by the Nazis in the early days of the world. She was murdered there.The cosmopolitan Grossman whose Jewishness was secondary has a change of heart when he sees the death - camps at Treblinka and Maidenek. He is the writer of the famous 'Black Book' recording the crimes of the Nazis against the Jews in the areas it took over from the Soviet Union.Grossman is more than a journalist, he is a deeply sensitive artist whose perceptions often form powerful vignettes of human life and suffering. He is a great listener and sympathizer with the people who shows such great understanding in conveying their accounts that we see through him the variety and richness of the whole human landscape of the war.This is a great book by a great writer.I believe that everyone who wishes to 'understand' war insofar as that is possible should have this book in their library."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Well written by frontline journalist. Gives reader insight into the horrors of the war magnified by the ineptitude of Stalin's leadership. First hand anecdotes and vignettes expose the brutality as well as the immense courage necessary to defeat the Germans."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"In June of 1941, an out-of-shape writer in his mid-thirties and walking with a cane reported to the recruiter's office to volunteer for active duty, and to help repel the German invaders that were rolling back the Red Army. His name was Vasily Grossman, and he was turned down. Undaunted, he continued to look for a way to contribute, until finally he caught the ear of the editor for the armed forces newspaper, The Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda), and eventually he was sent to cover the front. He remained at that post for most of the war years, intensely covering the siege of Stalingrad, the Soviet advance through Poland, the liberation of Treblinka, and finally, the assault on Berlin. His accounts from the front lines were read not only by the armed forces, but also followed closely by the civilian population. And during these years, he also kept notebooks of details he noticed along the way - some of which would reappear in his columns, some in the novels he still had to write, and some which, if found, would have sent him to the gulag. 'A Writer at War' is a selection of these jotted observations, compiled in chronological order and interspersed with explanatory text by Antony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova - and they are a fascinating testament to not only their particular time, but to the human condition.Because Grossman's eyewitness accounts are so powerful, it seems almost like foul play to award this book anything but five stars, but the truth is that it isn't Grossman's writing that's off here, but the way the material is assembled. The editors made a choice here to present these notebook excerpts as a corollary to a general history of the eastern front. As such, there are long, expository sections to explain Grossman's whereabouts and to list the units he covered, followed only then by his observations of the people and places. Students of 'The Great Patriotic War' will likely find little that is new here, other than Grossman's rather unconnected notations. His notebooks (at least those excerpted) are not concerned with strategy, or with the larger picture of the war, but with the individual's reaction to and actions during the fighting.So the effort to make a cohesive story from the fragments is likely to be too general for the scholar - but as a reader more or less *only* interested in the individual experiences during the war, the constant intrusion of the editors to mention this unit and that commander and this village and that river began to wear on me after a while. I began to lose interest in the entire project, and found it difficult to maintain my interest level all the way through.With a title like 'A Writer at War', I think the editors missed an opportunity to do something unique with Grossman's notebooks. As a journalist, Grossman was extremely popular, and his writing in The Red Star was followed by civilians as well as the troops. This is mentioned several times - and all I could wonder about was where were the finished efforts inspired by these notebooks. If, instead of commenting on the general history of the war, the editors had reprinted sections from the notebooks, and then followed them with the actual columns Grossman wrote (with perhaps some brief explanatory notes for context), then I think they might have fully explored the possibilities inherent in the title they chose. What *does* a writer do during wartime? And what makes that different from the observations of a butcher or baker? Though we can't know how those on-the-spot notes developed into a narrative that those far from the front could follow and appreciate, the chance to compare and contrast is the closest thing to it.I am well aware that Grossman's articles that saw publication were edited by the authorities to keep them firmly within the party line, and that it might be impossible to draw a straight line from his notebooks to his journalism as printed. Still, Grossman's commitment to recording the 'ruthlessness truth of war', and the fact that, if the editor's are correct, of all the journalists reporting from the front, Grossman was one of the least edited, makes me think that 'A Writer at War' could have been a remarkable testament to the mind of a writer. There's no denying its effect as it is - but could it have been even better?One final note - Grossman's article 'The Hell at Treblinka' is included, and the detailed story of the camp where over three-quarters of a million people were murdered will surely have such a powerful impact that potential readers may at first be tempted to pass up the book so as not to be exposed to its grim reality. I would count myself as one of them. But within the text of this same article, Vasily Grossman refutes the feeble reasons for turning away. 'It is infinitely hard even to read this. The reader must believe me, it is as hard to write it. Someone might ask: 'why write about this, why remember all that? It is the writer's duty to tell this terrible truth, and it is the civilian duty of the reader to learn it. Everyone who would turn away, who would shut his eyes and walk past would insult the memory of the dead.'"},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Grossman was born in 1905, and though he was exempt from fighting in World War II when Hitler invaded Russia (he tried to enlist), he did get a job covering the war for the Red Army newspaper, Red Star, Krasnaya Zvezda.Beevor (author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin, 1945) and Vinogradova have taken Grossman's extensive notes from his war reporting years and some of his published dispatches and combined them into a fascinating and horror-filled account of heroism, shocking brutality from both Germans and Russians, criticism of some officers, and praise for others. Grossman's experiences were coalesced into the novel Life and Fate, which Grossman tied to get published in the Soviet Union. It was suppressed in the 1960s and finally published in the 1980s to great acclaim.Writer at War is full of beautiful brief anecdotes of ordinary people, both army and civilians, and their defense of the Soviet Union. There are short descriptions of bodies, ruins, the frenzied flight of whole towns in front of the invading German forces, the mud, the cold, the food, and the orphaned and abandoned children. These are images we may not want to confront; but we should. Brutal wars and genocide are still going on-and we need to recall what it was like and what it is still like.I have not experienced anything so powerful since I saw Elim Klimov's film about the invasion, Come and See.NOTE: Grossman's report on Treblinka was used in the Nuremberg Military Tribunal, and published in Znamya. Grossman was disillusioned by Stalin's refusal to acknowledge the slaughter of Jews in the Ukraine (among those killed was Grossman's mother). Grossman's articles on this subject were often censored or not used at all.Armchair Interviews says: Powerful stories."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"It is now fashionable to detect substantial improvement in Politburo attitudes during the Nikita Khrushchev years. Unquestionably, his widely-trumpeted \\"deStalinization program\\" included a new tolerance for carefully selected literature that might be considered critical of earlier Soviet behavior. Works including Solzhenitsyn's mildly complaining _One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_ was published in Moscow with the unabashed assistance of Premier Khrushchev himself. But unbridled power rarely permits open critique of its own actions. And the system which supported Khrushchev's near autocracy must be protected from the derogatory gaze of the \\"liberal press.\\" A case in point was the 1961 arrest and suppression of Vasily Grossman, perhaps the Soviet Union's greatest novelist. Grossman, a Ukrainian Jew originally named Iosif, had achieved his incredible fame in the increasingly anti-Semitic Soviet Union through sheer force of his descriptive writing talents, and through a courageous insistence on presenting truth, even during his role as a war reporter while a uniformed soldier of the Soviet Army. To most Russians of the 1950's, Vasily Grossman remained a loyal hero of the victory against Hitler. To the Khrushchev regime, Grossman's greatest novel, _Life and Fate_, would be threat if published. Then as now, national heroes might be sacrificed in the struggle to maintain executive power.We can only speculate on what Khrushchev found so threatening in _Life and Fate_, a fictionalized account of the defense of Stalingrad. When Grossman submitted the manuscript to the censors in 1961, the accurate portrayals of post-war purges of so called \\"Trotskyists-fascists\\" and the \\"cosmopolitans,\\" would still have been embarrassing to Khrushchev. But Grossman's convincing depiction of the heroic Russian peasantry achieving its protracted victory against the \\"Third Reich,\\" despite an incompetent Soviet high command, called into question the wartime viability of the, so called, \\"dictatorship of the proletariat.\\" This could not be tolerated.In 1961, KGB agents stormed Grossman's apartment and the living quarters of his typists. All copies of _Life and Fate_ found were confiscated, as were Grossman's notes, carbon paper, and typewriter ribbons. All of his prior publications became taboo, and were withdrawn from circulation by order of the Cultural Section of the Central Committee. An unemployed pariah on the outs with the Soviet Writer's Union, this hero of the Battle of Stalingrad died of stomach cancer in 1964. Grossman could not have foreseen that an unaccounted copy of the manuscript in the possession of a friend would be smuggled out of Russia in 1980. Published in Switzerland, the work became an overnight bestseller. It was finally published in the Soviet Union in 1989._Life and Fate_ is a novel. Polished prose and seamless narration combine to enhance the coherence of the fictionalized account of the events Grossman witnessed firsthand. Yet Anthony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova's collection, _A Writer at War: A Soviet Journalist with the Red Army, 1941-1945_ recaptures the reservoir of experience that fed that novel. Writer at War provides a competently guided tour to Grossman's own notebooks and journalistic sketches from his three years on the western front.Grossman's initial fame as a writer emerged from these news reports, not from his posthumously published novels. This well edited collection offers readers a sensitive portrayal of humans, somehow coping with the absolute war happening around them. Some of the earliest unclassified reports of the holocaust found their way into the Russian press through the careful medium of Grossman's pen. Among the first Russians to open the destroyed Treblinka death camp, Grossman tells the first published story of the heroic uprising that destroyed the camp. The collection's editors situate each report and notebook within an up-to-date historical backdrop that sometimes corrects, but always makes Grossman's original more coherent, while preserving the intrinsic drama and feel of an eyewitness account. This important memoir should be read by the hoards of WWII buffs who often forget the nightmare that occurred in the eastern theater of the European war. But literary historians and students of cultural resilience will find fascinating this well crafted chronicle."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"A Writer at War is one of the best books I've ever read. Vasily Grossman has an excellent eye for detail and the humanity to convey the bitterness of the titanic struggle between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The portraits of the intense suffering of the ordinary Russian people and their courage and generosity despite terrible hardship are what stayed in my mind.The chapter describing Treblinka death camp was extremely harrowing and underlined the moral and military victory of the war.An excellent book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Grossman's frontline dispatches are organised in sequence by the two editor/translators. These are gritty vignates about the soldiers at the front. Grossman is much more interested in the men than the commanders. He interviews them all, but his heart is with the men.The intervening commentary by the editors is very helpful in understanding the context of these passages."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Grossman, most famous for his Tolstoyan work, 'Life and Fate' was, first and foremost, a journalist. He spent the majority of the Second World War on the front lines, witnessing some of the most violent confrontations of the war. He was in Stalingrad, widely acknowledged as the bloodiest battle in history. He was at Kursk, the major tank battle of the war and the military turning point-Stalingrad being the psychologic hinge-of-fate for Nazi Germany's imperialistic and ideological ambitions. He was at Treblinka during it's liberation and in Berlin during the final death-throes of the Nazi beast. In other words, he was an eye-witness to all the major events on the Eastern Front.This book, cleverly and unobtrusively edited and translated by Vinogradova and Beevor excerpt relevant segments from Grossman's diaries. These wartime diaries were kept at great personal risk, since such activities were prohibited by the Stalin government. While many of the depictions of the attitudes and behaviors of Soviet soldiers seem redolant of 'socialist realist' propaganda, the descriptions of Treblinka and the author's sentient observations on Soviet military men are obviously the product of a gifted writer and psychologist.The reader should recall that these diary entries were not intended for publication but rather were kept by Grossman to provide source material for future literary efforts. Unfortunately, Grossman fell afoul of Stalin, largely for his efforts to publicize the fate of Jews at the hands of the Nazis and secondarily for failing to sufficiently promote the role of Stalin's leadership and the Party in the Battle of Stalingrad. As a result, 'Life and Fate' was only published posthumously and stomach cancer claimed the author's life before much of the raw materials presented in this book could be crafted into a final literary effort. Any serious student of WW-II should read this book, as it is a major contribution to understanding the Soviet perspective on the 'Great Patriotic War'."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"I'm very glad I've read this book, because it is truly one of the greatest, if not the greatest eye-witness account of the war on the eastern front. The chapter about the liberation of Dachau and the writer's thoughts about the Holocaust made me shiver, I've read dozens of books on the Holocaust but nobody ever put it to paper like Vassily did.

You will never forget it."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Grossman's ability to convey and tell the truth to a people desperate for \\"news\\" under the circumstances of his day was nothing short of inspirational and so very human. His narrative of the discovery of Treblinka is vivid, horrifying, and a chapter of required reading for anyone seeking to understand the unvarnished truth of the holocaust.

Beevor contextualises Grossman's notes and editorials for Red Star but leaves Grossman to tell the story. Whilst history books can provide a detached description of events they cannot provide the level of intimacy and humanity that Grossman's interviews (from civilians to generals) and observations, at most of the key moments of the war, provide.An understated man, he seems to have the trustworthiness for people to open up to him and you can feel the personality and character of the Russian people as individuals rather than a faceless homogenous mass.You travel the path of retreat, teater on the brink of defeat, and feel their savage joy in fighting back.The most powerful sections have to be that of Stalingrad and Treblinka, the former for the incredible strength of human spirit to survive and the latter for the shocking industrial scale of the state sanctioned murder in which many freely collaborated.Whilst Grossman was a Jew and clearly feels the suffering of fellow Jews at this time you feel he is a Soviet citizen first and foremost and loves the diversity of his people.An excellent insight."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was \\"human\\" in his writing, if he had not been so popular as a correspondent for the official Red Army newspaper. If the USSR had broken up after Stalin died, maybe he could have compiled all his notes himself into a great read about the ordinary soldiers and all the generals, but the editor and translater did well putting his notes in order and tying them together to make sense of it for us.

Editor Anthony Beevor has done a great job cherry-picking through these notebooks, which are complete except for one section covering the first part of the battle of Stalingrad. Readers familiar with the political climate of the Soviet Union will gulp in trepidation at some of Grossman's notes--if these had fallen into the hands of the NKVD, he would have been fired, jailed, or worse.Some notes are rapid-fire burst of observations, others are candid interviews with the troops. A few are ruminations on the situations, which would later show up in his fictional works. Here are some fair-use excerpts:\\"...our soldiers really started to ask themselves, why did the Germans attack us so suddenly? Why did the Germans need this terrible and unfair war? Millions of our men have now seen the rich farms in East Prussia, the highly organized agriculture, the concrete sheds for livestock, spacious rooms, carpets, wardrobes full of clothes . . . the well-built roads . . . and the German autobahns . . . the two storey suburban houses with electricity, gas, bathrooms and beautifully tended gardens . . . the villas of the rich bourgeoisie in Berlin, theunbelievable luxury of castles, estates and mansions. And thousands of soldiers repeat these angry questions when they look around them in Germany: \\"But why did they come to us? What did they want?\\"\\"At war, I have seen only two kinds of reaction to the things happening around one: either extreme optimism, or complete gloom. Transition from one to the other is quick and sudden, and easy. There is nothing in between. No one lives with the thought that the war is going to be long, that only hard work, month after month, could lead to victory. Even those who say so don't believe it. There are only two feelings: the first one--the enemy is defeated; the other one--the enemy cannot be defeated.\\"A photographer remarks, 'I saw some very good refugees yesterday.'\\"Heinkels and Junkers are flying at night. They spread among the stars like lice. The blackness of air is filled with their humming. Bombs are crashing down. Villages are burning all around. The dark August sky become lighter. When a star falls down, or when there is thunder during the day, everyone gets scared, but then they laugh: 'That's from the sky, from the real sky.'\\"Battle at night. Cannonade. Field guns bang, shells howl, first in a shrill tone, then humming like wind. Barking of mines. A lot of rapid, white fire. The tap dance of machine guns and rifles is the most disturbing. Green and white German rockets. Their light is mean, dishonest, not like daylight. A ripple of shots. People are neither seen nor heard. It is like a riot of machines.\\""},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"A close up account of the 1941 - 1945 German/Russian conflict with good editorial commentary. Provides interesting anecdotes amount famous conflicts such as Stalingrad and the Fall of Berlin."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"most impressive read on the russian war in wwii"},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"This book offers nothing new for scholars on the Eastern Front; all the facts can be found in other sources, many are referenced in the Source Notes. For the lay reader there may be some new revelations: the partition of Poland in 1939; the brutality inflicted by the Soviet soldiers on the local populace and \\"collaborators\\" at the end of the war; or the ruthlessness of the NKVD during the war to Soviet soldiers and people.The book's beauty is reliving of the chaos and confusion, experienced by Grossman, though he was never at the front, per se, but at best a few steps back with the commanders or in secure bunkers. The authors do an excellent job of bringing Grossman's notes to life. The story is very readable, as the authors weave fact and fiction. Some of the fiction is clearly identified (e.g. kills claimed by the sniper Zaitsev). Other fictions are left unchallenged presumably because of the obvious hyperbole (e.g. 1305 kills by a mortarman in 2 months at Stalingrad). Propaganda by nature is an exaggeration or even fiction. Some of the soldiers or officers interviewed knew exaggeration was the only way to fame or sometimes self preservation. Grossman dutifully recorded the stories as they were told. Some stories were then further exaggerated by the Soviets (e.g. 10 km became 20 km). On the other hand, some pervasive fiction is debunked (e.g. Germans capture of Orel). During war it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. The authors allow this juxtaposition to exist to help the reader feel the confusion and chaos that soldiers experience.On the hand some fiction was inappropriate. For example, the authors deftly mentioned in the introduction that \\"Stalinist agents are said to have spread the rumor that the Jews were responsible for the famine\\" in the 30's. This is repeated hearsay, which does not belong. One fiction Grossman raised, the authors left stand until the last chapter, specifically the Soviet anti-Semitism that Grossman and other Jews perceived. The authors should have identified this as such at the first mention rather than allowing it to be repeated, unchallenged. Not doing so leaves the perception with reader that it truly existed. In the last chapter the authors confirm that anti-Semitism began only AFTER the war. (This has been confirmed in Khrushchev's memoirs by his son.) Stalin simply refused to treat the Jews differently than any other Soviet citizen. For this, Grossman and others felt Stalin was anti-Semitic, when in reality Stalin realized that \\"a house divided cannot stand.\\"Clearly Grossman has a viewpoint and the authors not only allow, it but support it. Grossman was not fond of the Nazi's (no surprise there). However, he also disparaged the English and Americans (quite a surprise). Aspersions were cast Stalin's way (a slight surprise). In general, he exalted the front line troops, at least until he saw their brutality to the Germans in the final days. But the Jews could do no wrong. Wherever good was being done, it was done by a Jew. Grossman documented one Jewish officer protecting the wife and girls of a Gestapo man in the final days. Grossman himself refused to allow looting of the houses that he stayed in. For Grossman, I am sure this chauvinism was unconscious; the authors maintained this bias throughout.If you can get thru the chauvinism, or at least take it with a grain of kosher salt, it makes for a very engrossing read. The authors allow you to feel, as Grossman did, the confusion in the early part of the war, the uplift after Stalingrad, the politics of the generals as each competed to out-claim the other, and the depravity of the conclusion. I suspect Semite Grossman would be pleased with the book."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"I walk mid shamble smear and stench, The dead I mourn.\\" John Finley.The Soviet journalist and author Vasily Grossman did more than kneel behind the soldier's trench. He lived with the Red Army from the catastrophic summer of 1941, through the defense of Moscow, the apocalyptic carnage of Stalingrad, the hard-won liberation of Soviet territory, the horrible discoveries of Nazi genocide in Madjanek and Treblinka, and the final bloody, triumphant march into Berlin. Anthony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova's \\"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army 1941-1945\\" is a marvelous examination of both \\"Grossman's war\\" and the war itself.Vasily Grossman is something of a forgotten, unsung giant of Soviet literature. Born in Berdichev, Ukraine in 1905, Grossman rose to prominence and received national acclaim as a war reporter for Red Star, the official newspaper of the Red Army. Although never a member of the Communist Party, Grossman was, for most of his life, a strong supporter of the Soviet Union. Grossman's reporting was realistic (despite editing by Party censors) and was enormously popular among both high ranking officers and foot soldiers. After the war, Grossman returned to writing. His magnum opus, Life and Fate was not published in the USSR until 1988. When it was originally submitted for publication the Soviet authorities \`arrested' the book and told Grossman that it would not be published for 200 years. Fortunately, a copy of the manuscript survived, was smuggled to Switzerland and published in Europe in 1980, fifteen years after Grossman's death. Life and Fate was based, in good part, on Grossman's wartime experiences. Consequently, Beevor's work provides both an historical, ground-level examination of the war generally and a great deal of insight into the life experiences that formed the moral foundation of Grossman's novels.Beevor (and his translator and collaborator Vinogradova) have taken Grossman's notebooks, war diaries, personal correspondence and his Red Star articles and set them out as part of their narrative. The transition from Grossman's text to the commentary is well thought out and seamless. Beevor is no stranger to the Eastern Front, (he has written two well received books\\"Stalingrad\\" and \\"The Fall of Berlin\\") and he does an excellent job of putting Grossman's writings into the context of his times.Grossman is swept into the war as a reporter for Red Star immediately after the German invasion in June, 1941. Grossman's writing (and Beevor's commentary) takes us through that first disastrous summer of defeat, despair, death, and retreat. The magnificent and bloody defense of Stalingrad follows and the success of Operation Uranus in November, 1942 that resulted in the encirclement and destruction of General Paulus' Sixth Army follows. The next portion of the book has Grossman writing about the Red Army on the offensive, from the Battle of Kursk through the liberation of the Ukraine and then Poland. It is here that Grossman first learns of the horror that was the holocaust.Grossman's reports from Treblinka were the first, first-hand accounts of the Nazi death camps and what Grossman saw changed his life. Although Jewish, Grossman had always considered himself a secular citizen of the USSR. The death camps and the murder of his mother at the hands of Nazis and Ukrainian collaborators reawakened his sense of a Jewish identity even though he remained totally secular. Grossman's experience of the camps and the evidence he saw there of man's innate inhumanity to man stunned him even after almost 4 years of living with brutality on an unfathomable scale. In ending one of his reports Grossman writes: \\"It is infinitely hard even to read this. The reader must believe me, it is as hard to write it. Someone might ask: \\"Why write about all this, why remember all that?\\" It is the writer's duty to tell this terrible truth, and it is the civilian duty of the reader to learn it.\\"It is clear from reading A Writer at War and two of Grossman's novels, \\"Life and Fate\\" and \\"Forever Flowing\\" that Grossman took his duty to tell his terrible truth seriously. Beevor has done Grossman a good service by letting Grossman's voice be heard again. I hope this book creates renewed interest in Grossman's life and writing."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"What I loved about this book is that Grossman wrote both about the good and the bad. He could admit about the Red Army having 'cowards' in its ranks and about the executions that followed. But at the same time you can read about a soldier who was sentenced to be executed, the executioners gun misfired, the soldier ran away and was hidden by a commissar for days. Eventually after many inquiries and the fact that the soldier came back on his own accord his death sentence was rescinded and he followed the commissar around all the time, when asked why he replied \\"I am afraid that the Germans may kill you, Comrade Commissar. I am guarding you.\\"Another recollection is about a soldier who accidentally shot another Red Army man, he was so sick with grief that he eventually killed himself. The retreats of 1941 are covered in some detail as Grossman was right there on the front, a few times even narrowly avoiding the encirclements themselves. He ate with the troops, slept with them, wrote letters with them, and interviewed them again and again. From pilots, to artillery and mortar men, to tank troops and nurses. Stories of how girls went into battle outside of Stalingrad and throughout the war, how they died just as quickly and easily as any man and how they fought just as proudly and courageously risking their lives to bandage the wounded and evacuate them from the battlefield.Stalingrad of course consumes a large portion of the book as this was Grossman's forte, he was there for a large part of the siege and the stories from this city are captivating to say the least. Snipers were quite popular and he interviewed many of them finding out how they came to be snipers and how they did their jobs so well.Lastly is the liberation of territory from the Germans and Romanians and of course the war being taken to Germany. He holds nothing back while describing the destruction the German Army reigned over his land and eventually discovering that his mother was among the victims of an execution of the entire Jewish population of his him town. When Treblinka is discovered the reader is presented with a large article about it, some of the stories recounted are heartbreaking and at the same time he shows how many times Jews rebelled and fought back, on dozens of occasions. Covered are the rapes and robberies of Germans and Germany as a whole, Grossman holds nothing back and talks about the screaming of women and their bruised and swollen bodies and faces when he encounters them sobbing and asking for help. One incident stayed in my memory, a Jewish officer was billeted in a house that used to belong to a Gestapo man who had run away. His family, a mother and her girls, begged this man to stay and protect them, this Jewish Red Army officer who had his entire family killed by the Germans. If one wants to understand with what stride these Red Army men fought and died, how easily the line was crossed between life and death and how they eventually triumphed, this book will answer many of your questions."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"I have done a fair amount of reading on the \\"Russian War\\" and have read Grossman's \\"Life and \\"Fate.\\" Of all these books \\"A Writer at War\\" stands out. Anthony Beevor has done a fine job of creating the narrative, filling in the gaps and explaining the situation the Russian Army and Vasily Grossman found from 1941 to 1945.This book brings the overall arc of the war, the great battles and the agony of officers, soldiers and civilians into full view. Most memorable are his up close descriptions of Stalingad and his searching interviews in his Ukranian hometown where his mother was executed along with twenty thousand Jews. His description of the heroism of young women at Stalingard is extremely moving. The section on the Treblinka concentration camp, where nearly a million people were exterminated, was used at the Nurenberg Trials and has an immediacy that is profoundly affecting even after all these years and all we know about the Holocaust.I cannot recommend this book too highly, particularly in conjunction with \\"Life and Fate\\" and other histories of the Russian-German cataclysm."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"I started this book with misgivings. The introduction informed me it was the unpublished notes of Grossman's war correspondence, rather than the stories themselves. I've been a reporter, and let's just say my unpublished notes will never win a National Book Award. I also gathered that \\"Life and Fate\\", rather than this, was Grossman's masterwork, so perhaps I should have gone directly to it.I was completely and thankfully wrong. Edited by noted historian Anthony Beevor, an expert on Stalingrad, and collaborator Luba Vinogradova, the book expertly sets vignettes from Grossman's notes into ample background material putting it all in context.Grossman's reportage sweeps from the stunning fall of the western Soviet Union following Germany's invasion in June 1941, to the epic battle of Stalingrad in 1942 and early 1943, to the reconquest of Soviet lands, the taking of Berlin, and war's end.Grossman distinguishes himself both by his willingness to expose himself to combat and his ability to get everyone to open up to him, from peasant soldiers to tight-lipped generals. This was no mean feat for a Jewish intellectual whom many Russians despised just for who he was.You see an entire nation shell-shocked by war. They've fought so long they can't remember what peace is like. They've lived so long in the mud they can't remember what it's like to be clean or warm or dry. They don't care about getting paid because there's nothing to buy at the front. They have seen so much death; millions of people take it for granted they won't survive the war, and many are right. They die fighting with a uniquely Slavic romanticism otherwise vanished from the modern world, and despite the violence behind them - just at Stalingrad, thousands of Red Army soldiers were executed by their own commissars.We see the heroism of countless soldiers thrown into the meatgrinder of Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga, where Stalin finally realizes he's got no more ground to give and must stop the Nazis now.Powerful too, and more unique, are later chapters where Grossman covers the Red Army's rollback to the west, where he learns what actually happened to more than a million Jews living there - including his hometown of Berdichev, where his mother was murdered.He writes the first take on the Holocaust wherever he goes from 1943 to 1945. He was the first reporter into much of the annihilated Jewish Pale in the Ukraine and Byelorussia; the first into Treblinka and Majdanek. But the Communists stunningly censored any reference to the Holocaust's victims as Jews. Stalin wanted them seen merely as Soviets, and the Ukrainian complicity covered up to ease the Ukraine's postwar reabsorption.At Treblinka, the Nazis, having spent almost two years mass murdering the Jews of Poland and neighboring areas, then spent more than six months disinterring 800,000 bodies from mass graves to destroy the evidence - starting, Grossman learns, precisely when Stalingrad fell to the Russians and the Germans realized the war was lost. They burned those corpses in bonfires that, day and night, could be seen 25 miles away. Grossman describes this in grisly detail.Inmates rebelled and destroyed the camp in the summer of 1943 and the Germans subsequently destroyed it, trying to disguise the site as a farm - one where, however, countless bits of human bone and scraps of clothing and documents and household goods were littered throughout the soil. These attested to the truth of what Grossman was told by a handful of survivors who emerge at liberation from nearby forests. Grossman's retelling of what happened to victims from the moment they emerged from the trains to their walk naked down a sandy path to the gas chambers, shocks even those of us now familiar with the subject. Think how much stronger this would have read when the world was first hearing about it. History and time have added detail, but not essence, to what Grossman, first on the scene, has to say about it."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Vasily Grossman's \\"A Writer at War\\" is a firsthand account by a Soviet newspaper correspondent of life with the Red Army on the Eastern Front. There are no punches pulled here and Grossman vividly describes the absolutely catastrophic impact Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on June 1941 had on the Red Army. In the first six months of the war the old Red Army was virtually annihilated by the German Wehrmacht, suffering more than five million casualties, including some 3.3 million Soviet soldiers captured. In all, more than 177 Soviet divisions were lost. Grossman describes the panic, cowardice, desertion, treason and just plain command incompetence as the Red Army struggles to escape its attackers.He also shows, however, that as newly formed divisions were pushed forward and the situation slowly stabilized, Red Army soldiers were keen to strike back at the Germans. \\"Night. Snowstorm. Vehicles. Artillery,\\" writes Grossman. \\"They are moving in silence. Suddenly a hoarse voice is heard at a road junction: 'Hey, which is the road to Berlin?' A roar of laughter.\\" This was in January 1942, when the Red Army was still being hammered by the Germans. Indeed, on New Years Day 1942, Grossman writes his wife: \\"The horizon is clearing for us. There is a feeling of confidence and strength in the army, and each day brings the victory closer...\\"Editor and noted historian Anthony Beevor augments the excellent text throughout the book with insightful and informative footnotes. For example, Beevor notes that some 422,700 Red Army soldiers died in punishment battalions during the war trying to expiate their crimes. Beevor also describes the Soviet soldiers fear of being mutiliated or crippled. \\"There was of course, the unshakeable belief that a woman would never want to look at them again,\\" writes Beevor.What makes Grossman's story so compelling is that he was a Jew and witnessed almost all the major battles of the Eastern Front. He thus experienced anti-Semitism, both latent and blatant, which ran relatively rampant in the Red Army. Still, he undertook to record events as accurately as possible, presenting the reader with a tremendously well written (Grossman was a novelist before the war) and incredibly insightful and well balanced view of the war and the Red Army.Later, as the atrocities of Holocaust were uncovered, Grossman undertook to record them. His report \\"The Hell of Treblinka\\" was used as evidence at the Nurnberg tribunal. Still, after the war the Soviet government prevented him from publishing his masterful novel \\"Life and Fate\\", about the seige of Leningrad. Years later it was smuggled out and published in the West.Vasily Grossman's \\"A Writer at War\\" is an important contribution to the new World War II memoirs by soldiers of the Red Army and ranks among the best works in that genre written to date."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Teh broad history of the German invasion of Russia is well known, but most of our information comes from German sources. The secrecy surrounding the Communist Government after the war prevented wide spread distribution of the Russian side of the story. Only lately have the Russian stories begun to imerge.This book is likely to be one of the standards by which others are compared. Vasily Grossman, mid-thirties, portly, Jewish was deemed unfit for service in the Red Army. Instead he became a war correspondent for 'The Red Star,' and spent the war reporting on almost all of the major events on the Eastern Front. He appears to have been everywhere: The Battle of Moscow, Kursk, Stalingrad followed by Treblinka. He made copious notes and later converted these into his articles. Here two new translators have taken his original notes and converted them to a narrative of the war years.Mr. Grossman was not a favorite of the Communists. He reported on the plight of the Jews, against the communist wishes that all suffering Russians be treated alike. And as the Red Army advanced into Germany he reported on their actions in ways that again the communists didn't like.His experiences in the War became the basis for many of Mr. Grossman's books. They were banned by the Soviets. He died in 1964, convinced that his life's work had been a failure. This book, and all the others now available from Amazon prove that it was not."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"With 'A Writer at War', Anthony Beevor has produced a remarkable book that succeeds in a number of ways: as a biography of a crucial period in an important writers life, as a compelling eye-witness account of the most brutal conflict in history, and in revealing the inspiration and source material for two of the most significant works of literature from the last century, 'Life and Fate' and 'The Black Book'. This last aspect is the most original and most revealing, as throughout this wonderful piece of research Beevor points you to characters and events that were to appear in both books, although sadly Grossman didn't live to see either published; as both were suppressed by Stalin.Most readers of 'A Writer at War' will come to it from an interest in the events and time period it covers, but I hope they will leave with a desire to read Grossman's masterpiece 'Life and Fate', as everything he witnessed during that tumultuous period of history are contained within it's pages.My full review can be found at thebookforum.com"},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"Vasili Semenovich Grossman was a decorated Soviet military journalist best known in the West for his epic novel,Life and Fate (New York Review Books Classics). In 'A Writer at War' editors and translators Anthony Beevor (Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943), an esteemed historian and author in his own right, and Luba Vinogradova, follow Grossman's progression through the war by piecing together stories from his notebooks and writings. At times one would have liked a bit more context to be provided by Beevor, but that is a minor quibble.Grossman, while still a loyal Communist at this point, managed to maintain a relatively objective viewpoint. He often pushed his editors to allow him to write stories they did not want written, in particular regarding the fate of the Jews in the Ukraine under German occupation and the role of the Ukrainians.While at time the stories have to be stitched together from bits and pieces, \`A Writer at War' is a gold mine and provides a rare view into the inner workings of the Soviet military and Soviet military journalism in particular. Grossman experienced the initial German onslaught and the Russian flight from it, Stalingrad, the tank battle at Kursk, and the death camps.

If it had been in a linear sort of narrative, so we could feel the progression of the drama, and we could get used to the comings and goings of our narrator, it would have been a great book. But we have only scattered pieces, fading images of a soul soaked in the pain of war, glimpses of horrors witnessed and stories that remain untold.It's what it hints at that gives it its precious value: the authenticity and honesty of the man, Grossman. But it lacks a linear storytelling; it leaves a chaotic impression of imprecise locations and hard-to-pronounce names. I'm the first to be sorry about this impression, nevertheless it is what it is. I would have packed the best passages into a short book, made it more concise and more precise."},{"Title":"A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945","review":"This is one of the very best books to come out of the War in the East. A combat journalist, Grossman saw as much action as many combat veterans. Comparable to America's Ernie Pyle, Grossman wrote with a common, sympathetic manner that powerfully conveys complex and highly emotional stories. Anyone who professes to be a serious student of the War in the East absolutely must read this book. Be warned; however, that Grossman's writings on Treblinka and other scenes of Nazi genocide are horrific and the pain they convey is staggering (his mother was one of the millions of victims of Nazi genocide). Do not read this book unless you are prepared to deal with some of the most gut-wrenchingly honest and brutal writing of your life."},{"Title":"Trackside around St. Louis 1952-1959 with Jim Ozment","review":"Morning Sun Books' Trackside series includes some titles focusing on a single railroad, and other titles encompasing all railroads within a specific geographic area. As should be obvious from this volume's title, this is a geographic look at the numerous railroads serving the St. Louis area during the 1950's, before the Gateway Arch replaced Union Station tower as the city's best known landmark.Because St. Louis ranked second only to Chicago for the number of railroads serving the city, the photographic coverage of this colorful picture book is somewhat limited as to the number of pages available to each specific company. But overall, the book offers a diverse glimpse of late steam operations, colorful first generation diesels, streetcars and interurban electric railroading. Following is a list of included railroads and topics with the number of pages devoted to each:Bridges of St. Louis (3), Alton & Southern (2), Baltimore & Ohio (4), Chicago & Eastern Illinois (2), Chicago & Northwestern (2), Chicago Burlington & Quincy (7), Bevier & Southern (1), New York Central's Big Four route (8), Gulf Mobile & Ohio (4), Illinois Central (4), Illinois Terminal (6), Indiana Northern (1), Louisville & Nashville (1), Missouri-Kansas-Texas (2), Missouri Pacific (20), Nickel Plate Road (2), Pennsylvania (4), St. Louis Public Service Co. (3), St. Louis Water Works (1), St. Louis-San Francisco (Frisco) (14), St. Louis Southwestern (Cotton Belt) (1), Terminal Railroad Association (11), Wabash (16) and National Museum of Transport (4).If you are interested in only a few specific companies, you may want to inspect the volume before purchasing. But if you are a fan of St. Louis, Eastern Missouri-Southern Illinois or Midwest railroading in general, this volume well illustrates a place where Eastern, Southern andWestern railroads met to interchange freight and passengers."},{"Title":"Wee Willie Winkie","review":"Editions abound of 22-year old Rudyard Kipling's 1888 collection of 14 Anglo-Indian short stories, WEE WILLIE WINKIE AND OTHER CHILD STORIES reissued and revised by the author in 1895. You should rejoice if the edition you are perusing (like mine) is PENGUIN CLASSICS, edited by Hugh Haughton. Its 52-page Introduction gives the Anglo-Indian working context of Kipling's last of \\"seven years hard\\" as an assistant editor of two respected, jointly-owned newspapers for the British in India: soldiers, civil servants, merchants, tea planters, traders, schoolmasters and their wives.Somehow the young newspaperman made time for an impressive collection of poems and short stories published in india before he left it in 1888 for travels in North America en route to a full time writing career in 1889 London. Kipling persuaded even younger &Eacute;mile Moreau (1877-1959) French author and co-founder of India's bookstore chain A.H. Wheeler & Co. to publish before the end of 1888 his selected poems and prose to date in the first six pamphlets of the newly created Indian Railway Library. These collector's items were illustrated by Rudyard's learned father and artist John Lockwood Kipling. Moreau advertised Kipling's collections as \\"illustrations of the four main features of Anglo-Indian life, viz., the Military, Domestic, Native and Social.\\"-- We meet Mrs Lucy Hauksbee, a recurring character, as one of many old and young \\"grass widows\\" (i.e. British women married but with husbands conveniently absent) who populate Simla, British India's summer capital at 7, 000 feet altitude in the hot season). Her self-assigned missions in life include polishing the rough edges of young male admirers, telling her best girl friend and slightly more charitable bungalow mate Mrs Polly Mallowe what is wrong with all the other women in Simla, especially the way they dress.-- We catch glimpses of Kipling himself roving around India from one nasty dak-bungalow (government mail (\\"dak\\") overnight quarters for men traveling on official business) to another, encountering a ghost and at other times meeting fellow Masons like Peachy Carnahan and Daniel Dravot (in \\"The Man who would be King\\").-- We encounter a soldier who falls into a giant unclimbable pit on the banks of the Sutlej river populated by native Indians who were thought dead (usually of cholera) but found not to be so at the burning ghats and dumped unceremoniously over the edges. Why not wade simply across the river? Guards would shoot you. Or quicksand would suck you under.-- Men and women go mad, die or linger in guilt till they die -- miserably.-- Young boys from five to 14 (including (a) a colonel's young son nicknamed \\"Wee Willie Winkie,\\" and (b) an abused Rudyard Kipling and younger sister Trix in \\"Baa, Baa Black Sheep\\") do things to make them grow up quickly in England or in Queen Victoria's Anglo-Indian Raj. Two of them, a drummer boy and a fifer, courage imbibed from a bottle, lead a panicked regiment back into victory over Pathan warriors during the second Aghan War.A great read.

There will be some limitations. Those are apparent here in the method--what was learned by two journalists assigned to Chechnya for a 3 year period, approximately, in the mid-1990s. The book was published in 1998.Despite those method weaknesses, and others pointed out by other reviewers, I recommend this book for a few reasons. It is a harkening back to the time of Yeltsin, whom it seemed the American administrations were very fearful of living without--now we have some history with Mr. Putin. And, we know the epilogue is continued problems with the Chechens, and Islam. In this regard the book is a very readable prologue to what we faced after 9/11, and provides some historical background. It doubt that 1 of 100 Americans could find Chechnya on a map, yet this is part of the world region that will determine the fate of the world.Highly recommended for intelligence and counterintelligence enthusiasts, because you have to learn a new way of thinking to understand this conflict. It isn't the Cold War, and it isn't the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"As of the writing of this book, the Chechnyans had successfully repelled the Russian army and achieved a de facto independence that was not recognized by the rest of the world. Subsequent events have shown that Russia was not through with Chechnya by a long shot. This is a fascinating and grusome account of how Russia first attempted to pacify its rebellious province and how the Chechnyan hatred of the Russians goes back well over a hundred years. Stalin deported the entire population of the area to Central Asia during World War Two, cementing the Checnyans hatred of Moscow. That the West has allowed the slaughter in Chechnya to continue without more than a peep of a protest is shameful. This is a compelling book that deserves a wider audience, as well as a sequel."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"this book doesn't fail to tell the truth. This book tells the truth, the side not being told by the russians, or by the media. We all hear on the news about apartment bombings in russia, but we aren't told about the mass graves, about the genocide or the history of the chechen-russian conflict. Recent war crimes such as kidnapping and rape of underage chechen girls by russian generals don't make the news. the book provides an important historical context to the selected information we are given every day. This book may not be up to date, but history is very important to understanding the now. Things happen every day in chechnya.The book doesn't fail to touch on the black market of chechnya, and how thugs took control in the aftermath of the devestation put upon them by the russians. You don't have to be a mujaheddin to read this book, or to like it. it is a comprehensive history of chechnya and the history of the conflict with voice given to those who are often not allowed the chance to speak in the international realm. I also highly recommend \\"chienne de guerre\\" for those who are interested in chechnya but aren't ready to swallow a history book full of dates and names.Marsho!"},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"I would not have reviewed this book (which I bought and do not regret: it contains some factual information I did not know), if not Igor's comment. Not that he does not have a point - he makes some points I agree. More, also I do respect his desire to protect a honor of his nation, which the book does insult.Book is not objective, neither is Igor. He recounts Shamil Basaev's story from 1991 and then jumps to 1995 Budionovsk... Is it because Igor does not know what Basaev was doing in between? well, I do. I think, Igor preferred to leave out, what Russians would rather forget, but without those years, there might have been no \\"famous warlord Basaev\\"... So, here is the part Igor \\"forgot\\" to tell about: basaev was in Russian GRU (military intelligence) training camp getting ready for his role of \\"freedom fighter\\" for then-his-Russian-masters. He was trained and equipped to lead Russian supported rebellion in Georgian province of Abkhazia... He did fight that war and got all the experience Igor hates him for (now) - brutal and bloody... But... all the Russian media was SO happy to call Basaev Freedom Fighter then, in 1992-1993. Was it because \\"they were finding in him what they did not possess???\\"...For Russians Basaev became a terrorist #1 only after he did the very same things he was called Freedom Fighter for IN Georgia, against Russians themselves. It was only then when Russians stopped thinking of him as \\"brave and skilled commander...\\"Hypocrisy is a REALLY bad thing, on that I am with Igor."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"It is funny how the public opinion of many small European countries is reluctant to recognize necessity of a burden, which large states -USA, China, India or Russia must carry. This burden is opposing terrorism (regardless of it's origin). These small countries it seems to me are enjoying being an impediment. For example, Danish authorities have refused to extradite Akhmed Zakayev to Russia. Russia wanted him, because allegedly this spokesman of the Chechen guerillas was involved in the terrorist activities. The Danes disagreed and let him freely leave the country. The Belgian embassy in London issued him a European Visa several months before. Some Dutchmen unfortunately are no better. The Netherlands is home country of the publisher of \`Moscow Times' and the authors of \`Chechnya' - who were also correspondents of this paper in 1997. I think the paper is alright, and both Gall and de Waal obviously have some strong journalistic qualities. But I think they have totally failed to give a balanced account on Chechnya, to the point where some pages sound to me like a mouthpiece for the Chechen rebels.Coming back to my point, these small countries are enjoying being on the sidelines, comfortably placed in the Northern fringes of Europe. And all they do is criticizing countries, which stuck with unpleasant role. Why? May be these two authors of \`Chechnya' are seeking in Chechens the qualities that they don't have, or their home countries don't possess? They don't have high mountains, deserts or the Islamic Shariah Law, for sure. May be the bored European intellectuals are tired the liberal democracy and seek truths in Islam or, perhaps, Whirling Dervishes? May be some of them are like this kid from the West Coast family of means - John Walker Lindh - who joined Taliban in Afghanistan. I do not know, may be Vanessa Redgrave knows. But it is strange to read a book, in which none other than Shamil Basayev is called \`a gifted commander', or \`witty' and \`personable'. Although the authors know perfectly well that in Russia this person is like Osama bin Laden for the United States. Enemy number one.The Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev started out with high-jacking of a Russian plane to Turkey in 1991. Then he personally headed the devastating raid to the Russian town of Budyonnovsk in 1995 when the biggest ever number of hostages was taken - more than 1,000 people. Many people were killed during this incursion. Basayev personally ordered execution of some of the hostages, as it is described in the book. Nevertheless, Gall and de Waal took the position, which is not uncommon in the European intellectual circles. This position boils down to the following: the Chechens have the noble intentions; this is the Russians who force them to do bad things. And the Russians deserve it anyway.At least this is a position. Sure, the Russian army didn't manage the Chechen war well from the humanitarian point of view. The war was messy and brutal as sometimes war is. Often they acted heavy-handedly, not only because they faced the fiercest resistance from the Chechens, but also they were not ready. The Russians were unprepared for the war, since the country was in economic and political turmoil after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Many were avoiding the draft. Russian army was demoralized and wasn't even trained for this kind of mountain guerilla war, where would be no fixed front line and where wouldn't be possible to tell enemy from the friend. The internal armed insurgency led by the group of tough thugs fanatically devoted to their cause was something new to the Russians, and they were not ready to deal with it. It turned out Russians couldn't just coax the Chechens with compromises - they had to fight, if they wanted to keep the Russian federation alive. But it also turned out that the way the Russians started to fight was wrong.But was it there an alternative to fighting? The authors are silent. The danger was further disintegration of Russia, as others would be looking to chip away like Chechnya. Chechnya was not Afghanistan. Not only it was a member of Russian Federation, it is also had 250,000 -strong Russian community. Also the huge difference with Afghanistan was the fact that the Chechen Mujaheddin, unlike the Afghani Mujaheddin, could speak Russian, look like Russians, act like Russians. That made them a very dangerous enemy.I think this book, which was written in 1997, didn't pass the test of time. Unfortunately, it has failed to make a meaningful analysis of the conflict and predict the future events. The chip on their shoulders is way too big. I suspect the book was not intended as an analysis, but rather \`war journalism', in which the authors catalog the \`crimes'. Unfortunately, all the crimes are Russian, while the Chechen are romantic freedom fighters, described with warmest feelings.The book has failed to tell the truth, i.e. the fact that with Russian withdrawal from Chechnya and disintegration of the power-base, the thuggish element took the upper hand in Chechnya in 1991-1995 and then again in 1996-1999. These thugs are describes as freedom fighters. The journalistic style is also little weird: sometimes the authors use the first person, sometimes they don't - I assume a difficulty of writing book together. I believe that they were told about many events in the book, rather than witnessed them directly. Much was told by Dudaev, Basayev, Raduyev, and by other Chechen separatist leaders directly to Carlotta Gall. It is known how objective these guys are (or were) - and the book suffers from the same symptoms. I can't recommend it, unless you are a Mujaheddin looking for summer reading."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"The biggest drawback for this title is Gall & de Waal's story ends with the chechen recapture of Grozny in 1996 and the subsequent peace treaty. It fails to follow the story through the Chechen terrorist bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and the Russian military response.So for anyone that is used to sorting out the liberal US media, identifying the authors' allegiance to the Chechen cause is surmountable; knowing that their story is painfully outdated is more important to a prospective buyer."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"I have no comments about the book, even though I I did not like a couple of things. But anyway, the book is very interesting and more thruthfull than any other books I have read about Chechnya."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"This book is a decent introduction for non-specialists who didn't necessarily follow events as they were unfolding a few years ago. However, to its discredit I have to say that it is clearly pro-Chechen, almost to the point of being propaganda in some places. The authors seem to buy into the romantic, historical image of the Chechen freedom fighter, but only emphasize the atrocities committed by the Russians. I suppose that's an occupational hazard faced by war journalists who spend a lot of time covering a conflict among the forces of one side. After all, every point of view has limitiations."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"I found this book an excellent survey of the causes, conduct, and results of the Chechen conflict. The only distracting item is that the authors switch from the third person to the first person,without any transition, when recalling interviews or situations while they were in Chechnya. This book is a must for students of contemporary history of Chechnya, Russia, and the Russian military's ineffectiveness in this conflict. This story is far from over and this book helps one understand how the Russians and the Chechens got to where they are today."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"This is a well-researched book. From media reports, the question often asked is Chechnya a &quot;rogue province of Russia or independent state?&quot; You can form you own opinion by reading this book, among others that cover this conflict.There is a lot of general information about the Chechens and their culture in this book. It paints a picture of who these people are. Chechen history and their relationship with Russia has been mired in conflict for centuries. From the author's point of view, the Chechens have been not treated very well by their mammoth neighbor to the north, and constant intrusions upon them has caused them to suffer because of this oppression. The deportations of Chechens to Kazakstan by Stalin are among other things that fuel the conflict today, and the operation and ramifications of their exile were explained in a full chapter. The cultural norms cited in the book are very interesting. Traditions, dances, swords and feuds, and a fervent desire for autonomy. Beheading takes place, with the head of the enemy shown around the town. This book did appear to sympathize with the Chechens. But that's for each individual to decide.A lot of information is given about the internal Chechen and Russian political, diplomatic, and military events and strategies that occurred during and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The actions of Dudayev and Yeltsin are noted throughout the book."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"The book is a little slow in the begining going back far in the history of the Chechens but to understand what is going on today you need to know what happend awhile ago. Once you get brought up to date the book goes quickly....great writing/reporting."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"Gall and De Waal have done an excellent job of presenting the origins of the conflict and the clash of egos which led to the most recent civil war. An excellent analysis of the war from both sides with little sympathy for either of the combatant factions. One can only feel sympathy for those caught in the middle and anger toward the leaders of both sides who refused to accept a compromise before it was too late."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"When the Soviet Union imploded, the Chechens made a bolt for freedom. Russia has launched two major wars to bring the rebels to heel since then. This action-packed book describes the first campaign, the 1994-96 war, which caused 60,000 fatalities and a host of human rights violations. The second one is continuing and the death toll has already surpassed that of Russia's first, failed campaign. Human rights violations are today in Chechnya as common place as they were in the first campaign. This seminal book therefore remains relevant to trying to understand one of the world's most violent regions.The authors are two journalists who spent almost a year in the killing fields of Chechnya collecting their research material in between dodging the bombs and the bullets. Although the book focuses on the main antagonists of the first war, including Boris Yeltsin and Johkar Dudayev, the late charismatic leader of the Chechens, it also performs several other useful functions. It traces the origins of the enmity between the Russians and the Chechens back to Russia's imperial expansions in the 1830s. Stalin's ruthless deportations of 1944 are also given their due prominence; Stalin believed the Chechens collaborated with the Nazis and deported all of them from the northern Caucasus. Although Khrushchev later allowed them to return, the Chechens have retained a deep loathing of Moscow ever since. There is no love lost here.Moscow is in no financial or moral shape to buy the Chechens off. It has instead opted for a military solution. However, a military solution calls for disciplined assault troops, the type of soldiers who pushed the Nazis back from Moscow to Berlin. This is all the more so when faced with the caliber of resistance the Chechens present. However, Russia's armed forces no longer possesses such men. The army's officers and men are an undisciplined, under-paid hotchpotch of young conscripts and incompetent malcontents, who have no burning desire to die for Mother Russia.The authors draw attention to the human rights violations Russia's conscript army routinely commits. Indiscriminate killings, kidnappings and robberies are daily occurrences. The Russians are more interested in collecting bribes than in fighting the war to its conclusion. This allows the rebels the necessary degree of latitude to pursue their objectives. They operate in shifts, alternating between living as civilians and as partisans. There is no evidence in this book that this unhappy cycle will end in the near future. The Chechens are geared up for the long haul.Stalin, who crushed the Chechens in his own brutal way, was well aware of the Chechens' military prowess. He once famously quipped that a handful of Chechens would be enough to defeat Hitler. When the current war in Chechnya ends, there might only be a handful of them left. But they will have exacted a terrible price on their Russian enemies. Putin cannot resort to Stalin's total terror tactics. He must deal with outside pressures. Although Western concerns about human rights abuses are one of these, there is another which the authors could possibly have spent more time discussing.Chechnya has wider dimensions, chief of which are the region's growing adherence to Islamic fundamentalism and the need of the Russians for a safe southern underbelly. When the Soviets rashly invaded Afghanistan in 1979, they initiated a process that led to the destruction of their own empire. That process is continuing most forcefully in the Caucasus where ethnic and sectarian tensions abound. Russia has few allies in the area. There are the hard-pressed Armenians and the Georgians, who are obsessed with their own problems. And there are not many more.Although Russia must pacify the Caucasus, this book does not offer them much hope. Quite the opposite in fact. The forces of history seem to be on the side of the Islamic fighters in Chechnya and neighboring countries. However unpalatable that may be to some of us, it is the conclusion of this book and of any impartial adjudication of the evidence seeping out from Russia's latest unwinnable war."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"I was thinking of giving this book four stars because it is outdated (the book published in 1998, but probably written before April 1997, as the epilogue indicates), but I can't hold this against the book. All books become outdated at one point.In any event, I've given it five stars largely because of its inside account. I love the fact that the authors were on the ground, seeing things with their own eyes. They also met Dudayev, Basayev, and other critical characters. Their quoting of these people made the book much more enjoyable because they present the views of integral figures (on both the Russian and Chechen sides).It does start out slow with coverage on the history of the Chechens. Some people may not be interested in what a teip is. If you don't care, skip to the parts on the conflict.The book is very lively. It covers almost every drop of a bomb or attack from a first person perspective, though, realistically, it couldn't have all been first person. It is very detailed and the gruesome nature of war is well covered."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus","review":"Shortly after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, the recently formed and tenuously stable Russia became embroiled in a new kind of war; the war in Chechnya.With the breakup of the Soviet Union, a number of former Soviet territories made a grab for independence. Some of the states achieved sovereignty with little bloodshed. Others faced the full might of the Russian political and military fist attempting to prevent succession. Such was the case of Chechnya.Gall and de Waal, both journalists having covered Russia and its provinces for many years, have created an excellent work examining the causes, costs and repercussions of the Chechen War. The book does a superb job of providing historical background on the region and people of Chechnya, their long history of independence, and their many battles with Russian authority.The story then moves to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent instability and lack of effectiveness of the new Russian government. Out of this instability and inefficiency emerged a Chechen move towards independence, an act unacceptable to Moscow. The result was a bloody guerrilla war between the Russian military and the Chechen separatists. Both sides suffered innumerable casualties, and the financial cost of the conflict still ravages the region.The authors rely on innumerable materials garnered from media sources and personal interviews with major players, both Soviet and Chechen, from the conflict. The resulting text is both concise and readable, providing an objective look at the war in Chechnya from the eyes of the Russian political and military leaders as well as the guerrillas and Chechen politicos.

Instead, they are computer generated patterns of Amish quilit patterns. (Low quality generated pictures, at that.) Not even worth the $1.50 I paid for it."},{"Title":"Stone (The) Virgins, A Novel","review":"Yvonne Vera is an artist - a painter with words. The images she conjures, her amazing gifts to the reader, that grace the pages of this incredible novel, come straight from her soul - which is obviously filled with a deep love and compassion for her homeland, Zimbabwe, and its people. In these few pages (less than 200), she manages, through the related experiences, thoughts and emotions of her four main characters, to enlighten the world about the joyous/painful rebirth of Rhodesia into Zimbabwe, and to comment with cutting insight on forces as universal to all of humanity as love, hate, peace, war, kindness, unspeakable cruelty, and selfless, unconditional devotion.She does all of this by utlizing language that is some of the most poetic and beautiful I have ever been blessed to read - her prose is by turns stark and loving, sheltering and illuminating, protective of what is fragile and precious, and unflinchingly revelatory about what is shameful and despicable. Her writing style varies so subtly as the story demands that it sometimes shifts imperceptably between long, graceful, sweeping word-strokes and choppy thought-bursts that could be described as literary pointillism. With some of the incomprehensible violence that occurs in this story, the beauty of Vera's writing is even more of a blessing - without, it would be a great temptation to turn away. That being said, there are also examples within of some of the most wonderful depths of the human spirit.On the first level a story about the effect of the struggle for (and after) Independence on four people - two women, sisters; and two men, one compassionate and one a killing machine - the novel expands in depth to address multiple layers of human emotion and experience. In just one example, Vera's work here delves deeply and inspiringly into the types and purposes of memory - its coexisiting roles that aid us in understanding, protecting us, connecting us with our past and our environment, and healing us.A word of warning, to those who might be tempted to mentally shelve this wondrous novel in \`African fiction' - to do so will do a horrible disservice, not only to this author and her work, but to yourself. This is a novel that can - and should - be experienced by sensitive readers regardless of their ethnic or national background. It speaks to the universality of the human soul - I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Stone (The) Virgins, A Novel","review":"Stone virgins amazingly captured a country destabilized by an internal war that is still haunting the people today. Her depiction of events, balanced plot and rugged characters easily captures the head and mind of a reader.It reminded me of such similar stories like Triple Agent Double Cross,Shake Hands with the Devil,The Sound of Thunder, Disciples of Fortune, Triumph of the Sun. I liked the historical nature of the stories."},{"Title":"Stone (The) Virgins, A Novel","review":"Just outside Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, is the small township of Kezi, where life revolves around the bus that comes in from Bulawayo and the Thandabantu store, where everything can be bought and where the population gathers on the veranda to discuss the events of life. During the liberation struggle the old men are replaced by soldiers - both male and female- that take a rest here. But it becomes apparent in the book that a lot of these soldiers are quite deranged. One such soldier kills a girl, Thenjiwe, and mutilates her sister, Nonceba. After a long stay in the hospital, where she tries to regain her physical well-being and mental health, Nonceba follows the ex-lover Cephas of her dead sister to Bulawayo, where they live as brother and sister, two people forever wounded by the war of independence.When written this way the book seems to hold a lot of promise for a very moving book. However, it took me nearly the whole book to get into the story. Yvonne Vera uses a lot of metaphors in which she couples different senses: she describes sounds in visual terms, tastes she compares to sounds etc and the book is really packed with this. I really had problems understanding what was going on to a point that it actually got me very irritated. However, the end of the book (with the least metaphors) is a very loving description of two hurt people trying to make the most of their lives."},{"Title":"Stone (The) Virgins, A Novel","review":"I found myself lost in some of the imagery in this book. Vera's sytle is indeed lyrical. The problem is that in places, she becomes so entangled in poetic imagery that the point of the scene is lost. I couldn't understand what was happening for pages at a time. Still, she successfully employs this technique throughout most of the book."},{"Title":"Stone (The) Virgins, A Novel","review":"I am a big reader of non-fiction and historical fiction. Other reviewers found this book to be inspiring and poetic. I found it to be depressing and verbose. This entire book could have been written in 6 sentences.

You don't know who the main character is until nearly that far into the book.I read this book for a class on international literature, and the whole class agreed you should stay away from this book.

Christians and non-Christians alike would be very well served to read this book. My only complaint is that it is written with the assumption that you already believe, to an extent, its main thesis: that Christ's teachings were not exclusivist.

I found much clarity in many of Jesus' teachings here that I didn't understand previously. Such as in The Lord's Prayer, \\"Give us this day our daily bread.\\" My thought when I was a child went to giving thanks for food, and I carried that into adult life. Please don't laugh, I just never gave it deeper thought. But Jesus' teachings were always meant to point us towards God-realization and the Swami tells us here that these words mean we are praying that \\"divine grace be reaveled to us now\\".

I had also previously read \\"The Bhagavad Gita\\" according to Gandhi which helped me to understand the other enlightened souls mentioned in the Swami's book."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"Emmet Fox wrote the original and it is truly an amazing book. There's nothing wrong with having to read and re-read each paragraph to get the meaning of a text and it can be very satisfying.

This \\"Sermon on the Mount According to Vedanta is much clearer and more to-the-point, while still delivering a message that shakes your foundation. I don't know anything about Vedanta, but I do know people who do and I admire their dedication to seeking the truth. Is this version better than the original?

The Swami wrote this book with such passion, love, sincerity, and honor for Jesus' life and message. This man of the yoga traditions of Hindu understood Jesus more than the vast majority of people who profess that very name. I do not typically use such blanket statements, but I feel confident to do so in this case.In this little treasure of a book, Christ's message is brought to light in a way that will melt your heart, and alight a love for Christ within you, or will rekindle that fire if it was there and had been lost. This work also offers a beautiful introduction into the teachings of the Hindu faith, albeit an elementary introduction.To help you appreciate this review, I will tell you somewhat of my background. I was brought up in an non-denominational pentecostal movement. Never once in my many years of hearing numerous preachers did I hear Christ taught so lovingly and peacefully. This book resonated with me much more than anything else I had ever heard of the Christ before.I strongly recommend you add this little book to your library.

This book brings Christ closer to me, and in his teachings I get another glimpse of the eternal Truth: that the same God lives in each one of us and in different periods of history, He has told us to realize the Self within self. How do we manage to forget this Oneness of the human family? I consider failing to understand this the reason behind all the evils: the caste-based discrimination in India, the color- based discrimination in the US --all comes from our lack of understanding of this Truth. This book just reaffirms how close we really are, despite our apparently conflicting day-to-day realities. A must read book for all spiritual people seeking the Truth."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"This is a stunning book and reveals the real message behind Christ's words to his closest disciples. It should be helpful to Catholics and Hindus alike."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"Over the course of my life, I have been presented on various occasions with texts described as being 'comparative' of different religions -- usually one religion being stood up against Christianity, the author being a Christian, in an attempt to debunk the teachings of non-Christian faiths. I saw those books as little more than thinly-veiled attempts at propaganda, attempts to spread the Christian message (as the authors saw it) to the 'unsaved, misled masses'.This book, which I originally stumbled across quite by accident, couldn't be further in theme and temperament from that lot -- this is aboslutely the gentlest, most respectful, most loving book that I could imagine on the subject. It makes no attempts at conversion, but in a very scholarly -- yet very readable -- way, takes Christ's Sermon on the Mount (paying special attention to the Beatitudes and the Lord's Prayer) and makes line-by-line comparisons to the ancient teachings of Hinduism.Prabhavananda was a monk of the Ramakrishna Order -- and one of Sri Ramakrishna's most fundamental teachings was the 'oneness of all religions', that, when sincerely believed and practiced, 'all paths lead to the same goal'. This incredible, tender book shows how deeply true his teachings were. Ramakrishna -- a Hindu saint of the 19th century who worshiped God in the form of the Divine Mother, and who experienced ecstatic visions of Christ, Mohammed and Buddha as well -- was one of the most unique, unpretentious, all-encompassing figures in any religion. He embraced them all. Would that we had, in this 'modern, civilized era', when people are still killing each other over the way they each worship God, a teacher so unifying, so true of heart, that could shine the light of wisdom on our folly.Prabhavananda's book brings Ramakrishna's unifying word to modern readers in a wonderful way. I was touched to the core of my soul by this book -- I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who honestly, in their heart, practices ANY faith. It was written to unify, not to divide -- it could be treasured for that alone.For anyone interested in further readings on Sri Ramakrishna, I can recommend THE GOSPEL OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA, or (if this 1000+ page volume is too 'heavy' for you) Lex Hixon's stunning book GREAT SWAN -- MEETINGS WITH RAMAKRISHNA."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"I'm not the kind of person who generally reads these types of books. I gain most of my spiritual solace from Mozart and wilderness hiking. However, this book is surprising. It illuminates Jesus in ways you have never considered and makes you wonder how Christians got things so muddled. This is a refreshing encounter with a subject I usually shun, and you'll never think of Jesus the same way after reading this wonderful book. I highly recommend it to people of all faiths."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"A rare treat. Seldom are philosophies of Hindu and Christian thought combined and made consistent in one text. Typically a short reference in a larger text will make note of similarities, but here we have a line by line explanation of the Sermon, references to Christ's teachings and the Lord's Prayer all in one small book.Interesting to note the similarities and differences as I read, side by side, Martin Luther's Small Catechism and the Sermon on the Mount According to Vedanta. Is Christ the &quot;only son of God?&quot; This book offers examples from Krishna and Arjuna, Buddha and the Torah and modern Avatar's woven into a consistent theme describing the power of devotional worship.

It depended on his audience!Jesus taught the masses according to their capacity. He spoke to them indirectly about spiritual truths through means of parable and metaphor. He was not an elitist. He was a realist. Even the Universe itself is but a parable God is telling us. I digress.Jesus taught those closest to him through both indirect and direct means. \\"When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, the secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables...\\" Mark 4:10-11. NIV.There is the exoteric \\"outside\\" type of Christianity of the masses and then there is the esoteric \\"inside\\" type of Christianity of the few. This is a tendency of all organized religions. But this is a book about the Sermon on the Mount. One type of Christianity is of the letter of the law, of doctrine, an indirect religion. The other a Christianity of the spirit of the law, of direct experience, a gnostic faith. Knowing through personal experience rather than believing through indoctrination. Believers are religious, knowers are spiritual. Jesus was an irreligious man. He was in direct communication with God and so was excommunicated and sentenced to death by the religious believers of his time. Jesus was a revolutionary, a freedom fighter that gave his life for his cause. The cause of spiritual freedom. The truth shall make you free.Fundamentalist Christianity is doctrinal religion. Tribal religion. As I alluded to above every esoteric spiritual tradition has a fundamentalist crowd of outsiders claiming to be insiders. They know doctrine, but they do not know God. \\"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thy eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness...\\" Matthew 6:22-23. KJVThe single eye is the third eye of spiritual intuition that sees the unity of reality. That sees that God is both immanent and transcendent. The evil eye is the eye of duality that separates man from God. Eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is seeing only with our physical eyes. Seeing only appearances, duality. Eating from the Tree of Life is seeing with all of our eyes, physical and spiritual. Seeing that the Kingdom of God is within the holy of holies, the heart within oneself as well as within others. The breath takes one through the gateless gate, the barrier without form, to the garden that leads to the great beyond. Sit quietly and follow your breath. They have eyes but they cannot see for they fail to see that it is not the eyes that see essence. We are awareness.Read \\"The Sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta.\\" It may just open your eyes to a whole new level of understanding. Remember, it does not matter what we believe if we do not have love in our hearts.\\"The Love-Religion has no code or doctrine. Only Love\\".

He sometimes quotes from Christian authors like a Kempis and Boehme, but most often from Ramakrishna and his disciples.This book should be considered a Christian classic. Noone has ever made Christ's immortal discourse easier to understand and live by."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"Many Christians feel that Christianity is very instructive, but stops there. It tells you what to do and what not to do, but does not give satisfactory answers to &quot;Why&quot;s. Here is a book which explains every word of the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot; from basic principles of human existence and purpose. There is a strong fabric of logic based on common undeniable facts of life. Anyone who denounces Christianity as dogmatic should read this book. He is sure to change his views. This book also provides lot of hints on religious life, which can be followed by aspirants of all religions. This is the best commentary on the words of Christ which I have come across.A book which must be read by anyone who wants to understand and follow the way of Christ."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"It's hard for me to believe Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount as presented in Matthew. However, Swami Prabhavananda attempts to reach Christians in writing this book. Essentially he confirms Jesus was a God realized human being. Jesus spoke about the kingdom of heaven, which is within us. If we allow our Real self to emerge, and be led by it, we too can achieve Self realization. The Sermon on the Mount is beyond the grasp of most Christians, as is most of what Jesus tried to convey. This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The sermon on the Mount according to Vedanta","review":"It's always interesting to see the outsider's view of something you have come to understand in one certain way; to see it through fresh eyes can make it new again. This book is a superb example of exactly that. It is probably impossible to come away from this book without a whole series of new insights, no matter how many times you may have read the Sermon on the Mount or how well you think you understand everything in it.This book also serves to make the point that some of these Eastern swamis and gurus are scholars and thinkers of the first order. It really is a shame that our view of them often has been tainted by the antics of the charlatans and hustlers that came west beginning in the 1960s to exploit their own religious traditions for personal gain. If that has been your prejudice, Prabhavananda's book will be something of a revelation.

It is the story and reflections of a noted Harvard sociologist whose family spent a year in the small village of Rousillon in Provence (in the book, he gives it another name to protect the locals' privacy), observing and commenting on village life. It is not a glib, quick laugh -- rather the lively reflection of a thoughtful participant and talented writer. It may be an eye opener to realize just how rural life was not all that long ago in this part of France. There are delightful pictures as well, with scenes that can be recognized by the modern visitor to Rousillon. The end of the book includes the author's reflections on subsequent visits in later years."},{"Title":"Village in the Vaucluse (Harper colophon books)","review":"Laurence Wylie took his wife, and two small children to live in the small Provencal village of Roussillon (which he calls Peyrane) in 1950. It was a world so far removed from the modern romantic perception of Provence as an idyll. It was a world slowly trying to shake off the defeat of the Second World War, which had so closely followed the awful bleeding of the First. Psychologically, many of the citizens were still defeated; they refused to plant fruit trees, which would take 5-6 years to yield a crop, fearing they would be destroyed in the interim by Russia and the United States who would use their country as a battleground in the Third. It was still a time of poverty and want, and the peasants would shoot sparrows for food.Wylie includes only one statistical chart in the entire book- three \\"snap shots\\" of the town's population, by age group, over a hundred year period. In that period, 1851 to 1946, the population declined by almost 50%. There were numerous contributing factors: the rise of industrialization, improved transportation, silkworm diseases, phylloxera, which destroyed the vineyards, decline in the use of ochre in paint and, of course, the First World War. Each had a significant impact on village life that an outsider tends to view as \\"static.\\"There is a scene in the movie \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" in which the Field Commander Strinlikov asked Zhivago why he traveled with his wife and children - was it to reduce suspicion on him, who might be engaged in \\"counter revolutionary\\" activities? Likewise, the presence of Wylie's family was significant in overcoming the prejudice and suspicion of even the most doctrinaire communists - of no small importance in this strongly anti-clerical region. By becoming part of village life, he was able to complete a most effective sociological portrait, covering the major aspects of life, in a charmingly anecdotal manner. First, he locates the village in time and space (I've wondered why he insisted on the \\"ruse\\" of naming Roussillon Peyrane when he identifies it so clearly anyhow, including a map! of the town). Then in following chapters he discusses the phases of a human's life, starting in infancy through schooling, adolescences, marriage, setting up a household, making a living, and concluding with old age. He also focuses on communal activities in \\"getting along with others,\\" the community's relationship with the outside world, the life of the caf&eacute;, community celebrations and organizations.Even with his very best intentions, Wylie is still of the American culture. That is pointedly brought home in an anecdote about the meter reader. First Wylie describes how very little electricity they use - and how low they keep the heat - only to have the meter reader chuckle, shake his head, and proclaim that only the school and the caf&eacute; used more electricity. When I rented a gite in nearby Cabannes in 1989 I thought I was the ultimate conserver of electricity; the gite's owner read the meter, and went \\"oye\\"... yes, it was a case of the Americans who \\"gaspiller\\" - waste - a topical subject now that gas is at $4 a gal in the USA, and China and India see no reason why they cannot have a Western living standard.In the epilogue section Wylie discusses his return visits to \\"Peyrane\\" after ten and twenty-five year periods. Conditions in the village improved far beyond the wildest hopes of the inhabitants of 1950. Perhaps the most stunning revelation to Wylie was realizing that Samuel Beckett had lived quietly in the village as a refuge during the Second World War. During his two years of residence there, no one had told him - it was only when he returned to the USA, and was reading \\"Waiting for Godot\\" and there was a passage about Bonnelly's farm in Roussillon... Later, he was able to confirm this with the residents. Supposedly Beckett was inspired to write the play as he waited for a ride on the N-100, to travel the 3 km up to the village. I too have been visiting Roussillon, frequently, over an almost 20 year period, and have seen the village transformed into a chic holiday destination - they even have installed railings along the top of the ochre cliffs!For the first time visitor, or the \\"recidivist,\\" this is the first book I would recommend for a thorough reading, for the much deeper insights it will give of the life of Provence."},{"Title":"Village in the Vaucluse (Harper colophon books)","review":"This delightful book presents life in a village in Southern France in the 1950's. Author and former Harvard Sociologist Laurence Wylie traveled to Peyrane (Rousillon) France to write this book about the culture and lifestyles of village residents. Readers see how the men worked and relaxed at the local cafe, how women tended their homes (most were housewives), and how adolescents were reminded to have fun before entering adulthood. We also get the views and attitudes of residents, which included loyalty towards their village and annoyance with the national government. The author captures the sights, sounds, and feel of this charming village in a simpler time. This book was written shortly after Nazi occupation ended and as the economic miracle was starting to lift living standards in Europe. Wylie returned later to write a follow-up, and shows the changes wrought by increased prosperity and television.

Kilgore arrives in Midland City and, by happenstance, piques the interest of Dwayne. A confused Dwayne demands a message from Kilgore, who hands over a copy of his novel. Dwayne reads the novel, which purports to be a message from the Creator of the Universe explaining that the reader - in this case Dwayne - is the only individual in the universe with free will. Everyone else is a robot. Dwayne believes the novel to be factual and immediately goes on a violent rampage, severely beating his son, his lover, and nine other people before being taken into custody. While Kilgore is walking the streets of Midland after Dwayne's rampage the narrator of the book approaches Kilgore. The narrator tells Kilgore of his existence, the narrator lets Kilgore be free and to be under his own will."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"The satire in this book is so sharp and so true, it is really incredible how effortless the writing appears.

It was confusing and pointless with no character or plot development."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"If you read Vonnegut you understand how far off into the ether he can fly at times. Since I have only an average mind it is often hard for me to track with him. But he IS a creative rascal and I DO enjoy a dose now and then.Don't read this early in the morning before starting your day. You'll still be confused when you might be out doing something dangerous.I liked it....like all the others."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS was written on the occasion of Vonnegut's fiftieth birthday. He chose this auspicious occasion to revisit the life of one of his characters who appeared in earlier novels--Kilgore Trout, an obscure science fiction writer, whom Vonnegut now allows to become rich and famous, despite Trout's total lack of interest in fame and fortune. Vonnegut's beautiful phrases are few and far between. His ironic truths are delivered in short, straightforward sentences--a sometimes gentle, sometimes not so gentle confrontation. Vonnegut is in a class by himself. Unlike other satirists, he shows a genuine affection for his characters, reflecting what must be a great love for the human race--despite its foibles that he so expertly identifies. His black comedy is rendered with a sensitivity that elicits tender feelings and fondness for his characters, who are neither heroes nor villains, but people like ourselves who have stubbed their toes tripping through life. His comic irreverence always serves to let us know ourselves better, and he leaves no sacred cow unsullied. About the discovery of America in 1492, he says, \\"Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them.\\" BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is among Vonnegut's finest writings, something of a summary of his first fifty years of experience as a human being."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"You never forget your first Vonnegut, and this was mine. (Not this edition, I'm thinking of 30 years ago.) I had never seen anything like it: the various measurements, the line drawings, and Kilgore Trout. Is it about pollution and the end of resources? Our obsession with sex? The contemplations of an omniscient narrator? The meaning of categories like \\"science fiction\\" and \\"pornography\\"? Or just another of his wacky stories that turns out to be about what he did and saw in Vietnam and what it did to his later life in New York?I still love this story. This edition is slick and slender, I remember a bigger book.Delivery took longer than usual from Amazon."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I first read this book in high school, and it was truly my gateway to discovering Vonnegut, who would become my favorite author. Since then, I have picked it up time and time again whenever I feel particularly upset with the state of the world.I can honestly say that, in my opinion, this is one of his best works. The satire in this book is so sharp and so true, it is really incredible how effortless the writing appears. It says a lot about a book and the way the author saw the world, when you can pick it up almost 40 years after it was written and still relate to most of the material as if it were written yesterday.Breakfast of Champions is precisely that type of book. Both hilarious and morose because it's true, Vonegut's masterpiece is a little too down-to-Earth for comfort, as he shamelessly insults the American (and Earthly) way of life. I would recommend this to anyone already familiar with Vonnegut as well as anyone else who enjoys reading satire that takes society and shows the reader its every little flaw. Vonnegut was a genius!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Thanks to Kindle, I am rediscovering Kurt Vonnegut. I used to devour any of his writing that came my way, but it has been 30 years since I have read any of his titles. So it is a great joy to rediscover an author with my kindle.\\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is a popular Vonnegut title, but not usually the favorite of readers, it does not follow most writing conventions. Reading this title is sort of like playing dodgeball. The ideas come careening from all directions, and the reader is not able to prepare for what is in store.Vonnegut does not pull any punched in this book. It is a revealing look at human nature, and the society that we live in. The language and ideas may pose some problems for the modern reader, even though the book is not that old.\\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is not heavy on plot, in fact most of the action is revealed early on. The fun is in how he gets there. What he does not reveal, and what most people find hard to follow is that this is a story by \\"The creator of the universe\\" who makes the characters and then lets them roam in the world of his creation. I will not give away the ending, I am not here to provide any spoilers. The creator shows up in the story and is integral in the ending. This is not a technique that can be pulled off by a lesser writer.The book is sprinkled with Vonnegut's whimsical drawings, and this adds greatly to the enjoyment of the text.Put on your seatbelt, you are in for one heck of a ride."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I've seen a lot of luke warm and downright negative responses so I had to add my own review. Let me just say. . .you have to \\"get it.\\" If you do not appreciate sarcasm, satire, and brutal honestey then you don't need to pick up a Vonnegut book. Admittedly they are not for everyone, but for those of us who find ourselves delighted with Vonnegut's simple, in your face style his books become like potato chips; you can never just have one."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Reading a plot summary of this book might tell you what to expect, but Breakfast of Champions isn't worth reading for the plot. Read this book if you have enjoyed Slaugheterhouse-Five and Cat's Cradle and you want to go deeper into Vonnegut's ideas.The themes that dominate some of Vonnegut's other works -- religion, war, the interconnectedness of humanity -- are a backdrop here for exploration of the relationship of an author to his subject. Vonnegut is the creator of the narrator-character, who is the creator of Kilgore Trout (the \\"eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe\\"), who is in a sense the creator of Dwayne Hoover.This theme is the context for one of Vonnegut's constant preoccupations, the question of free will vs. determinism (or \\"machinery\\"). This question is treated very ambiguously in Breakfast of Champions. Vonnegut's meaning is obscured by layers of satire. The narrator nakedly and repeatedly espouses the view that people are just machines, but this view is undermined at the end through the reader's reaction to Dwayne Hoover's insane rampage. And in the Epilogue, when Trout meets the narrator, the narrator describes in detail his machine-like reflexes to danger, and tells Trout exactly what will happen to him in the future, but he also \\"frees\\" Trout and gives him a symbolic apple -- a common representation of the beginning of free will. I think the best triangulation of his true position is the explanation of the ridiculous art by Rabo Karabedian, \\"an unwavering band of light\\" within a machine-body that is a slave to determinism, but Karabedian himself is one of the most ridiculed characters in a ridiculous cast. No matter what conclusion you draw from these scenes, the determinism-free will issue is brilliantly connected to Vonnegut's explanation of various evils of modern American life (or is it really evil, if it's just \\"bad chemicals\\"?).Breakfast of Champions is Vonnegut's meta-novel. Comprehension of it is enriched by knowledge of Vonnegut's other interconnected works (plenty of parallels to \\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\\"), and it's not really the place to start in the Vonnegut universe. But there is a wealth of satire and symbolism here to unpack, hidden within a funny and fast-moving story."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"It is not popular art, so it isn't meant to appeal to everyone. It didn't paricularaly speak to me, which doesn't make it bad art, but it doesn't make it good art either. It really seems (by Vonnegut's outright admission) to be written largely for the author's own benefit. The problem with believing that is you're never quite sure when to take Vonnegut at face value. That is a lot of the fun of Vonnegut; reading his books puts you into a state of uncertainty that is unfamiliar and stimulating - it's also disquieting.Vonnegut has said this isn't one of his favorite novels he wrote. It isn't one of my favorite Vonnegut novels either. That said, it gives you an interesting glimpse into the mind of a disturbed genius."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I was a bookworm since I learned how to read books at 7. I read Vonnegut's \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" the first time when I was still a teen (in Polish translation) and this book was probably the most astonishing I ever read in my life. Funny (but also bitter), interesting, easy to read, even had some author pictures, sometimes strangely related to the text. But on the other hand, this book really make you think - about the world, about our civilization and where it is heading, about the people and their strange ways, about America.When I first read the book I was still in communistic Poland, so I saw some of the problems the author was talking about as a part of the western civilization. Now after I read it again, I see so much mild critique of excesses of America's life. I live in America ~ 10 years so it is normal that for me America would be always something different than my home country or Europe. I am amazed that Vonnegut still can look at America from the position of the external observer, who still can see some absurdity in many aspects of life.In spite of his critique of the world, country and society Vonnegut loves people, he loves them with all their weakness and defects. His books have great educational value."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Every time I read this book, I find something new. It is very funny and not necessarily as grim as some people seem to find it. The book to me seems a comic meditation on being an animal in a world of animals and being just smart enough to know that you don't like your culture (American/Western) and thus have no culture at all to provide you with comfort as you live in such an unjust and brutal world."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is one of Vonnegut's more light-hearted pieces. However, the book does have serious comments on society, life, and the interaction of people. The story follows two characters: Mr. Trout, a science fiction writer; and a car salesman by the name of Mr. Hoover. Kilgore Trout has been summoned by Elliot Rosewater (who is also the main character in Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;) to be the guest of honor at an arts festival. Quite suprised that anyone even knows he exists, Mr. trout sets off across the country to attend the event. Along the way, Vonnegut treats the reader to a variety of Trout's short story ideas (most of which sound like either bad, or really obscure science fiction). At the same time, the story follows Wayne Hoover's dysfunctional sturggle to make it through life as an automobile salesman. The story focuses both men as they progress towards, and eventually converge on the arts festival. Many characters that appear in this novel also appear in other Vonnegut novels, making it an excellent introduction to Kurt Vonnegut's work.Among the many minor (or mini) themes that Vonnegut offers the reader throughout the book, a major one emerges. He seems to say that people should be careful of what they say, or write, because we effect other is ways that we can't even imagine (both negativelly and possitivelly). Often times we are, and remain, unaware of the consequences of our actions.There is also another aspect of the novel that is noteworthy: The illustrations. Mr. Vonnegut weaves rather simple drawing into the actual text of the story (often for a humorous effect). These illustrations often take the place of verbal descriptions. For the first hundred pages, or so, this style is interesting. However, after that it grows old, and begins to seem like an easy way to avoid describing objects. This, however, is my only complaint concerning the book. I would recomend the novel to any Kurt Vonnegut fan. I would also recomend this as an introduction to Mr. Vonnegut's work, or to a person who loves humorous stories."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book should be read for several reasons:First, it is an important lesson in American history. In the form of a fictional town, Vonnegut creates a brilliant (read \\"entertaining\\") satire of American life. With great agility he addresses race, sexuality, gender, freedom, nature, and much more. Although still largely applicable, this satire is dated (1972).Second, Vonnegut experiments with form; the narration occurs as an acummulation of loosely connected details. This makes the book fast and fun to read--we skip from one interesting thought to the next, and before we know it, a plot develops. The entire story is littered with profound ideas about life and art; Vonnegut is refreshingly honest and articulate concerning the great mysteries, including life's meaning and minimal art.Third, the author demonstrates his drawing talent (albeit it limited), with almost every other page hosting a small doodle. While these pictures add little to the content, it is apparent that Vonnegut took great satisfaction in making a text complete with illustrations. For this reason, I call it art.Fourth, this book might actually encourage you to measure your genitals. (So as to compare yourself with Dwayne, Kilgore, and the rest of the characters.) And, as a bonus, the author reveals his own measurements. In fairness, women are also reduced to their bust/waist/hips measurements."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is quite possibly the best Vonnegut has ever written. He is already my favorite author, but this is simply stunning. However, this book is not a good first if you are just getting into Vonnegut. The style that makes it as good as it is can be hard to digest for people not used to Vonnegut.This novel, in more ways than one, is a work of art. Vonnegut's novels are like a giant collage. He takes a bunch of meaningless junk, adds some humor, and puts it together to build a coherent picture that tells a powerful story. (Anyone who thinks penis sizes isn't meaningless junk cannot appreciate this book).All in all, an excellent story, full of witty drawings by Vonnegut himself, that is well worth the time and money."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Firstly, no one here is trying to insult one another's intelligence. We're all friends. But I have to say, I believe people who have been posting that Vonnegut is \\"racist\\" in this book have seriously not delved the slightest bit into what this man is trying to get across. It seems these people believe that any use of the word \\"nigger\\" in a novel promots racism. This man is telling a story the way he choses to tell it, you cannot decide his writing reflects his own personal beliefs. But all that aside, Vonnegut is using his quick, out of the blue phrases to breakdown what seems so complex in society today, hes anti-philosophical, not trying to elaborate into the wild blue yonder, but simplfy things into human, man to man terms. His writings in this book are often an attempt to put racisim in a light that seems ignorant, and nonsensical, which is exactly what racism is! Please try and seem, this is one of the greatest authors of our time, and I really enjoyed this book. Hope you do too"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions reads as a fresh work, considering today's political climate. It is a very anti-American novel and, depending how you voted in the last election, you will either love it or hate it. The plot concerns a science fiction author, Kilgore Trout (a pun on real-life author Theodore Sturgeon), and a car dealer named Dwayne Hoover. Hoover is going out of his mind and - after reading one of Trout's books - comes to believe that he is the only person in the world who isn't a robot.This is an experimental novel. Vonnegut writes himself into the book and fills it with crude illustrations. It is funny, biased, and thought-provoking look on American society. It doesn't have a traditional \\"beginning, middle, and end.\\" Vonnegut expressly states that he disdains traditional fiction writing because it makes people believe that they should act like characters in books. It is difficult to imagine agreeing with Breakfast of Champions one-hundred-percent, but it will give you plenty to think about."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is the third Vonnegut I have read and I still can't figure out if I like the guy or not.It is a story(or is it?) about two insane lunatics who eventually cross paths. One of these men is a science fiction writer named Kilgore Trout who can only get his work published as filler for pornography magazines. The other is a wealthy widower who goes on a rampage because of Trout at the end of the story. I'm not giving anything away by telling you this because Vonnegut tells you himself at the begining of the book.The book is quick and simple to read, vulgar and laugh-out-loud funny. It features crude drawings by Vonnegut and introduces many of its male characters by revealing the length and width of their penises. It certainly is entertaining in a Farlly brothers kind of way but is it literature as many regard it? I guess it could be a judgement on our culture but I certainly don't think he deserves the same respect as Thomas Hardy or Mark Twain. His books really don't stay with me like Hardy's or Twain's do. The only time I really recall them is when I see them sitting on my book shelf and think,"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"If you're an advit Vonnegut reader you know damn well who Kilgoure Trout. So it's no suprise you want to find a little bit more about him. This book is the definitive Kilgoure Trout book I believe, and has the same effect on this character that the Enacapatian Proclamantion would have had on Kunto Kenta. Vonnegut frees his character in this book, Which I found to be something no other author could pull off.Plus Bill, Trout's bird is quite possibly the greatest Bird in a book sense Robinson Crusoe's Parrot.It's worth your time - if not for the cross dressing Harry LaSabre alone.* &#60;--- and you will never look at that the same."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"i thought that this book was one of the best books i had ever read. i loved how the book used so many different subjects such as: Flamingos, gangs, aliens, Chicken, and insanity to keep you on your toes when you where reading. this book was ment to entertain and i think that it did a very nice job of doing that."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I heard an anecdote about how, just after publication of this book, he received a fan letter from a 12 year old girl who asked him not to commit suicide. The thing is, he hadn't told anyone he'd be thinking about just that! Weird, huh? Or is that a testament to the strength and clarity of Vonnegut's themes? The saddest part is in the last few paragraphs. You can hear the author saying them to the reader, almost...It made ME cry anyway, but it was sort of a good thing."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Of all the writers of this crazy age Vonnegut stands alone for the North Americans, in my opinion. There's just so much inside this novel that any attempt at deconstruction would only be futile. Vonnegut looks like Einstein's crazy long-lost brother and his novels are like some insane Schrodinger wave equation that finds a different place to collapse depending on the reader's state of mind.What you take from this trip depends on what's inside your head; I always find reading this leaves me feeling like the world has tilted slightly. Vonnegut could almost be a reincarnated Zen master weaving modern koans for the disillusioned age."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"An entertaining book but I found that it drifted a bit towards the end. I have read two other Vonnegut books and found Breakfast of Champions the weakest of the three. What I found annoying was the author introducing himself into the book in the last third of the story. It just seemed to be attention getting and have no real benefit to the story itself."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I am a huge Vonnegut fan. I have read them all. This was one of the last that I read, and by far my least favorite. I barely got through it. DO NOT start reading Vonnegut with this book. Start with Slaughterhouse Five or something else, and save Cat's Cradle for last....."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I'm 35, have been working with books for well over a decade, and had never read a Vonnegut book 'til now. Needless to say, I've been very much aware of the man. A high percentile of co-workers and customers and friends through the years have sworn by Vonnegut. Skims every so often failed to lure me in, but a copy of \\"BoC\\" fell into my hands recently, so I thought, okay, let's see what this guy is about already.I think I might have been more into it had I read it when I was younger, which is when people usually begin their acquaintanceship with his books. At this point, however, there's nothing remotely revelatory in his satire. It's all rather savagely caustic, and rightly so on most counts. But the foibles of America and Americans is (as it was then) the most obvious of targets, and I don't read books in order to knowingly nod my head in agreement. For one who isn't all the way through the looking-glass, so to speak, this book is perhaps to be recommended. If you've already been caught up and learned to observe the illusory spectacles of the hyper-capitalist world for what they are, it's not a particularly enlightening perusal of 300 pages.Or really, 200 pages, since so much space is needlessly wasted with deliberately juvenile drawings which, from my perspective, are far more irritating than amusing. Where Vonnegut's infusion of high comedy is concerned, I admit to laughing out loud once - it was at the description of one of Kilgore Trout's plot synopses - but only that once. The \\"and so on\\"s and other repetitive devices just don't strike me as terribly witty. The elementary-school presentations of adult subjects made me feel as if I was reading a prose version of Shel Silverstein. Taking this in, along with the cavalier vulgarity which is as much a unifying theme as anything actually useful in the writing, leaves one with the sense that Vonnegut may have been a little too irreverent for his own good.The cheap metaphysics thrown in toward the end with Vonnegut inserting himself into the \\"plot\\" is moderately compelling - the rumination on free will (or, if he's truly as cynical as it would appear, the lack thereof) is about as clear a true theme as there is to be found here amongst all the bilious contempt heaved forth from his pen - but the book is so thoroughly muddled and glibly haphazard (there are so many characters who appear briefly or float peripherally around Trout and Dwayne Hoover that it makes you wonder if Vonnegut had any idea while he was writing if they were going to reappear later in the book or not) that it seems sort of out of place by that point to suggest there is any serious agenda in mind other than to effectively offend the mindset of anything and anyone he apparently considers to be typically American. And while that kind of thing can elicit more than a few knowing grins, mostly it's just kind of boring. Vonnegut doesn't do a whole lot more here to create a air of substance than the various elements of society that he's too busy idly skewering like a Mad magazine staffer. Frankly, he seems a little too proud of his artlessness to convincingly create the effect that he's in fact exploring deep literary or philosophical concerns. I do believe Vonnegut very much had intentions of being a serious author, but he works so hard to get in his own way of being taken seriously that one is more likely to be left with a different impression instead.So no, I wasn't overly impressed. I might give him another shot but I'm not in any hurry."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I'll start by letting you know that I read the book about ten years ago. I was looking through my libraries meager selections of books on CD and happened to see this, and having always been a fan of Kurt V. I decided to give it another go.Have you ever heard Stanley Tucci act? No, I guess you mostly see him act, if you even know who he is. While he reads this book, it seems like just that: reading. I have listened to many books and most of the time the reader is a skilled storyteller. Stanley, I am sorry to say, is not. He gives no difference to any of the characters in the book; they all sound just like him talking. This was not my favorite Vonnegut book to begin with and Tucci's voice did not make it any better.This novel reminds me of life as a train wreck. One can see Kurt at the throttle of his locomotive, plowing over all the characters while heading towards its ultimate derailment at the end of the book. I do not know his personal situation at the time of writing, but I'm guessing that he was drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts. I am surprised he didn't kill himself after sobering up a few years later and finally reading this, because he obviously did not proof it.Vonnegut has stated that this is one of his least favorite books. So, if you have to read them all than go ahead. At the very least, it will give you insight into the mind of a genius."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"My favorite part about this book are the drawing by Vonnegut that you find through out the book. \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is classic Vonnegut and with the exception of the drawings, is a great lismus test for reads who are curious with whether or not they will like Vonnegut. However, do NOT watch the movie as it is terrible. Enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book rocked my world. Never before have I been forced to think about contemporary American culture in the way Vonnegut outlines in this biting social criticism."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In sort of a creative release, Vonnegut creates one of the strangest and most unique novels I've read. It takes a bit of knowledge into Vonnegut's style, but if you've liked other works by Vonnegut, don't miss Breakfast of Champions."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is Vonnegut for people who hate Vonnegut. It's ironic, it's witty, it's fourth dimensional, it pushes the literary medium further than ever, but most of all: it's funny. The little details are fantastic, you want to say, &quot;you can't make this stuff up.&quot; Vonnegut's alter ego Kilgore Trout, the anti-social science fiction writer for porno magazines, gets into all sorts of wacky adventures on his way to a convention. The synopsises of Kilgore's stories are so clever and satirical you almost wish they were novels too! Buy it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut is just amazing with his almost naive humor and storytelling. For me, Breakfast was thoroughly stimulating and thought provoking but not to the point of where I was lost (the book renders an intellectual but very comical voice). Vonnegut's amazing style made me a fan with Slaugherhouse-five which completely changed my perspective on the world with the novel's exploration of...well everything that is human and not. But back to the Breakfast... Vonnegut is very creative with writing himself into the story. He takes such a real voice when dealing with his characters and their lives which are really representative of our own. For anyone looking to break the confinds of conventional life, Vonnegut is the way to go."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Although I found this novel extremely funny, I had to keep asking myself what it was about. Maybe I am just too dense to get it or I over-analized it. Probably the first. In any case, if the rest of Vonneguts novels are as funny as BOC, I might take a look at them too. I'll make sure to have an interpreter on hand."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is an excellent book. It runs a close second to his inspired &quot;Cat's Cradle.&quot; The book focuses on a used car salesman slowly going mad, Kilgore Trout, and Vonnegut himself.

JW"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"It is incredible. As you are faced with tragic, disturbed, and ignorant characters, you must realize that there are people like this in the world. All minds do not work alike, and all minds will find something different in Vonnegut's prose. You can pick it up one day and laugh, another and feel horrible about human nature, another and be baffled, or even just shake your head at its cleverness. However you see it, Kurt does it right. I haven't read this for years, but it is a novel that will always be a five-starer for me.

But from what I read, this book is little more than garbage. I read &quot;Cats Cradle&quot; and enjoyed it. I didn't agree with everything in it but it was very clever and subtle. This on the other hand, has no subtlety. It reads like the lyrics to a rage against the machine song. Just pure liberal ranting about how everything established in America is wrong. Also, his drawings seem like a cop out, an excuse not to describe something. If you want to read good satire, read Heller, or John Kennedy Toole. This book is a lemon."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know.

His writing is so pretentious, self-referential, and nihilistic that you can't help but despise Vonnegut personally and despise even more the intellectuals and professors who praise him religiously.Breakfast of Champions is no different than the rest of his work. He randomly inserts inane facts to be funny, like the size of male characters' organs once he introduces them. These can come at any moment, so you have to be prepared for them. The book is extremely vulgar in that the obscenities have no redeeming value. There is no genuine emotion behind them.The plot? There is none that makes any sense. Furthermore, Vonnegut partakes in America bashing for the first 10 pages and comes across as a Communist, which made me nearly put the book down, but I muscled through the rest of it on a long airplane ride.Completely unenjoyable. No redeeming value. One of the worst books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This review is for the audio CD version of the novel. I read the book for the first time 20+ years ago. At the time, we lived in a different world. As a teenager, I thought Vonnegut was cool, and I devoured this novel. 20+ years later, I can no longer stomach it. Back when it was hip to bash American and all it stands for, this book seemed important. I can see now that it is not. Don't bother reading this."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I was sooooooo dissapointed since I am a big fan of Vonnegut's and love his writing style (except in this book), not to mention my favorite character Kilgore Trout. I read some of the reviews and decided to ignore the negative ones since there is so many people out there who clearly miss Vonnegut's point. It is racist, sexist and towards the end he just rambles on pointlessly about things ... that have nothing to do with what he is talking about. I am used to being shocked by Vonnegut but this was too much. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it is a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"One thing about the author is, he loves the &quot;n-word&quot; and he hates blacks. I never could understand how people who call themselves imaginative creators take such pride in alienating select audiences. Don't you want people to buy the darn book??? You effectively killed your black audience, Kurt. Now, I'm a smart man with a high tolerance for stupidity and wacked opinions and am often able to find art in the sublime. From another black man's promptings, I bought the book and read it. I was disgusted. No doubt, Quentin Tarrantino is clammoring for the rights to make the film.

It stars Bruce Willis as the wacky Dwane Hoover. the movie to me was OK"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions was a book by Kurt Vonnegut.That's really all I have to say about the book to make it what it is. It's impolite, but acceptable. It was meant to be both at the same time, and that's what it was. It was everywhere but on the page. There wasn't for one second when I was reading that book that I thought of it as a book. I thought of it as an idea, or a million different ideas, which I believe is the way that the book was meant to be taken. A different view for every subject that has a view.What lots of people seem to say about this book is that it is a symbol for something. A story about the tragedies of war, of mental illness, about how life can change you, about coincidence. People try and find meaning in this book. They call it literature, and give it importance, and give it fancy titles and symbolism that is everything they think it is, that they want it to be, much like the lives of people in Midland City.I believe this book was intended for everyone to read, if not for everyone to understand. It gives perspectives that only someone like Kurt Vonnegut would think of. That being, no one else.The titles 'Breakfast of Champions' and 'Goodbye, Blue Monday' both fit the story if you read it. Seemingly interesting as well, to those who don't know the story behind it. Part of which is what made me pick it up.The way that Kurt puts himself in his books to further the story is what gives them his personal style, and which is particularly evident in this novel of his. He isn't afraid to stray from the conventions of rules of grammar, or typical book structure. A drawing here and there to further illustrate the point gives it not meaning but voice.Conventions aside; This story, this book, this philosophy gives thought, gives a closer look to aspects of daily life which most don't think about. And for those who aren't trying to look to deep into the pages, but just looking for something to pass the time, it's still a good read."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's novel Breakfast of Champions is a satirical compilation of his many harsh opinions and critiques of American society including sex, drugs, mental illness, and the nation in general. This novel should be read by anyone from age 16 to above who enjoy satire, humor, and a light, easy read. The title, as Vonnegut takes extra time explaining, has nothing to do with the cereal and is not affiliated in any way with General Mills. After reading the novel, it is not clear as to why he chose this as the title. It could be that the slogan \\"breakfast of champions\\" is a widely popularized phrase in America, or that the novel is simply the breakfast of champions because the reader will gain so much insight to the faults of American society.The most interesting aspects of the book were the illustrations and the side comments Vonnegut inserted for many random things. The illustrations made the book a fun, easy read. Vonnegut put illustrations in this novel to give hints as to how he saw the world, which is very abstract and humorous. The illustrations are anything from a sign on the side of the street, to a drawing of a bug form of a beetle and the car form of a beetle. His brief explanations of random events and items were at first confusing, but then greatly appreciated.The most exciting part of the book was the ending because the whole book led up to and gave hints to what was going to happen in the end. Throughout the novel, the reader knows that Dwayne Hoover is going to go insane and hurt a bunch of people. It was hilarious to actually read about it, because of his state of mind during the time.Vonnegut is known for his satirical humor. This novel makes the reader think about aspects of American life which he questions, and the reader can formulate their own opinions with consideration of his. Also, Vonnegut pokes fun at historical events around the world, however serious they may be. The only thing that I did not like about the novel was how Vonnegut jumps around from character to character at the most random times. It made if confusing and hard to follow. Also, Vonnegut could have gone without giving away the ending of the novel at the beginning."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This was my first experience of Vonnegut. After a few pages I was thinking he was a bit...Um...\\"Brain Damaged\\". By the time I got to page 50, I saw he was a genius. He is a master at satire. One of the few books I could read over and over again."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I love this book. Others have said a lot more, but I simply think everyone should read this book.

The binding was broken and the cover was attached, but dangling. The cover was also slightly soiled and some of the pages fragile, but it's an acceptable condition."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"There were multiple times that I broke out in hysterical laughter with this book. There were just a few times that I experienced intense feelings of 'pissed off.' And so on. This book was highly enjoyable and gave an incredibly satirical look at Western culture (Mainly the US). Vonnegut is witty, rye, matter-of-fact. The detached perspective of the author included in this book gives a fresh meaning to the subjects he is writing about, and his use of words is entrancing in a way that lets the reader know that this book was written to show the problems and issues that are so prevalent in America. He even has the most descriptive ways to explain such atrocities. Vonnegut tackles the issues of now in a painful way, showing us how the truth about ourselves can be just as disgusting as the Creator of the Universe saw things in his own book. In a way, it shows the reader the relationship of author/character is a story. That with fiction, anything is possible, and including some of real life into it, makes the reader think more in depth about the way they live their life.My new favorite Vonnegut book. Even ahead of Galapagos, and Hocus Pocus!ETC."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Although I do not share many aspects of Mr. Vonnegut's view of life, I can still appreciate how well he expresses it. This novel, ostensibly about the fateful encounter between an obscure sci-fi writer and a car salesman who is slowly going insane after reading one of his stories, is really about life and politics according to Kurt Vonnegut. Often transparently so. Using minimalistic and hilariously bad doodles the author relates his view of humans as creatures largely determined by genetic and environmental factors (Hitler, according to this book, was \\"full of bad chemicals,\\" for instance) and his view of politics and society as the tyranny of these influences exerted through systemic means. There is, of course, no organized expression of this thesis, and this ties into my chief criticism of the work: it is rambling. Remarkably so. The narrative is a very chain that just barely binds together the various observations made by the author. His presentation is as irreverent as much of the content. And yet, this work is still very cutting, and the almost child-like explanations of everything from racism to the cold war range from silly to profound. I think, to Mr. Vonnegut's credit, that, as a whole, it is closer to the profound side of things than the silly side, and that's why I've rated it fairly highly. I think the author is wrong on a lot of things, and he could have expressed his views in a more organized fashion without robbing this work of its entertainment value, but there are too many pearls here to dismiss this book. The characters are well-drawn but not particularly deep: par the course for the genre of satire. I recommend this book for what it does right. Yet understanding where Vonnegut goes wrong can be a worthwhile process as well, because, no matter what he may be, he is never boorish or typical in his thinking."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is classic Vonnegut. It is fun to read and has great satire. It isn't very grabbing as some other stories are and there is not much plot but it is still a great read."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I\`ve read a lot of these Amazon reviews, and I find myself nodding in agreement with most readers' comments, but this Breakfast phenomenon is something I just can't fathom. There\`s nothing funny at all in this book. Well, no, I smirked once, I'll admit - when Karabekian made the &quot;outboard motor&quot; comment - but THAT WAS IT. The Egyptian Book of the Dead delivers more humor than you'll find here. HOW CAN THERE EXIST A LESS HUMOROUS BOOK? And yet 'readers' find it &quot;hilarious.&quot; Man, I gotta wonder.... Kurt Vonnegut did, after all, start his career as a publicity man...Dwayne Hoover, Kilgore Trout, and the rest of the characters are like computer generated zombies. Vonnegut feeds us a philosophical line about how he doesn't want to glorify his characters because he thinks that people act out the roles they find in books, and he doesn't want to be responsible for a lot of misguided heroics. Fair enough, but what he gives us instead is just a lot of insipid meandering. If he wanted NOT to influence anyone, he could have simply done the world a favor and not written the book.The book raises a few stale philosophical issues, I'll grant it that, but as far as I can make out the story only serves to obfuscate what Vonnegut is trying to say. But of course, a straightforward essay (a page or two of lucid writing would suffice to express the ideas that merits interest in this novel) wouldn't offer much potential for the media-hype treatment that Vonnegut specializes in."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Goodbye Blue Monday or Breakfast of Champions outrageously funny, provocatively clever, and just an all around pleasant page-turner. The spiritual journey that Mr. Vonnegut takes us on is poignantly authentic, while at the same time ribaldly funny. Mr. Vonnegut, on the precipice of suicide (real or virtual), engages in a protracted orgy of cathartic blood-letting, a purging of the flotsam and jetsam of what passes for culture in this disneyland of a country of ours, that has collected in the drain pan of his consciousness. It's an Irish wake on acid, and along the way Mr. Vonnegut experiences an unexpected epiphany (real or virtual) in the person of one of his creations, the painter Rabo Karabekian. Karabekian teaches Mr. Vonnegut that Homo sapiens do in fact possess some sanctity in the guise of our awareness, expressed by Karabekian in his painting, &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony,&quot; as &quot;an unwavering band of light.&quot; Unwavering in the sense that, even with all of the cockymamied crapshoot contretemps that constitutes life on this planet, we remain sentient. In the process of defending his painting in a Holiday Inn cocktail lounge to some of the outraged citizens of Midland City, which has purchased the painting for an ridiculously exorbitant sum, Karabekian saves Mr. Vonnegut's life. Along the way we are treated to Mr. Vonnegut's drawings of some ofthe offal that that passes for American culture that he's trying empty his head of. This novel is anything but--it's a clarion call for sanity in an increasingly insane world. We should listen."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS, Vonnegut eventually brings three characters to a climactic event in a bar. These characters are Kilgore Trout, a lonely and unsuccessful science fiction writer who has only one reader; Dwayne Hoover, a bipolar money-making small businessman whose wife committed suicide and whose son is a disappointment (gay); and Philboyd Studge, the supposed creator of BoC, who enters the novel and establishes authorial connections to Trout and personal connections to Hoover. The novel is better in summation than execution. So it goes.Vonnegut uses cartoonish characters in BoC. Never, in other words, does he show (or apparently want to show) the authorial command and flourish that make a character live momentarily on the page. Instead, what Vonnegut does is to drop a fact here or there to endow Trout, Hoover, and Studge with emotional problems. But what's he's mostly interested in doing is exploring the context in which these problems exist. For many readers, such explorations may be darkly funny. But if you don't get the humor... well, BoC reads like an extremely long short book (only 56,449 words, according to Amazon.) So it goes.Let's see how this works. Trout, a total loner and loser, is described as the author of more than 100 science fiction novels. These are unpublished, unless they have been picked up by pornographers, who use them to bulk up and legitimize their products. By my count, Vonnegut provides capsule reviews of 16 of these novels in BoC, which show, without exception, that Trout has weird, but not very insightful, ideas. So, why does Vonnegut give so much space to Trout's pathetic productivity and loneliness? Several times in BoC, he observes that ideas are tools for joining groups, not for examining reality. The isolated Trout, in other words, has got everything wrong. No wonder he's a loser. So it goes.Meanwhile, the bipolar Hoover has done everything right in his business and career. But his family life is an angry tragedy. So what's Vonnegut interested in? He primarily wants to show Hoover, who is ready to snap, doing this and that in the context of tacky 1960's mass culture. The focus, in other words, is on the world that Hoover, and those with his sensibility, has produced. IMO, Hoover is mostly a way to whine about Rotarian culture. So it goes.The odd thing is that the creator of this review eventually became involved in the stories of Trout and Hoover, even though these characters are cartoons. But then Vonnegut allows Studge to insinuate the narrative, putting him in a bar where the crazy Hoover is drinking. Later, he has an exchange with Trout. Why does Vonnegut do this? Well, literary fashion, I suppose. But Studge, who is distant and manipulative, is the sort who would cruelly torment Trout. And he has, like Hoover, a female suicide in his background. One might argue that this gives depth and dramatic force to the novel. But Studge is also another cartoon, who enters the narrative very late and just after Trout and Hoover acquire some heft. Unfortunately, they can't carry his sly and empty presence and Studge knocks the entire narrative back to cartoon status. The upshot: the arbitrary violence at the end of BoC loses its power to shock and clarify, unlike the American bombing of Dresden at the end of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. So it goes.One final point: Throughout BoC, Studge includes childish drawings, which show, for example, what a cow looked like... what an apple looked like. I'm not really sure; but I think the narration of this novel occurs in the future and after an environmental disaster has destroyed all but a few species. Supposedly, these illustrations are meant for an audience that is curious about days gone by. But Vonnegut, besides using this conceit to justify use of his childish drawings, does nothing with this narrative line. Maybe he develops the idea further in another novel. But, IMO, there's a shoe yet to drop in BoC. So it goes.I can't round up. Three stars."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"\\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is not Kurt Vonnegut's best work, but it still has one enviable trait, and that is the unmistaken Vonnegut voice. Mr. Vonnegut has one of the most unique voices in American literature and he uses it to full effect here. Although I rarely agree with his political and religious views, I still return to him because he writes in one of the most conversational tones I have ever come across. You feel like you and Vonnegut are conversing. It is this quality that allows you to forget some of the novel's more inane aspects.\\"BOC\\" has no plot to speak of, and I would be hard-pressed to narrow it down to only a few themes. Vonnegut tackles several possible thematic tracks half heartedly throughout the novel. These range from digressions on the relationship of the creator and his creation, the intrusion of an authorial persona throughout the text, and the nature of free will. Vonnegut also hearkens back to earlier gems such as the importance of minor life and details, the inequalities of capitalism, etc. And at times, he delivers some biting satire and thought provoking lines (and even paragraphs) on these topics. But alas, that is all he delivers. An occasional spark does not a fire make, and a witty or interesting point scattered here or there does not a novel make.This novel lacks cohesion...and that was Vonnegut's goal. I get it. I just don't like it.I have read a lot of Vonnegut, and I find this to be his weakest work by far. You may disagree, and I think that is the point."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book doesn't hold quite the weight as &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; or &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; to critics and many readers, but I believe it to be his funniest work without a doubt. Even thought it doens't make quite a grand of statement as those two books, it nonetheless is filled with brilliant satire and comments on our ridiculous society. The book may be even stronger because it was probably more difficult to make this subject matter work so well. The characters are memorable and you won't stop laughing. Any first-time Vonnegut reader would be doing fine to start here if they aren't as inclined to delve into his science-fiction works, and for those who started with them, you will not be dissapointed with this one."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I don't know about the rest of the world, but I found this particular Vonnegut effort bone-chilling. Its a direct strike at madness through the guise of normality rings true to me, or to anyone whose actually had a nervous breakdown.But I love the book. Its brilliant, honest, shocking and surprise-surprise: touching. Trout evokes in us, and most probably in Hoover, the need to seek truth in the most obscure places when real world seems putrid with pain and about to fall apart.Though not as outstanding as Slaughter-House Five, this is a personal effort worthy of remembrance, if only to understand the man better."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is in NO way sexist or racist. If you see it as racist because of the way the author describes a black man, you are truly an ignorant person. Vonnegut is just telling it like it is. When he says that rich white males rule the world, he isn't saying it's RIGHT, but simply that's how it is. This book was hilarious and haunting at the same time. Anyone who thinks it should not be analyzed, that it has no message, or that it is a bigotrous and self-centered book... wow... I actually would have to pity that person for not being able to fully enjoy this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I wrote a review of this book a few weeks ago, and it still hasn't shown up on amazon, so I thought that I'd have another go at it.The gist of my first review was that I thought that this book was entertaining and added much depth into the character of Kilgore Trout. The story was amusing and the pictures were interesting, yet sometimes seemed to be used just to take up space.But there was one main bad part of this novel: it overplayed the race card. I'm not saying that Vonnegut is himself racist, and do believe that he was using the issue in a satrical way, but it just went overboard. The N-bomb was dropped way too many times and all of the black characters in the novel were sterotypical. The novel's attempted humor is not akin to the type used in, say, Blazing Saddles; instead, it just seemed like bigotry.As a white man, I think the novel assumes a racist attitude. There are countless other books that deal with race much better, including Native Son, Invisible Man, and even The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which really does not seem very similar to this book.I liked the book, but it is just whimisical. If it actually seemed that Vonnegut was trying to make a clear cutting point about race relations, then I wouldn't be so hard on him. Unfortunately though, this theme never seems to precipitate, and the novel ends without making any dominant statement. The book is interesting, but ultimately shouldn't be classified as the \\"great literature\\" that some believe it to be."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I liked Breakfast of Champions; I read it over a period of 2 days after having found it lying on a desk in my English class. Breakfast of Champions is the first Vonnegut story I've read.I have read some of the scathing reviews here on Amazon. Most of them chide Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions as rude, pointless, and pretentious. I think these people are missing the point, which is: No matter where people go and what people experience, they bring everywhere they've been and everything they've experienced along with them. It's the same with writing. Every word a person writes or types is influenced by how he or she has ever felt about everything. I applaud Vonnegut for making this concept manifest in Breakfast of Champions. This is a book about humanity written by a human. It's honest. It's abrasive. It's always beautiful. And of course a bit of Vonnegut is going to bleed over into the story - and actually, literally, this does happen as Vonnegut gets his toe broken near the end of the novel. If this is pretentious, we're all a bunch of a-holes.Vonnegut is telling us through Breakfast of Champions that we can better understand ourselves by empathically seeking to understand what makes another human machine function. That our process to better ourselves is on-going, and will never cease, even if we think we're stuck in a podunk in the middle of the midwest or some where else we think we may be stuck. Life is a constant, sticky journey. What's reality? -Taking care of and freeing yourself and those you love. Simple."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is one of Vonnegut's best novels, an unusual combination of grimness, social critique, and sardonic humor. There are three main characters. Dwayne Hoover is a successful car salesman, but also a man that is slipping into madness. The second character is Vonnegut alter ego Kilgore Trout, the little-known sci-fi writer of interesting ideas and sloppy prose. The last character is Vonnegut himself. Vonnegut not only inserts his thoughts into the novel, but towards the end openly debates how to proceed with the story - providing a powerful end to the book. Naturally, these pages also combine Vonnegut-style philosophy, thoughts about free will, and social critique of the USA circa 1973. This book doesn't have a strong plot, and falls a bit short of the author's SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, but it's a powerful read nevertheless."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"A must read Vonnegut book.

It seems real simple, but if you tried to write it yourself, you'd find that having all the bits fit into each other (eventually) would be real tricky.

Thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book IS everything thats wrong with this world, and that is why it is so hilarious.

It is not difficult to see why: for an author known for his bizarre humor, it is perhaps Vonnegut's most bizarre and his most humorous."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt at his best...

It's a great book, maybe the best I've read, but Catcher in the Rye and Salem's Lot come close. I'm not gonna say how old I am, because no one would take my comments seriously, but I'm young. It is a great book for people at a young age, but seriously not for the D-student. It's somewhat complex, and in a way philosophical. Vonnegut has constructed a masterfull book full of dry humor and sarcastic wit, but it's serious. Make sure you understand that this isn't a parody, it's an insight into our society. With the pictures of &quot;wide open beavers&quot;, you may wonder what the hell Kurt was on when he wrote this, but I doubt he was out of it, it all works well together in the end. Anyway, I'm dawdling, so in short, read the book if you think you can."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I first read this book when I was in eleventh grade. In that grade we were studying American literature. I wasn't required to read this slick little number. But, it was easily more brilliant than Song of Solomon, The Awakening, or The Scarlet Letter.

Kurt Vonnegut ignores every law of formal writing and structure to give us this ugly, growling, balls-out,beautiful, American epic."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"France was in revolution at some point, and some bad things happenned; needless to say someone died and some other people probably starved to death.Vonnegut is the Wesley Willis of literature, except not crazy and schizophrenic, and he makes a lot more sense...and isn't dead!This book was great.

Pretentious comes to mind. Vonnegut trying so hard to be a literary genius that he goes the way of Pulp Fiction or Naked Lunch and just tries to make sure it doesn't quite make sense or have a point. Not impressed. For context, I love the books Ishmael, The Fountainhead, The Wheel of Time, Venus in Furs, The God of Small Things..."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Sorry, I just didn't get it. I liked Slaughter House Five. Vonnegut shows many signs of being a brilliant writer, even though I didn't understand the story. I knew much of it was satire, I just wish I could understand it. Since this is a very simple book to read I would actually recommend it, despite my low score."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I got hold of 'Breakfast' after reading 'Slaughterhouse', which impressed me, though I've found the prose style is not something a person can subject himself to at any great length without looking at his watch and wondering when the book will end. I was less impressed with Breakfast, though it was quite entertaining in parts. Some of the never-ending offshoots Vonnegut indulges in are interesting enough, but I believe he overdoes it. I also didn't like the way Vonnegut injects himself into the novel, more overtly as it progresses. I'm not sufficiently interested in Vonnegut as a person to be impressed - there was no real indication he is so remarkable a thinker that his presence was warranted. Some people seem to regard him as a genius, however, so if you're of that opinion you'd no doubt enjoy the glimpse into his background.I also found the outsider's persective quite annoying at times, and condescending. For instance, we're told that Communism is the idea that people should share, which us silly humans (Americans in particular) naively rejected. Any elementary school student doing history could tell you Communism has created more death and pain than any other ideology. Was the purpose to shock us with such glibness? I don't know, but whatever it was, it backfired. At other times Vonnegut's musings from this simplistic outsider perspective were funny and interesting, if occasionally peurile. There was nothing astonishingly original or inventive about it, as I saw it, but I was entertained enough to keep going to the end.I agree with reviewers who say there is not much literary substance to this book. It's light entertainment, and if you approach it that way, you're likely to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"The book was in perfect condition and arrived promptly. The book even smelled new! I'm super happy with my purchase. As a soft cover book, I was worried about a few imperfections but there were none"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book holds a very special place in my heart. It is the first book I ever threw away.It hasn't been the last.Back in 1976 I spent every Saturday at the local bookstore, and one day thought I would venture far from the Sci-Fi and Mystery shelves over to the BESTSELLERS! I would buy one, I thought, and take it home and expand my view. I saw this book, priced at the then unheard of price of $[...](you could get two paperbacks for that price back then), but I gulped and paid and sped home.Five minutes into reading I got that sickening feeling you get when you find out you've thrown your money away and you'll never get it back. Five minutes more only increased the sickness. I could stomach no more. I put it down. But I had a plan.I took it to Junior High the next day, and walking through the courtyard I took it from my backpack and spun it into the trash. I was immediately cleansed, and though I knew I would never get my money back I felt a rush of joy and lightness at having rid the world of such utter crap.Two good thing came of that event. Before, I treated and thought of books as sacred things. I did no longer. Books are not sacred. Good writing surely is. The second thing that happened is I never read another Vonnegut book. I put more effort into toilet paper than was put into that garbage. Having been treated so cavalierly by V-gut I determined not to be taken in again. No author deserves a second chance if the first contained so little effort. He spits in the face of the reader with this book with an attitude of: You'll read whatever I write because of who I am.Un-so. As a P.S., I opened a copy of B of Crap in the library some 20 years later to see if possibly I had been too immature in my Jr. High days and perhaps something of worth could be found within the pages. With pride at the profound insight of that young boy, I closed the book minutes later and put it back, assured that my first assessment had been correct. A piece of crap. Thank you, K.V., for teaching me the difference between good writing and resting on undeserved reputation."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Anyone who thinks 'Breakfast of Champions' is &quot;outright hilarious&quot; has a strange sense of humor. Not once was I even mildly amused. Was it the crude humor for shock value? The blatant attempts at teaching us lessons about our messed up society? If you are desperate enough to read this book, I recommend just looking at the pictures, that's about as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"It's amazing how Kurt Vonnegut has been able to hornswaggle readers for so long; and that he's finally being accepted as genuine literature by the elitist critics and professors demonstrates his thimblerigging proficiency. That said, I will admit &quot;Breakfast&quot; has the most accessable story of any of his books I've perused. The structure is at least interesting, the way he's managed to chop the narrative into sound bites and nevertheless make it coherent. What first puts one off this novel, though, are his windy pontifications. It seems almost a contradiction in terms to find a nihilist egoist, but somehow Vonnegut manages. I grew tired of the author long before the story itself grew tedious. If you enjoy Vonnegut's smug tendentiousness, I would recommend this book as one of his better efforts. If you're looking for mature fiction, pass by."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out 1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher, it would have been returned with a rejection form letter."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I disliked the book mostly on the way it was written. It was suppose to be funny or something, but I didn't find anything that funny. The part that turned me off was the writing style. Donnie did this Donnie did that, it was cute for a little bit, but I got very tired of it. I am unsure of what Kurt Vonnegut's style usually is, but if it is anything like this, I don't believe I will read another one of his books. I am a fan of ranting, and get to listen to a lot of good ones, but the style got in the way of all the fun. Yeah and it only took like 2 hours to read the entire thing. I normally don't review, but this one bothered me enough to.If you do read books only for the preface, this is your book. I thought the preface was quite entertaining...too bad it wasn't longer and the entire plot of the book."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This stands as a classic in contemporary American Fiction. Although I have enjoyed other Vonnegut novels more, none are more cynnical than the timeless BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Vonnegut narrates the tale of Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout, two strangers whos paths would cross with devastating consequences. Hoover is a wealthy owner of several business including a car dealership, he is also slowly going mad. Kilogre Trout is a novelist with underappreciated talent. His works only seem to be published in porno rags. While the story of their catastrophic encounter is humurous it serves mainly as a backdrop for Vonnegut's social criticism.Vonnegut uses BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS to not only ridicule obvious social issues (i.e. racism and pollution to name but a few), He also jabs at those establishments that most Americans would hold sacred. He mocks the founding fathers, explicitly chastising Thomas Jefferson as a man who wrote of the value of freedom while at the same time owning hundreds of slaves. He christens the military academies as institutions whos sole purpouse is to train mindless homicidal maniacs. As poignant as his finger pointing is, it remains evident that Vonnegut's purpouse is to educate and not to instigate.Having been written over a quarter of a century ago, it is amazing that BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS remains as relevant and enthralling as it was when first published. Read this book with an open mind and you will enjoy it. You need not agree with Vonnegut to appreciate his flair."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions makes you look at the world in a different light. Vonnegut points out the insanity of everyday life with a tremendous amount of cleverness. It wasn't as good as Slaughter House Five, but it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut has pulled off another classic with this one, alongside Cats Cradle, a great book, and others I have yet to read. The author uses Kilgore Trout who he uses also in Timequake, but in &quot;Breakfast&quot; Trout seems to fit in the story more and the story is more planned and assembled for this earlier work. But the Trout in this one and Timequake are both in different universes of the author's invention because trout die in 1981 in this book but he is alive for the timequake in the 90's.I like the idea that all characters, major and minor, have equal impact on the story. The cast of characters makes the story simultaneously funny and sad.As for the content: I am totally against censorship and politically corectedness, but being a member of the generation that follows 'X', my brainwashed mind could not help but cringe at some of the phrases used. Never mind that, though. Everything, the language, the drawings, everything in the book worked artfully."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Sarcastic take on the perception of early magazine scfi writing before Vonnegut moves onto other stuff. Strong on irony and as it written in 1973 quite environmental as well. Appeals to my twisted humour anyhow - best judged by reading the Sirens of Titan.Story: Dysfunctional society and how some make it, and others go crazy seen though Dwayne, a car dealer and Kilgore Trout famous author to two fans on a trip to an arts festival across America."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Aside from his sense of humor, which I like, I admire Vonnegut's ability, which he demonstrates in this novel, to mix the tragic with the absurd and come up with something both sad and comical. Long live Kilgore Trout!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I have read every work Vonnegut has written, and this is by far one of his best works. The characters are all very real, and allow the readers to get to know them. Illustrated by Vonnegut himself, this book is definately easy to read, yet hard to put down. The main character, Kilgore Trout, a Vonnegut favorite (perhaps Vonnegut himslef?) appears in yet another tale. As an aside, some of the books Vonnegut describes that Trout wrote, would make excellent sci-fi books. I'm surprised Vonnegut (or some literary plagarist or hack) hasn't expounded on any of the themes. The book is great, and if any reader has never read Vonnegut, this is a great one to start with. You'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"The answer is written on a bathroom wall within the pages of this book and examined between every line of it's text. The reader may not buy into Vonnegut's investigation of this question, but it's sublimely memoriable and as absurd as the lottery of life itself. The author's drawings serve to enhance the experience and set the tone of this unique and moral book."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is far and away the best book I have ever read! I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who have never read Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This novel is one of Vonnegut's more acclaimed works, although I would say, in my un-experted opinion, that The Sirens of Titan, Mother Night, and Hocus Pocus are better in many ways than Breakfast of Champions. Sure, Breakfast has many comical sections, however, it fails to answer any real question about human nature, other than the fact that we are innately dumb. The plot twists and turns, leading the reader through Vonnegut's &quot;reality&quot; of modern day society using Kilgore Trout and a used car salesmen as tour guides. Vonnegut plays on all aspects of society, from race, to industrialization, to the fragility of the human mind, and finally to the ability and far reaching possibilities of the imagination. Breakfast is witty and comical, but I recommend some of his other novels if you are looking for the better side of Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"How dare you give this masterpiece only 2 stars AND also claim that you've never read the novel? The ignorance in this world astonishes me."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is terrific satire and a joy to read, however, you must be willing to fore go the need for a single central character or a tidy ending. At the halfway point of the novel the narrative focus shifts from the main characters to the narrator himself. The book becomes some what autobiographical at this point in the novel, as Vonnegut opens up about his philosophy, background and the characters of his novels. It could be argued that this is a more effective technique if the reader is familiar with the Vonnegut oeuvre, however, I don't think it's necessary to read his other books to enjoy 'Breakfast of Champions'."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" Vonnegut gripes with such irresistible verve that it's a let down when \\"THE END\\" (or, in this case, \\"ETC.\\") appears. Scrawled, almost childish, cartoons punctuate the text throughout and add to the askew feel. As with many Vonnegut books, humor seems to sugar-coat deep confusion and bitterness. Numerous laugh-out-loud observations on the human condition and the corrupt state of the USA belie the novel's underlying seriousness. But calling this \\"a novel\\" with \\"a story\\" seems like a misnomer. Here \\"the story\\" provides a framework for Vonnegut to vent about the country he loves and hates. Even \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" gets derided, as well as the \\"baroque trash\\" displayed on the money. Other digressions, a la \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" which might have inspired Nicholson Baker's \\"overwhelming detail\\" approach, make this a curlicue tale replete with \\"too much information\\" moments. For example, the narrative expounds on character's intimate measurements. The squeamish will squirm and men will question their averageness. By book's end, everyone will question their sanity.Dwayne Hoover, the main character, does. In fact he loses it altogether in a final mutilating rampage. His homosexual son Bunny fares particularly bad. This bloody climax arrives when Hoover meets one of Vonnegut's most famous alter-egoes: science fiction writer Kilgore Trout. One of Trout's stories, \\"Now It Can Be Told,\\" convinces Hoover, whose mental health already hangs by a tendril, that everyone around him are machines and only he possesses free will. That idea serves as the book's main protagonist, the catalyst to d&eacute;nouement. A synopsis collage of Trout's other stories fills out the dramatis personae. These narrative tidbits loom just as large as the human characters. One memorable example concerns a story about aliens who communicate by tap dancing and farting. All the characters, stories and people, relate to the wider context of American culture in the early 1970s (remember C.O.D.?). Vonnegut finds much that confuses and disgusts him in that culture: the prevalence of songs that sell things, slavery's legacy and the \\"N\\" word (which appears with shocking frequency), environmental degradation, the yawning gap between the \\"fabulously well-to-do\\" and those who own \\"doodley-squat,\\" and overall senselessness. In the end, Vonnegut himself bursts into the story and plays God with himself and the characters. In a strange coming-out he confronts his creation, Kilgore Trout, and \\"sets him free.\\" Trout, who has just peeled coagulated toxic river sludge from his legs and lost the tip of a finger, pleads with the literary but all-too-human deity: \\"Make me young!\\"Though Vonnegut didn't seem to think much of \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" (he says \\"I feel lousy about it\\" in the preface and grades it a \\"C\\" in \\"Palm Sunday\\"), it nonetheless remains one of his most memorable books. It's a wild ride. The juxtaposition of dissolute text and bawdy schoolboy cartoons makes it a unique and unforgettable experience. Certain demographics will revel in its irreverence and \\"sick of the world\\" tone. It may even shock some readers, despite its age. Somehow, though it seems to argue that existence is mostly meaningless, cruel, and stupid, this strange book delivers a message of hope. Exposing the inanities of modern life provides the first crucial step towards their amelioration. Though we're not Gods, we can, like Vonnegut, fake it pretty well. We're not completely powerless. And, just as the world in \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is Vonnegut's creation for catharsis and manipulation, this world is our creation. We can set our fictions free. And this lesson alone makes \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" a worthwhile read. Add to that the cartoon of an anus and undiluted brilliance results. Read."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is perfect for reading in short bursts whenever you have a minute.

However, Breakfast of Champions stands out above and beyond as my favorite. Complete with Vonnegut's classic, almost childish drawings and an appearance by the author himself, this book is truly amazing. Vonnegut tells it all like it is, from Thomas Jefferson to Christopher Columbus. This book truly is a rare masterpiece from beginning to end, and I would greatly recommend it for anyone who likes to have a good, honest laugh at life and all its ups and downs."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast Of Champions is one of the top 5 pieces of satire in American literature.

He draws pictures. He satirizes anything from American politics, to the rich, to arts. And his does it his own loving way.

He's a guy whom most of us can plug in to. He ultimately goes berzerk. How he reaches this point in his life is the point of the book... sort of.Here we have more Vonnegut brilliance and hilarity and most readers will plug in to his satirical view of the basic human being (they don't get such a sterling rating from KV!).I think individual people come away from Vonnegut books, each with something different in mind and I think that most of them have seized upon some idea or character that they particularly liked that they have read about in his works. There's certainly plenty to like and to laugh about in here.And, there's no small amount of debate about which is Vonnegut's best book -- personally, \\"Dead-eye Dick\\" was the biggest hit with me.My highest rating for this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"It was a delight to read. Most of his stuff is. if you like his style in other books, you will probably like this as well."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"There were three main characters in this book. The first was Dwayne Hoover. Dwayne was suffering from a chemical imbalance. His decent into madness is chronicled throughout the pages of this novel.The second character is Kilgore Trout. His journey is more literal than Dwayne's. He travels across the country to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, so as to be the catalyst to Dwayne's ultimate demise.The third character is Kurt Vonnegut himself. The author in the first three quarters of the book tells the story from the perspective of the narrator, occasionally coming out of that role to tell the reader something about his mother/father/self etc. In the last quarter or so of the book he enters the story as a character and it's a little bizarre.The story is written as though it's for something not of this planet that doesn't know what tombstones look like or how we reproduce. It contains many little doodles to act as visual aids.This book is crazy. The thought process in it is rapid and intelligent.I didn't enjoy the ending of this book. After being given all of the detail-laden-pages that lead to the last ones it felt rushed. The climax of the story seemed to go by too quickly. I re-read the last chapters because I thought I missed something but I didn't, it just wasn't there."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Hilarious little book, and a quick read too. If you like Vonnegut's other books and haven't read this one, you will want to read it. The illustrations are great!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Many critics who have written their reviews below appear to believe that this book is either a brilliant summary of our society or a great big pile of trash.I believe that it is somwhere in between.Like Mark Twain, who warned his readers at the beginning of Huckelberry Finn to not analyze his literary work, nor try to find a point, Vonnegut seems to enjoy writing simply what he observes in every day life. Vonnegut never intends to have philosophical opinions and certainly doesn't wish to have his works read by Oprah's Book Club. Breakfast of Champions can offend almost any reader due to its racism, sexism, pornographic content, and political commentaries. This is the greatest aspect of the novel because Vonnegut tells his readers one thing that is very simple and blunt: he doesn't care what you think. This is a very refreshing quality for an author to possess because in today's world it is rare to stumble upon a written work that is not politically correct. Through reading this novel, I have come to respect Kurt Vonnegut for his honesty and his fearlessness in telling what he believes to be true. I only wish that there were more authors with Vonnegut's courage and talent."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is a good book.

It has been great fun reading Vonnegut with people who have Vonnegut-felt connections through our home city and Alma Mater. I found Breakfast of Champions the most disturbing on the 3 books. \\"Breakfast\\" can be read as racist, suicidal, penis-size obsessed, and crazy. But, it was still wacky existential fun. For those who care about narrative story, I think \\"Breakfast\\" has the most interesting narrative.Vonnegut had a love/hate relationship with his hometown Indianapolis. He loved to lampoon and praise Hoosiers and Indianapolis in his books. In \\"Breakfast\\" Vonnegut sneaks in references to his family's prominent history within Indy. He also reveals some disturbing information about Vonnegut familial relationships and his attitude toward his parents.The violence and racism in \\"Breakfast\\" is graphic and extreme. The humor is not so wry as frighteningly crazy. Where has Vonnegut's sweetness (e.g., Billy Pilgrim and Bokonism) gone? Vonnegut is downright cruel to his characters in \\"Breakfast\\"; even to his beloved alter ego Kilgore Trout.However, in an interview he gave late in life Vonnegut said he'd rather laugh than cry, \\"because crying was so much more messy.\\" Perhaps he got some of the crying out of his system writing \\"Breakfast\\".

I've only read Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, but BoC is basically written in the same style. The main characters are bizarre and the things that happen to them are random and senseless, so it's hard to identify with them. So much of the story is truncated with what I guess is Vonnegut's thing: &#34;and so on.&#34; Parts of the story were humorous, but I'm hard pressed to remember much if anything about this story because it's so senseless and transitory. I recall the central theme of the story made it worth reading, but writing this review 9 months and a few books later, I can't remember what the point of the story is."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I first read Breakfast of Champions when I was a freshman in college. At that time I found it inspiring and very, very funny and it inspired me to change the world--I just read it again (thirty five years later), and while I still found it entertaining it left me flat. Reading it as an older individual; it appears to me that Mr.Vonnegut's imagination was flowing in an idealistic river and looking for a utopia to moor his boat. As a young man with great dreams it all seemed so wonderful, but as an \\"upper' middle aged man, I realize that there are no utopias and maybe that is what his message was at the time and I missed it. But I still love Kurt Vonnegut!! Even if I maybe missed his message--maybe glad I did!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Reading this book was somewhat terrifying because someone finally saw the surreal nature of American society the way I do. I think this is one of the saddest, and somehow funniest, books ever. I can't believe it was published in 1973: it is still so relevant. The most incredible part of it is to hear things we've accepted about our society as part of life mirrored back at us so that we can feel their full absurdity. One section that will always stay with me was when Vonnegut talks about African American history in a matter of fact way (I'm paraphrasing here): \\"They were slaves, but then they were emancipated. They were not given land. They were free to go exploring.\\" The fact that that was what what really happened in our universe is so overwhelming that Vonnegut writes as if speaking to first time observers of earth: okay, this is the way earthlings decided to deal with a massive injustice? Anyway read the book. I don't think I've ever seen such great insight into our national pathologies."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"When you pick up a Vonnegut novel, it's so easy to breeze through it that you tend to underestimate the complexity of the ideas that are presented. Vonnegut has a gift for making plain, declarative statements that are seemingly simple, but which help you see the world in all its absurdity.In \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" Vonnegut shows his mastery of this technique. About guns: \\"Sometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too.\\" About speech: \\"Most white people in Midland City were insecure when they spoke, so they kept their sentences short and their words simple in order to keep embarrassing mistakes to a minimum.\\" About our economic system: \\"The planet was being destroyed by manufacturing processes, and what was being manufactured was lousy, by and large.\\" And so on.These witticisms or social comments, or whatever you want to call them, are strung throughout a book that moves at a frenetic pace. Ostensibly, it follows the converging paths of obscure novelist Kilgore Trout and insane businessman Dwayne Hoover. As Trout travels to Hoover's town, Midland City, we learn about Trout's negative philosophy of life through the plots of his novels, which inevitably end with the only innocent or good character or positive human creation being senselessly killed. Hoover, meanwhile, is a success in our real-world sense, and he even has some good personal traits (such as hiring African American workers when others wouldn't). But he has lost his grip on reality after his wife committed suicide, and he is questioning the value of living. Near the end, Trout and Hoover collide, and harm ensues for several people -- though those events also set of a chain reaction that the narrator tells us will eventually lead to worldwide fame for Trout and his negative philosophy.Nonetheless, plot isn't as important as the observations that the narrator and the characters in the novel toss continuously. While you're chuckling at the statments, you're also re-evaluating how you see the world. Things really are bad in a lot of ways, and it takes either blindness or an absurdist sense of humor to come to grips with it. Vonnegut is shaking us up by showing the absurdity in all its vividness.The most remarkable thing about the book, from my perspective, is that it was published in 1973, but it feels fully relevant today. Some of the comments about environmental pollution, war-mongering, bland consumerism, latent racism, random violence, etc., seem as if they could have been written in a blog this week. The issues were on the cusp of common consciousness in the early 70s when Vonnegut wrote \\"Breakfast,\\" but he saw them clearly at the time, and he sent out a warning. Too bad it hasn't been heeded."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Reading Breakfast of Champions, I realized that Vonnegut wasn't just satisfied with making a scathing and 'f***-all' satire on the American dream, or on racism and sexism, nor did he even want to make a revealing story of madness in the context of American history. No, he wanted to just made something that would SNAP out at you and make you realize it's not like any book before or since. It's not exactly fiction, it's not exactly non-fiction, nor biography or autobiography, or history or science fiction. It's like Vonnegut posits himself as some alien being viewing the very unlikely meeting of Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout in Midland City as a means to jump off to anything that comes up. He's concerned with the world, himself, and everything else, and it's thrilling, hilarious, odd, outrageous, crude, and extremely poignant, sometimes on the same page! It's certainly going to be one of the great affronts to literature I'll ever come across, and I recommend it highly to anyone who would be looking for the same."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I'm confused as to how people gave this 1 star. This was one of my favorite Vonnegut books. It isn't laugh out loud funny, or an unselfish attempt to please with a predictable plot, but it's not supposed to be. I found it conceptually exciting, and the end got me a little teary eyed because I empathize with what was illustrated (non-literally, although this book is full of cute illustrations).And with that in mind;If you like Vonnegut and you're not full of preformed thought about what a book *has* to be like, I recommend this book highly.If you're new to Vonnegut, and don't understand his wicked little world/style, this probably isn't the best starting point. Try Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"\\"What did you learn from this book?\\" That human beings are strange, unpredictable creatures capable of great love, great hate, lust, estrangement, (in)sanity, passion, art, Drano drinking, car sales, racism, and redemption. Also, sometimes they act like something on their bodies that looks like this:*(If Infinite Jest is an oak, Breakfast of Champions is its acorn.)"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is the first Vonnegut novel I have ever read, and I picked it up not knowing quite what to expect. This novel plumbs the psyches of a couple relatively twisted characters and brings them into contact with each other through some nice plot machinations. There is a cloud over this novel. A sense of foreboding is spurred on by the Author's dropping multiple hints and suggestions as to the unpleasantness that is about to occur towards the end of the novel. Daily life in America, particularly the Midwest, is skewered relentlessly as the Author tackles issues of bigotry, violence, stardom, and the corrosive nature of secrets. He also liberally sprinkles thought provoking Sci-Fi tidbits throughout in the guise of his main character's novels and book ideas. This book reminded me a little of both Fight Club and American Psycho, in that the main characters are almost irredeemably crazy and getting more so, yet they continue on with their lives, tainting people they meet while wandering through an almost oblivious world. At times the satire is laid on thick, and there can be a heavy hand when various social ills are expounded upon over and over again. I also found the book to be more thought provoking and disturbing than comical, which is not a criticism. I will read more by Vonnegut based on my experience here."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"The first Vonnegut book i read was Slaughterhouse-five, then Cats Cradle, and i have to say, breakfast of champions is just as good. I read breakfast of champions in one night, the second i picked it up i could not put it down. Kurts prose is so unlike any other author, although i did find som similarities between this book and Sluaughterhouse-Five. The way he reapeats certain phrases to get them stuck in your head or just to create an overall feeling, in SH-5 it was \\"so it goes\\" diminishing the impact of death on the reader for the insight that that person is not really dead but just ina bad place at that moment. And in Breakfast of champions he often end paragraphs with \\"and so on\\" which he himself makes note of in the the book, because like the plastic material that permeates the creek in his book and life in general it just keeps going on an on and on and so on, for ever and ever and ever ECT."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I think Breakfast of Champions can be summed up by this quote from the book:\\"...there is no order in the universe around us....we must adapt ourselves to the requirements of chaos instead.\\" (p. 215)Based on that, you've likely (and correctly) surmised that the tone of the book is largely bleak and pessimistic. It's also largely plotless and rambles. However, it's never dull, it will get you thinking, and even while it is pointing out the bleakness and meaninglessness of life, there is a light that shines here that will make you laugh and shake your head at the absolute absurdity of it all. This isn't Vonnegut's best book (that would be eitherSlaughterhouse-FiveorCat's Cradle) but it is still a must read for anyone who enjoys his mix of pessimism, philosophy and dark humor. Recommended."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I'm definitely a Vonnegut fan, and despite my lack-luster review of this book, it was not enough to detour me from reading more of him. However, this one just didn't hold my interest in the same manner as his others. Yes, Vonnegut delivers satirical social commentary, but for me, it was at a much slower, more disguised pace than his norm. I was not compelled to read the book in one fell swoop as I normally am with a Vonnegut book."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions reads as a fresh work, considering today's political climate. It is a very anti-American novel and, depending how you voted in the last election, you will either love it or hate it. The plot concerns a science fiction author, Kilgore Trout (a pun on real-life author Theodore Sturgeon), and a car dealer named Dwayne Hoover. Hoover is going out of his mind and - after reading one of Trout's books - comes to believe that he is the only person in the world who isn't a robot.This is an experimental novel. Vonnegut writes himself into the book and fills it with crude illustrations. It is funny, biased, and thought-provoking look on American society. It doesn't have a traditional \\"beginning, middle, and end.\\" Vonnegut expressly states that he disdains traditional fiction writing because it makes people believe that they should act like characters in books. It is difficult to imagine agreeing with Breakfast of Champions one-hundred-percent, but it will give you plenty to think about."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Dig it. I do anyways. Maybe you won't. It's entirely up to taste and whatnot. Vonnegut's story is lovely, and so is Vonnegut's storytelling. Vonnegut tells his tale in a condescending manner. He talks to the world as if we're all a bunch of kids, having to show us little pictures of everything. This storytelling is often hilarious, though it can get annoying to some people. The book is about our rotten, lowly existence. Vonnegut condescends because people are (apparently in Vonnegut's eyes) generally idiots, and Vonnegut is god of this story. He even steps into the story (love it of hate it) and chills out in his own creation. All powerful and completely omniscient, he tells you about everyone and everything in the city. Making for wonderful characterization. By the end, Midway City seems to breathe. Some will love this. Others will be completely annoyed by Vonnegut laughing in their face and his madcap style."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut, justly nicknamed one of the greatest satirists of the time, is truely magnificent in this book. 'Breakfast' proves to be a terrifyingly accurate description of society while at the same time is so obscure and comical... I enjoyed his style very much, especially towards the end of this book when Vonnegut introduced himself into the story. Anyone can benefit from reading this."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Although this book has it's high points, like Vonnegut's humorous observations about America, it isn't as good as Cat's Cradle or Slaugherhouse-Five. The reason for this is because the author literally tells you how the book ends, numerous times. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Though I typically find KV's books very entertaining, this one just didn't do much for me for the first 9/10 of it. Vonnegut usually has some phrase or idea he repeats extensively in his novels; you may remember \\"ting-a-ling\\" or \\"So it goes\\"; well, in this novel, which is excessively badly pornographic in passing, Vonnegut feels the need to tell you the size of every male character's member upon introduction; It really doesn't serve any central purpose to the story.Two of the key characters, Rabo and Kilgore, are served up much more fascinatingly and entertainingly in other books. He also includes a TON of drawings, which are only necessary maybe one fifth of the time. I guess I believe he has a problem with moderation!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"If you are a moron who can't see through the surface of a work of literature, don't read this book. Parts of this book feature discriptions of racism, not by the author, but by society. The word &quot;nigger&quot; is mentioned from time to time in the course of this book. The word &quot;nigger&quot; is also mentioned in the literary classic &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, and in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, both written by Mark Twain. This book is no more racist than either of those two anti-racism, anti-slavery novels.Let me clear this up once and for all: This is not a racist book! Kurt Vonnegut is not only a highly liberal person, but he's a socialist(Eugene V. Debs is one of his heroes)for crying out loud! Vonnegut uses those &quot;naughty words&quot; to be blunt and to the point, to confront us with the problems in our society.This entire book is a journey through America and it's problems, laying bare prejudices such as racism, classism, and the like. He exposes the lack of a cohesive culture in America, and he does so in both blunt and subtle manners, unfolding not just a story of a car salesman's insanity, but more importatly, taking the opportunity to use Kilgore Trout's journey from Cohoes to Midland to illustrate the emptiness of American life.Without a cohesive culture, Vonnegut shows that American life is a listless, hollow experience. Even the main story of Car salesman Wayne Hoover's insanity is subordinate to this theme, as his mental unbalances often display the same lack of values and feeling in the American Experience.For example, he stops at a diner on his way to Midland City, and he is suffering from a symptom of Schizophrenia that makes him repeat the last word someone else says. He engages in conversation with a waitress there, who fails to notice that he is repeating the last word of every sentance she speaks. She doesn't notice because she doesn't pay attention to what he says. She, like everyone else in her town, like everyone else in her country, expects nothing more than empty small talk, and gives Wayne Hoover typical automatic responses to everything he says. The theme of humans being like robots, and living like robots figures prominently in the story, as mentioned in the novels of Kilgore trout, Vonnegut's alter-ego. This book is a warning to Americans that we are wasting away."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"If you are easily offended, then this novel might not appeal to you. Also, I would warn those new to Vonnegut to read other novels of his first. This is not his typical style, and it might turn off new readers instead of endearing them. Slaughterhouse Five, Player Piano, Sirens of Titan, or Bluebeard would probably make good first time Vonnegut novels (I started with Player Piano then Cat's Cradle). Additionally, there are many characters in this novel which appear in other Vonnegut novels, several who appear in novels written after this. But I still feel that Bluebeard and Deadeye Dick should be read before this novel, at the very least so that you recognize with amusement characters like Rabo Karabekian (Bluebeard) and Dwayne Hoover (Deadeye Dick) as well as the setting of Midland City (Deadeye Dick, though Midland City is in Indiana in this novel and in Ohio in the other). Kilgore Trout is a fictitious writer appearing in several Vonnegut novels. He is based on the real life writer Theodore Sturgeon, whom Vonnegut knew early in his writing career.In Breakfast of Champions, Vonnegut takes every rule of literature and throws them out the window. First, Vonnegut writes it as himself. He also inserts himself into a few parts of the novel. At one notable section, the author Vonnegut actually converses with the character Vonnegut. His characters use racial slurs regularly, but it's part of the nature of the novel. There are also many drawings by Vonnegut which add to the absurdity of the novel. They are rudimentary at best and are usually preceded by the words \\"... and it looked like this:\\". Often the drawings are about something mentioned in the writing but that has no real effect on the story. In a couple of chapters later in the novel, Vonnegut begins introducing male characters by their name and then the length and width of their erect penis. Seriously.The novel is filled with hundreds of short 'snippets', that is sections that are usually one paragraph, or sometimes multiple paragraphs, broken into pieces with a little black arrow in front of each. They appear almost as if they are bulleted lists. And in fact, each little bulleted snippet has a particular subject or viewpoint. The flow is interesting to say the least. It takes a little getting used to, but if you relax and let go of most preconceived formats of writing, then it is an enjoyable experience. And that is what makes this unconventional novel work.The novel is a major slap in the face to capitalist society. Vonnegut never really tries to dish out lessons or mores, but instead points out things that people do and then allows the reader to draw their own conclusions. One particular section that I enjoyed Vonnegut wrote of a hamburger: \\"> A hamburger was made out of an animal which looked like this:\\" (insert drawing of cow) \\"The animal was killed and ground up into little bits, then shaped into patties and fried, and put between two pieced of bread. The finished product looked like this:\\" (insert crude drawing of a hamburger).It is the little quips that keep the reader interested. As mentioned earlier, Vonnegut doesn't seem to be preaching, a huge distinction between him and Tom Robbins (whom I feel was more 'preachy'), an author of novels in a similar, satirical style. Instead this reads more like Catch 22, where sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. If your views slant towards the right, then you will probably not be amused. If you seem to favor leftist, even socialist views, then you might find a bit more amusement in this novel. It's delightfully complex despite seeming so straightforward on paper.Vonnegut stated that he wrote this novel to 'clear out his head' and to bid farewell to his characters. Ironically, he used a few in later novels. In his self assessment he rated this novel a C. It's not his best novel, but if you are reading his entire lineup of novels, then this is the best way to cap it all off."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In modern parlance, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is what would be called a meta-novel. It's largely a novel about writing a novel. Though since this is Vonnegut it's not about a guy sitting at a typewriter or anything that boring. It's more like in \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" when characters would go to the holodeck to interact with holographic representations of stories like Sherlock Holmes or noir detective Dixon Hill.In this case the author is Philboyd Studge (a stand-in for Kurt Vonnegut) and the holodeck is set to Midland City, Indiana in 1972. The town is hosting a Festival of the Arts and the wealthy Eliot Rosewater (of the previous novel God Bless You Mr. Rosewater) contacts his favorite sci-fi author Kilgore Trout, featured in many other Vonnegut books. Trout is shocked anyone's actually read any of his books as his stories are mostly published in porno magazines as filler with the titles often changed. So Trout decides to go to New York City and then hitchhike to Indiana.Meanwhile in Midland City is Dwayne Hoover, who owns a Pontiac dealership and several other businesses. By all accounts Dwayne has it pretty good, except his wife \\"ate\\" some Drano and died while his gay son works as a pianist in the Holiday Inn Hoover partially owns.The lounge of the Holiday Inn is where Hoover and Trout are destined to meet and where Hoover is destined to lose what's left of his mind. Also in that lounge is Philboyd Studge, who has gathered his creations together to create a sort of creative Big Bang that will wipe out the old Philboyd Studge universe and create a new one.In the preface, Studge writes about how now that he's turned 50 he wants to sort of clear the air and empty out all these old ideas and characters so that he can create new ones. Ironically though many of these same characters like Kilgore Trout appear in future novels by Vonnegut like \\"Deadeye Dick,\\" \\"Bluebeard,\\" and \\"Timequake.\\" So if the point was to reboot the Vonnegut universe (to use modern comic book/movie slang) it didn't really succeed.Like many Vonnegut novels, the characters are in no way realistic. Vonnegut via Trout actually takes \\"realistic\\" novels to task, claiming that we already know about real life, so why would we want fiction to duplicate that? (I agree in part with that idea. I mean, most of life is pretty boring, so why would I want that in a novel?) Like my colleague Ethan Cooper, I would agree that the characters are largely cartoonish throughout the novel. That didn't bother me too much, maybe because I watch too many cartoons on Fox and Adult Swim.Throughout the novel Vonnegut includes silly drawing of everything from an anus to a bucket of fried chicken to the abbreviation ETC. The intent of these seems to be to serve as flashcards for a future audience where Earth no longer has apples or fried chicken, though you'd have to think they would still know what an anus looks like unless humanity has evolved beyond that point or superintelligent robots or cockroaches have taken over. Like Ethan Cooper, I found this device tiresome after a while as it didn't really seem to contribute much to the actual story.Another thing is that this novel frequently uses the \\"N-word\\" and the depiction of most of the black characters in the book is pretty demeaning, especially the ex-con Wayne Hoobler. Though I like to think of it not as racist but as a satire to protest the economic segregation that is still largely prevalent in the 21st Century.Overall, while the end may be a little disappointing, it is a heck of a ride to get there.That is all."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut offered \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" to himself as a fiftieth birthday present, a way to say \\"Goodbye, Blue Monday\\" to his obvious issues with own depression and his mother's suicide. Viewed uncharitably, BoC might be seen as the author treating his reader as therapist, spewing whatever invective comes into his mind onto the page. But the reason this is more interesting than your average midlife crisis is because, not only is Vonnegut hilarious, but Vonnegut's crisis represents that of the country, which in 1973 finds itself embroiled in a deep and seemingly intractable crisis of capitalism, the promises of post-war growth so clearly spent, with the results of communities torn asunder, environmental devastation, racial strife, and imperialist imbroglio. Growing up in the depression (\\"so many Americans believed then: that the nation would be happy and just and rational when prosperity came\\"), coming of age during the World War (in which he would see an even more unjust and irrational side than most), Vonnegut must settle his accounts not only with his parents but with the false promises of American ideology - and does so right off the bat in the irreverent first chapter.Despite the \\"evil nonsense which children were taught\\", the country with the \\"balderdash\\" national anthem was founded by \\"sea pirates\\" who \\"used human beings for machinery\\" and \\"disciplined other countries by threatening to shoot big rockets on them\\". And consistent with the growing concerns of the early 1970s, the industrial destruction of the land is a major theme in BoC. Vonnegut's alter-ego and creation Kilgore Trout surveys the damage as he hitchhikes in an olive truck past New Jersey sludge and West Virginia strip-mining. In Trout's science fiction, alien visitors note that the \\"every form of life on the once peaceful and moist and nourishing blue-green ball was dying or dead\\". Of course, Trout has long since given up: \\"There's a river in Cleveland which is so polluted it catches fire about once a year. That used to make me sick, but I laugh about it now.\\" Gilgongo! As it's not just the landscape that's bleak, Trout sees himself (and thus does Vonnegut) as \\"a representative of all the thousands of artists who devoted their entire lives to a search for truth and beauty - and didn't find doodley-squat!\\"Instead, Vonnegut scribbles a charcoal of a world where \\"human beings are robots, are machines\\". He looks back on the syphilitics he used to see in Depression Indianapolis \\"vertebrae welded together after the corkscrews got through with the meat between\\". To Vonnegut in crisis, we are all symphilitics, defective machinery; \\"machines made out of meat\\", \\"black machines\\", \\"agreeing machines\\", \\"defective child-bearing machine\\", \\"disappearing machine\\". Machines driven deterministically by \\"bad chemicals\\". And since humans are machines, we are acquainted with minute details of every orifice and sex act that they like to perform. This is the early 1970s after all, and America and Kilgore Trout are getting acquanted with Times Square smut houses.Of course, while Dwayne Hoover learns to think humans are machines from Kilgore Trout (their meeting is the plot anchor of the book), Vonnegut doesn't actually think so - or at least he is conflicted. There is a strip of day-glo orange tape running down his dark canvas. That is the abstract art of Rabo Karabekian, representing \\"the immaterial core of every animal... it is unwavering and pure, no matter what preposterous adventure may befall us.\\"Through Vonnegut though, the \\"unwavering and pure\\" side of the human spirit doesn't seem all that convincing. It's more something he must believe in, to keep the bad chemicals from forcing him to succumb to the same fate as his mother, Dwayne Hoover's wife, etc."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is odd. It is filled with strange characters, and tongue in cheek observations. Written in short snappy sentences, it is on the surface a very easy book to read. I found it funny, almost cartoon like in its depiction of Trout and Dwayne's journey to their meeting. It is not really about much but is full of anecdotes on the characters lives. People are mostly described in terms of robot machines, their reactions programmed by their creator. It is hard really to convey a feeling for what exactly this is. I never read any by this author before and initially thought it might be science fiction as the narrator describes elements of the ordinary, such as flags and storks etc., as if the reader inhabits a world different from earth which might be no more. Also there is an equally strange departure into describing penis and bust dimensions in character descriptions about half way through. I loved the tongue in cheek style, the amusing bites of satire and the general air of insanity. Well worth a wander though, this is a book which will make me chuckle to myself as I remember bits."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I had decided to read a Vonnegut novel since there is so much buzz among some of my elitist friends about what a genius he is. I was not dissappointed.The book had a very interesting feel to it. I appreciated the way that the author would deliberatley stray from the subject from time to time as if he was telling a story rather than writing a book. I also liked the way he satirizes American culture. He describes a common occourence like it was the first time you had ever heard about it. For instance he feels he must remediate the reader as to why men buy pornography.Some other reviewers have commented about the amount of racism in the novel. It is true that there is a lot of racism in the book, but I think that the author does this to show the evil inherent in racism and not to be racist himself, much the way Mark Twain does in Huckleberry finn. To acknowledge that racism exists does not make you racist.The novel builds to a very interesting climax which presents a paradox that I never seen done in American literature. I will reveal this paradox only because it is what attracted me to the novel in the first place. If you do not want to know read no further.Vonnegut writes himself into the novel and confronts his main character revealing to him that he is a fabrication, a creature of his own mind."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Book came on time and in good condition.

It was a very awesome book. As always he has a way to bring you into his mind and into the story. I began to wonder if he was a character in the story as well, maybe Dwayne or Trout.I never read a book where the writer confronts the main character in the book Kilgore Trout as he is writing it. It made me laugh really, if Trout was indeed Mr Vonnegut looking though a leak(mirror);lost in an endless pursuit or quest on the meaning of life. He puts alot of himself into the novel. A wonderful story and very funny, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far, this is my 2nd favourite out of all three.

It's story tells of Dwayne Hoover, a car salesman who is slowly going insane, and of course Kilgore Trout, the science fiction writer whose on his way to Dwayne's home, Midland city, to an arts festival he's just been invited too. My favourite part is the ending. Now I won't spoil it for you, but when I finished the book I felt the ending to be quite dissapointing, but I thought about it for awhile and decided I loved afterwards. Vonnegut creates a beautiful portrait of insanity and humour in this brilliant piece of fiction!!!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This being my first ever experience with Vonnegut, I don't think I was ready for the incredible words written within it(not to mention the pictures drawn). This book not only made me more interested in other Vonnegut novels, but also changed the way I looked at the craft of writing and the way I look at the world.In between bouts of gut-busting laughter, I found insights into the human race, society, politics, sex, and lonliness which were all very well expressed and honest. Vonnegut shows all that is egregious in America and the world, and presents it to us in a humourous way. Read this book...it may change your life."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"If you are a Vonnegut fan than this book is a must read. His quirky humor and abstract delve into the idiosyncracies of our human existence are not only hysterical, but will make you put down the book, think, and re-read sections to truly grasp the absurdity of our existance and question the monotony of our everyday lives.If you enjoyed this also read Slaughterhouse Five!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a master.

(Bruce Willis got the part!) Vonnegut's beautiful phrases are few and far between. His ironic truths are delivered in short, straightforward sentences--a sometimes gentle, sometimes not so gentle confrontation. Vonnegut is in a class by himself. Unlike other satirists, he shows a genuine affection for his characters, reflecting what must be a great love for the human race--despite its foibles that he so expertly identifies. His black comedy is rendered with a sensitivity that elecits tender feelings and fondness for his characters, who are neither heroes nor villains, but people like ourselves who have stubbed their toes walking life's path. His c! omic irreverence always serves to let us know ourselves better, and he leaves no sacred cow unmilked. About the discovery of America in 1492, he says, &quot;Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them.&quot; BOC is among Vonnegut's finest writings, something of a summary of his first fifty years of experience as a human being."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"First of all, I wasn't an English major so I can't talk to you about grand themes and insights. What I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this book yet is to just pick it up some where and look at a few of the pictures and read a snippet or two of the book. I can almost guarantee you'll buy it. The humor was great as were the observations. I just finished &quot;&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; and have made it my mission to read the rest of his stuff by the end of summer.I've also found this book helps fend off muggers. After you read it you'll start thinking about it at odd times and places and just break out laughing, which is what I often do at the bus and train stations in Chicago. It's great how people veer away from you when you do that.LOOK AT THE PICTURES!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"My first Vonnecut novel, it is the best of all those I've read.

Completely thought provoking, I don't think that there is a single book that can be so simple in its writing, yet comment so much on the society we live in.

Vonnegut's style is dripping throughout the pages, an irreverant showcase of wit and perspective.Some of the work IS dated, but the clever viewpoints and wit still remains. His style of explaining things, such as fried chicken, completely and honestly, is amazingly addictive. If this novel were better editted (with Vonnegut's style, some things fail) it would earn from me that fifth star.Better than Slaughterhouse-Five in my oppinion. Read it!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I reviewed this book about a year ago but over that time have turned the story over in my mind enough to warrant another look. The story, I stated previously, is sub-par compared to Vonnegut's other works (Slaughterhouse, Cradle) and ultimately is a mess. Though I maintain that this is indeed an accurate description, I must submit to the possibility that such was in actuality intentional and that indeed many of the ideas presented outright in the novel merely constitute the very surface of what the author may truly be attempting to express.If the works of Kurt Vonnegut have taught me anything at all, they have taught me this... If one fails as an artist to communicate any given idea or experience, their next goal by default as one who aspires to bring any meaning into existence is to communicate or express the tale of that failure. As much as I hate to admit it, this lends some logic to the Roman Catholic outlook on existence... Perhaps then, in the artistic realm, confession indeed purifies the soul. If one cannot skillfully tell the story that God or the divine does or does not exist, perhaps then the story of their failure will lend some important insight on the complexity of that particular riddle.In light of this, and because nearly all of Vonnegut's works touch on this idea, the concept that \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is not what it appears to be can be considered valid. What then is this story about? I have my own theories, but perhaps they are incorrect.This then is the tale of the destiny of a fictional character when presented with the role of communicating a singularity of meandering ideals, philosophies, and perspectives born of a society which amid it's evolution into chaos has grown inhumane, presented by an artist unwilling to chain everything into a working model of the divine or profound because of the equally terrifying possibilities of inhumanity and insanity. THIS then is the story of \\"KILGORE TROUT\\".As I have stated perhaps I am wrong. If you read it however, consider for a moment everything Vonnegut brings up in his chaotic dictation on America and humanity. How could all of these ideas ever come together? Remember too that the story begins with a line from the biblical story of Job, a human born to suffer the torture of God to prove a point to Lucifer. Could you do the same to poor Job? What would it mean about humanity? What would it mean about God?"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I read this book the night I quit my first university. I was in a funk since I had decided that being an english major was pointless and the future seemed bleak and uncertain.I stayed up all night reading this novel, utterly amazed at the manner that Vonneggutt wrote and constructed the story. It was a liberating experience and it taught me that one can write in any manner one chooses.The almost grade school descriptions of activities do such a marvelous job of baring the reality of how we really are.This is a wonderfully instructive novel that will open your mind and help to sweep out the debris that may have gathered there."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut is probably one of the best, but at the same time, one of the crudest books that I have ever read. The plot, even though thought there really is no plot, is infact the specific views that Vonnegut has about many things in life ranging from war to as far as love. While some of the topics that Vonnegut discusses have some importance, most of them are not really important at all.Throughout the book, Vonnegut shares his views on America with the reader. The theme of the book can arguably be how Vonnegut is dissatisfied with the different kind of things that people in America will do. There is a quote that expresses these views. He talks about the not-so-famous becoming famous, \\"Sometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too\\" (50). The quote shows just how fed up he is with the rest of civilization. Even though he is disgusted with majority of the problems, he talks about them and makes what is wrong in his mind, funny to others.In my opinion, this book is a must read. I don't like reading at all, and I actually liked this book. I liked it in particular for the humor aspect of it, the way he talks about things, and even adds his own little clip-art for things every now and then. The drawings are hand drawn, funny pictures, showing just exactly his views on the certain topic. Overall the book was a great choice for an independent reading project. If you have yet read Breakfast of Champions, and are looking for a good book to read, this should be on the top of your list."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"vonnegut is purely addictive.i simply can not stop reading his stuff...hmmm, leaves me wondering what to do once i have run out...alas, this is quite a good read, i found it tough to put down.vonnegut employs a good number of his tested and true techniques, of dropping in common characters, explaining through trout books, and slicing back and forth between parts of his story so as to keep the pace rather quick.vonnegut throws a lot of himself in here...in fact, he does throw himself in here, nice touchleaving the reader wondering just as much about the author as about the characters.his conversational nature makes this a nice light read, but leaves enough philosophical questions floating around in your head to keep you interested after you have put the book down"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I love this book. It is full of insight, humor, beauty, some wisdom, and some juvenile asides just to make all seem less overwhelming. Kurt Vonnegut knows how to make tough thoughts go down easier. He is the reader's friend. Just don't be like Duane Hoover and mistake friendship for spiritual guidance. We're all individuals with free will, as this book reminds us."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"What a fantastic departure from the contemporary fiction I usually read.Vonnegut's storytelling has no limits or restrictions; he happily runs straight for the edge of human imagination and keeps going."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I just finished B of C for the third time. First was in high school English, second was during a hernia operation, and this most recent reading - during my teenager's 3-day suspension. Each new reading brought a new laugh during a dire time...Vonnegut's selective vision and point of view are timeless, every bit as cherished now as three decades ago. If his story telling style doesn't grab you, certainly the artwork will in this, what I consider to be KVJ's greatest achievement.B of C will make a collector out of you."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This novel follows the trajectories of the failed science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout and the mentally unravelling used car salesman Dwayne Hoover as they head for a collision at a modest arts festival in the American Midwest. Vonnegut uses this spare plot as a point of departure for observations on numerous topics of interest. Some literary gimmicks get in the way of the enjoyment: Vonnegut's habit of explaining commonplace things as though he were addressing an alien with no concept of Earthly existence, and the integration of drawings by the author into the text. Both would have been more effective had they been used more sparingly. Nevertheless, this book is often funny and sometimes profound."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Why do I like this book?Because the first few pages are fact. Let's call it historical revisionism, although many would call it \\"communist thinking.\\" The author debunks various myths, and acknowledges the positive role one Phoebe Hurty played in developing Mr. Vonnegut into a person who constantly challenged conventional wisdom, making a career out of being \\"impolite.\\"Because the rest of the book, which is the story of a chance encounter between two \\"old white men on a planet that was dying fast,\\" is pure, crazy, unadulterated fiction. The characters are totally made up by a man named Philboyd Studge, Vonnegut himself, who manipulates them like puppets, especially at the end, but not before one runs amok, sending all sorts of people to the hospital in a senseless rage which fits into Vonneguts world view which is basically that life is crazy and that nothing makes sense. But then again, why should anything make sense. \\"So it goes.\\"Actually, there aren't too many \\"so it goes,\\" if any, in this book. I think that's another book. But in this book there is Kilgore Trout, an unkempt, \\"dirty old man\\" who is a highly prolific creator of science fiction who sends his prose to a publisher of porn (and never gets paid even though his books are featured in porno magazines throghout America), instead having to hunt it down later in dirty book stores across the nation. The other main character is one Dwayne Hoover, a used/new car salesman who eventually goes crazy, but not before sending a lot of people to the hospital. This is all played against the flat, Ohio Valley backdrop of Midland City, Indiana, according to many the \\"A**hole of the Universe,\\" scene of the upcoming Midland City Arts Festival at which Mr. Trout is scheduled to speak, and which, because of Mr. Hoover's running amok, never really gets off the ground. A lot of the book is a view of the Universe according to highly creative and terribly unorthodox machinations of Kilgore Trout's mind. As usual there is a myriad of colorful characters, and subplots among subplots among subplots. The complexity of this book with a seemingly simple message (Life is crazy? I dunno, so it must not be that simple) is mind boggling. But aren't most Vonnegut novels like that?By the way, Breakfast of Champions is what one of the waitresses calls a cocktail that Mr. Hoover usually orders.Remember what Kilgore Trout said: \\"We are healthy only to the extent that our ideas are humane.\\"Ain't that the truth.Five Stars. Rick says check it out, for sure."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Part memoir, part novel, part experimental meta-narrative, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is a jumbled assortment of literary devices and imagination rolled into a book peppered with felt-tip drawings by the author. To give it a plot is to loosely give you an idea of what's going on in the book though really it only makes up for a third of it or so: Kilgore Trout, pulp novelist, is invited to a literary festival at the behest of his only fan, a wealthy eccentric called Eliot Rosewater, in the same town where Dwayne Hoover, a Pontiac salesman and Burger Chef franchise owner, is slowly losing his mind and is destined for a fateful encounter with the eponymous Trout.I quite like Kurt Vonnegut's work. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" was pretty good, while his posthumously published \\"Armageddon in Retrospect\\" was enjoyable as well, though I've started and stopped \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" maybe twice now because I've found it unreadable and difficult to get through. I made it through this book, one of his more popular and well known works, but I found it not without its own problems.What's annoying the most is the random nature of Vonnegut's writing. When he writes his fictional narrative he diverges into stark, almost patronising, moments of explication where he has to inform you what something he's just mentioned is. For example what the United States is, what capitalism is, a moment in history, and then an explanation followed by a drawing of something irrelevant like a t-shirt or a finger. Then he goes down another sidetrack into a moment of memoir about his own life before getting back to the (increasingly boring) story. Then he addresses the reader, informing them when he is writing fiction and that everything he says and does when doing so is made up (duh) and telling the reader when he's writing non-fiction. Then he tells you what a burger is by drawing a cow and then a burger. It's all so frustratingly pointless.Vonnegut, rather tellingly, writes at the start about recently turning 50 and how this book is a way of getting all of the junk out of his head, and the book ends with the words \\"make me young, make me young!\\" so maybe the novel is a reaction to growing old/a kind of late mid-life crisis. Or the rather wearying and scatological form of storytelling in the book might be a reaction to his fears of mental illness which plagued his mother, eventually causing her to take her life, and which dogged Vonnegut throughout his own life, leading to his suicide attempts.The patchwork nature of the book belies the claims of other fans of his work that it is a masterpiece, which I contest. The fact that the book reads like Vonnegut bouncing around the walls of his brain does not make this anything more than what it reads like - a mess. The characters are barely there, the story is irrelevant to Vonnegut's seemingly sole purpose of showing how a novelist is like a puppet master - the meta angle - which, reading it in the 21st century, is quite dull. It's also quite a miserable novel in tone with Vonnegut labelling doing a job without purpose \\"suicide\\" and boiling down descriptions of male characters to penis size and female characters to breast/wait size.The book comes across as a hodge-podge of non-sequiturs, scraps of ideas, half-baked stories and a lot of Vonnegut talking to reader about how his book doesn't really hang together, how pretentious the role of the author is, and how doomed we all are. It's like reading a book by a mentally deranged bore standing on a box pointing out the bleeding obvious. \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is a long way from being a masterpiece and is quite dull to read as well as being one of Vonnegut's least interesting books."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I have red most of Vonnegut's books and I love them all. If you never read anything from Vonnegut do not start with this one. Start with Slaughter House 5 or Cats Craddle. It is better to have an idea what you are in for.

KV is a true philosopher and honest fellow of our century. Not only is this book wonderful, the characters and the side stories for each of them are captivating for the reader. Once you read BOC or any of KV's novels, you will become enchanted and hooked.KV changed my life and put into words so many abstract thought I could never had vocalized on my own.

But one could argue, as most of Vonnegut's cult-like followers do, that this within itself offers an original style in American literature. After 100 pages I put the book down out of a lack of interest (and out of respect to the author since I didn't want to end his last book on my booklist on a sour note) only to pick it back up when the characters, as well as Vonnegut's style, beckoned my subconscious.You either hate it or love it, there is no in-between and sometimes its a combination of both.

The point is, &quot;You&quot; feel that way. Or you don't. This is how Vonnegut's use of the &quot;n&quot; word and the stereotypes affected you: you got a little hot about it, or you didn't appreciate it, or you did appreciate it, or you thought it was funny. How did you react to that?And how did you react to the author as character in a novel? It rarely happens, but Vonnegut did it well, I think.

I hate to say it but I was not too impressed. I was hoping for a book that would be challenging. What I got was a book that used infantile humor in the guise of satire to try to impress the reader on just how clever the author is. If he has a main point, it seems to be that we are all empowered individuals and that all others are there to act as robots to interfere/interface with our lives. This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader. I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut's works."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I picked up Breakfast of Champions at a local used bookstore and I read the book not knowing quite what to expect. This isn't Vonnegut's best...but it most certainly isn't his worst.Breakfast of Champions isn't a philosophical book--it's just a book to read, to make you think a bit, but for the sake of precious time don't sit around and analyze it.Breakfast of Champions offers a somewhat accurate account of society, and I'll always admire Vonneguts satire and bitter realism but I think ol Kurt went a little too far with the whole &quot;bad chemicals&quot; situation--which became bothersome after several pages of this bleak denial of responsibility.Breakfast of Champions--a quick, humourous read (love those doodles), but nothing to take very seriously.~Leann~"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is the first Vonnegut book I have read, and I was blown away. 'Breakfast of Champions' definitely belongs among the list of books that will change the way you think about everything. On top of that, 'Breakfast' is a light meal that split my sides and made me burst out laughing more than once. Paradoxically, however, its subject is the meaning of the Universe, and you can't get much heavier than that.Read it in one sitting, and you won't regret it.

Sure, Kurt is self-indulging. That's why we like him. He is a moralist. This is a fine book that I would recommend to every person. It is hard to label one of KV's books the best. But if I were forced to do so, Breakfast of Champions would be the best."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut, master of the cynical, has written far, far better books than the largely overrated Breakfast of Champions. While the premise is a fantastic one, the actual execution is bad, paling when compared to better novels based on shoddier premises.The tale builds towards a climatic, gruesome finale...but that finale never comes. Maybe Vonnegut intended to mock readers who *wanted* to see a horrific ending? Possibly...all he suceeded in doing was ruining what could have been a great story. Toss in a wealth of useless drawings - a joke that grows stale after 30 pages or so - and you have a book that could have (and should have) been so much more.Much of Vonneguts beloved cynicism and wit is still there, the only reason for three stars, but in the end it falls short of what it could have been."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions has to be one of the wittiest and cleverest books I've ever read. Witty for the irrevent, and quite hilarous, first few chapters; clever for the way that the seemingly random plot elements fall together, and the ingenious way in which Vonnegut inserts himself into his own novel. (What would you do if you met your Creater? Ha!) This book doesn't have very much in the way of plot, but then, this is Vonnegut we're talking about here. The story here is really secondary to the social criticism that Vonnegut doles out. Here we get his views on many things (America, slavery, racism, pollution, sex, God) all woven into the story in a clever and entertaining way. Vonnegut has an odd way of keeping you reading, he's not a master of suspense per se, but his books are always hard to put down. For one thing, his prose is always clear and lucid, and the writing is extremely fast-paced, also he drops here and there hints of what is to come in the novel without actually spelling out the details. One would think this would make it pointless and useless to finish the book, but it has, in fact, the opposite effect. I highly reccommend Breakfast of Champions to anyone looking for a good, fast, and funny read, or to those who can appreciate something truly off-kilter."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I am a grade 11 student and I had to read this book for an assignment. It is the best book I have ever read and it kept my attention for the whole time. It was so good that I was tempted to read it for one whole day."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is certainly Vonnegut's most difficult books to digest. I believe that even he himself gave this book a C on his own grading scale, which tells you something. However, I actually enjoyed this book, from page one you can tell that this book is going to be very sarcastic and satirical. Perhaps the main problem here is that, unlike most of his novels, this one is not \\"timeless\\" meaning he uses language (especially the liberal use the the N word) that we find either distasteful, or just weird. I think Vonnegut actually intended this novel to offend rather than entertain, so if you find it entertaining, then you may either be a disgusting human being, or perhaps just one that can laugh at anything. I find myself in the latter category because I found this book rather amusing. However, I don't think this book will appeal to most people, and if you are new to Vonnegut, I wouldn't start with this. My only big gripe about this book is it lacks a functional ending. I mean, I guess I assumed since Vonnegut tells you the ending on the first page, that there would somehow be more to it, or a resolution, or just an anecdote; however, there really is none of that, in fact, its as if Vonnegut just got tired of writing or ran out of paper in his typewriter. Not for everyone, but for those select few, this book is amazing."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; follows the odyssey of oddball science fiction writer Kilgore Trout from his melancholy childhood in Bermuda, to the sleazy underside of New York City, and eventually to a fateful encounter with car dealer Wayne Hoover, a man &quot;on the brink of going insane.&quot; Within this framework Vonnegut weaves an amazing satiric tapestry that looks at racism, mental illness, environmental crises, the nature and function of art, and many other issues. The book is filled with Vonnegut's own quirky illustrations.&quot;Breakfast&quot; is harsh, even cruel, but also tender and compassionate; it's laugh-out-loud funny, yet haunting and tragic. It's also a reality-warping metaphysical triumph; Vonnegut breaks down the barriers between reality and fiction, and invites the reader into the very process of the novel's creation. He creates a more intimate bond between author, reader, and fictional character than any other writer I can think of.Vonnegut presents some of American literature's most memorable characters in &quot;Breakfast.&quot; But my favorite is undoubtedly Trout. Throughout the book we also get glimpses of Trout's own voluminous body of work, and meet some of his bizarre sci-fi characters. The book as a whole is also enriched by Vonnegut's unique style; he writes as if for an extraterrestrial audience to whom humanity is utterly alien.&quot;Breakfast&quot; is a profane, naughty, yet profoundly spiritual book. Filled with strange and vivid details, it's an oddly comforting modern-day testament for our fractured world. Thanks, Kurt."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut Jr. has specialized in two types of novels. The first types are made up of sharp, witty tales that poke fun at humanity, while all the time keeping one eye on the plot. Both SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE and MOTHER NIGHT are sterling examples.The second type of Vonnegut novel is awkward and unusual in the extreme, often leaving the reader dazed, thumping his or her head on the floor in a vain attempt at comprehension. They are enjoyable, but their precise meaning continues to elude. TIMEQUAKE is a fine example. BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is another.BREAKFAST, to define some semblance of a plot, follows two main story threads. In the first, Vonnegut presents us with Dwayne Hoover, car-salesman extrordinaire, who is slowly and surely losing his mind. In the second, we have Vonnegut regular Kilgore Trout, the unemployed and unlikable science-fiction writer, who is hitch-hiking his way across the country to recieve a sizable award at an arts convention.This is the plot, but Vonnegut adheres to it only in passing. In countless asides and divergences, Vonnegut explores sex, race, politics, sex, enviromental catastrophe, sex, aliens, robots, god, and sex. All this, plus numerous obscene doodles and an appearance from Vonnegut himself, bestowing wisdom upon his creations.What, exactly, is Vonnegut trying to say? American culture is a vast wasteland of imbecility? People are generally self-centred and greedy, and above all, not nice? As a culture, America is doomed to die in its own sewage? The answer to all would seem to be yes. Vonnegut has often had a core of anger in his writings, and BREAKFAST is perhaps his angriest.But BREAKFAST is not simply a gloomy discussion of the end of us all. Vonnegut is far too wise to dwell on man's foibles for long. He continues on his merry way, drawing our attention to this event and that one, all the while reminding us that perhaps Dwayne Hoover is correct: We ARE all robots, grinding our gears, fulfilling our functions, not considering any sorts of consequences.An astonishing thing has just happened: While penning this review, I realized just how much I enjoyed the book. It was confusing, bizarre, and often irritating. But many of Vonnegut's themes have remained in my consciousness, continuing to dispense nuggets of thought to my often-addled brain. If that isn't the mark of a memorable novel, I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Is it possible to say anything new about a book that has been in print for ~30 years, that has been read by millions, and which is widely studied in schools and universities?No... but I do want to say that I loved every word (and illustration). You can pick up this old novel and get a very fresh outlook both on the human condition and on how novels ought to be written.Vonnegut writes like he is explaining life on Earth to alien children. It is a tool that produces incredibly poignant satire, which he uses effectively to give commentary on conditions of life that the vast majority of us accept without even noticing. The language used is very simple but wonderfully lyrical, less-than-average readers will fly right through it.Although clearly sadenned by his life, and by his observations of the planet, Vonnegut wrote a masterpiece that remains hopeful in its despair.Kurt Vonnegut is a genius, and will no doubt be recognized as one of the 20th Century's greatest."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I learned tonight of Kurt Vonnegut's passing, at age 84. I immediately thought of this book, Breakfast of Champions, as the quintessential Vonnegut novel -- not just for what is on the page, but moreso for what it meant to me, especially when I read it for the first time so many years ago.It was 1979, just six years after he wrote Breakfast, and I was 15, a callow and precocious and dependable and rebellious lad, all at once in those crazy mid-adolescent years. And no one's words spoke quite as eloquently or directly to my fevered brain as did this aging, iconoclastic, sublimely inventive and imaginative author. He was only two years older than my father, and yet light years different in terms of his world view and humor. And to me, this out-of-left-field novel, about banal, blase and boring car salesman Dwayne Hooper and his sudden awakening and transformation into someone so much more complex, is brilliant absudist humor.I think even the oft-derided cartoon drawings Vonnegut peppers his writings with -- and he uses them liberally throughout Breakfast -- work to perfection here. Vonnegut's drawings deftly set the tone and constantly remind the reader that this is not the overstuffed, pretentious stuff of Mailer or Vidal or any of Vonnegut's other contemporaries.Re-reading Breakfast a few years ago, I couldn't help but think that an adolescent of today might consider the style almost quaint, considering how much snark and absurdist humor has permeated popular culture over the last 20 or 30 years. To some, I guess the discerning minority, it would be as powerful today as it was more than 30 years ago. There is humor that makes you laugh, and then there are works that also make you think and help expand your horizons to boot. To me, Breakfast of Champions is that kind of brilliance.I found it deliciously ironic that it was my father's copy of Breakfast that I had swiped all those many years ago, a copy he never opened as far as I know, but a copy that still sits in my library to this day. I loved my father then as I do now, but at age 15 was discovering (as all boys do) that he was not the perfect hero I imagined when I was 6 or 7. Reading Vonnegut's brilliant, out-there work helped put in stark relief that there were so many different ideas and experiences and universes than the suburbia in which I'd grown up. And that was fine by me. Farewell, Kurt, and thanks for sharing your brilliance; I for one will miss it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Although not his most popular work, this is in my opinion Vonnegut's most brilliant novel. Superficially it seems childish, with it's inane illustrations (by the author) and rambling, seemingly unstructured text. But probe a little deeper and some truly profound insights emerge, and there is litle doubt that this is a work of carefully crafted, absolute genius.There are at least four main themes in this book, and the way Vonnegut weaves them together is both masterful and unorthodox. (In no particular order) the first theme is of madness - Dwayne Hoover has finally fallen victim to the chemicals in his brain, and much of the narrative unfolds around his descent into lunacy and violence. The second theme is that of the alienation of modern-day life, as a despairing Kilgore Trout makes his &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; across small-town USA, and Wayne Hoobler spends the novel waiting pathetically for his dreams to come true while standing by a Holiday Inn dumpster. The third theme is on the meaning of all art, both in Rabo Karabekian's stunning exposition on modern painting, and on Vonnegut's own musings about the point of writing a novel (which occurs within the narrative).And the final theme, binding it all together, is that of love and connection. As is found in many of Vonnegut's works, he argues that the giving and receiving of love is the only thing that makes our otherwise meaningless lives valuable. Many people miss this point when they read Vonnegut, and hence come away feeling Vonnegut is a very bitter man. If you see this, you'll discover he is actually a deeply compassionate one.I have read this book many times, and each time come away with a new insight. Read it and treasure it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is the \\"Mad Magazine\\" Vonnegut, and if you have little use for that particular publication then you should read Player Piano or Slaughterhouse 5 instead of this book. The plot is quite simple on the face of it, a man going mad and the people he interacts with at a particular moment in time. The subplot is the authors musings on \\"life, the universe, and everything and how he is making a \\"balls\\" out of writing the novel your reading.It's a damned clever idea, and it works quite well, even if the author didn't seem to think so at the time. Much has been said about the \\"babytalk\\" and crude drawings that fill the book, one gets a sence that the author is going through a chardic experience while writing the book, ( as Vonnegut admits himself to one of the major charaters in the book at the end, ), this chardic experience we share with the author as we seemingly experience along with him a \\"suprise\\" ending that was forshadowed virtually from the opening page...we see the end playing out as outlined but as events often do, they sprial out of the authors hand and drag the story to unplanned and unexpected events. Vonnegut himself seems to loose control of the situation towards the end, but he quickly re asserts himself for the final few pages in a funny yet profound way.The book is a product of it's times, I call it a product of my times because I grew up in the period. In many ways the world has changed dramatically since then, so some observations tend to \\"jar\\" younger readers, like Mark Twain at his creative best, he is a mirror of his times, and as such some fine social satire is lost to modern audiences.Mr. Vonnegut uses some mild \\"bad language\\" in the book, as much to make fun of the subject as to mildly shock the reader. this is in the same sort of vein as a George Carlin comedy routine and not because the author actually believes such terms should be used to offend someone..indeed, he uses these \\"offensive terms\\" in such a way to remove their \\"special power\\" they have over our language...they color the dialog in a disarming way, which only the most skilled of writers can acomplish.Breakfast of Champions is more than a 50'th birthday present for the author, it is a gift from him to us as a reader. This book is so many things skillfully blended together in satire and witt that I doub't even the author can list them all, which is a good thing really, since it keeps us comming back for the ocasional read years after we first experienced his work the first time.This is on my shortlist of great \\"novels\\", this is a book I would never let leave my library unless it takes a place next to my chair or bedside...if you find Monty Python funny, George Carlin a great social commentator, and Mark Twain a master of the written word you should like this book, but read it at face value first before you search for hidden meanings and rye observations, and it will soon be something you will savor again again in repeated readings."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book really isn't about the story so much as it is about criticizing society. The satire is way more important than the story. In fact, there isn't much of a plot here. He often totally leaves it to be satirical, creating a very minor character or the plot of a book written by Kilgore Trout to do this. He does it very well, but is not one for subtlety; in most isntances it is very obvious what he is trying to say. However, I dare you not to laugh at some of the shots he takes at society.I found his writing style annoying as the novel began, though I adapted. He is too cynical at some points, and too condesceding in others. I did laugh a lot, though.A mistake I made was that this was the first novel I read by Vonnegut. I should have read Slaughterhouse-Five first (it is better and a good introduction to him). I did read it after, and am planning on reading Cat's Cradle soon enough.I definitely would recommend this novel, but you may want to introduce yourself to Vonnegut before you do."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I remember when Breakfast of Champions first came out and I rushed to buy it in hardcover. I'd been a fan of Kurt Vonnegut's since I'd first read Slaughterhouse 5 and Cats Cradle. In fact, Slaughterhouse 5 was then my favorite book of all time and I was sure no other book would ever surpass it at the pinnacle of my list of favorites. I dove into the pages of Breakfast of Champions and my initial response was \\"huh?\\" At the age of 16 I just couldn't get into the story of a writer who turns 50 and sets free one of his literary creations.Now that I'm 50 (plus a couple more) and Vonnegut has passed on, Breakfast of Champions rates higher than Slaughterhouse 5 on my personal list. Every time I've gone back and read Breakfast of Champions I picked up something new from it. At the age of 16 I thought the funniest thing in the book of the pen and ink drawing of Vonnegut's representation of the business end of the alimentary canal. Now instead of laughing out loud at the parts I think are funny, I tend to smile and nod in recognition of observations this master satirist and preeminent humanist makes.Far from being just a story about a writer, the sci-fi novelist he creates and a car salesman whose chance meeting with his fellow fictional character sets him down a path of madness, Breakfast of Champions is the story of how we sometimes grow older without growing up. It's a tale that captures the Zeitgeist of the 1970s in the same way that Tom Wolfe captured the '80s in Bonfire of the Vanities ... except that Wolfe used far more words and failed to include a single drawing of an anus in his book.Yet despite it's setting in the Me Decade/disco era of the '70s, the characters of Kilgore Trout, Dwayne Hoover and even Mr. Vonnegut himself would fit in quite nicely with our current time as they did back then when I thought Breakfast of Champions was only about men growing old and going a little nuts."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is a book that is so full of strange ideas, altered realities, and different perceptions that it's a little like reading a nervous breakdown at times. There is so much going on, that you may find yourself going back and reading a page three or four times just to pull everything that you can out of it. And just when you think it can't get any more insane, Kurt Vonnegut places the author of the book into the story-line itself as the Creator Of The Universe, but goes out of his way to give this author a name different to his own. Confusing? Yes. Enjoyable? Absolutely.This book covers a wide range of topics. Racism, sexism, mental imbalance, chemistry, life, death, and literally hundreds of other subjects are discussed. The plot is set out in a very simple way so that Vonnegut has room to let his characters and himself entertain a variety of thoughts. The prose of the book is very detailed about the most mundane of material. Vonnegut can cleverly point to the absurdity of everyday things, merely by describing them in minute terms without resorting to overbearing judgments. By just reducing everything to its most basic components, he can show the flaws present in the most basic of fundamentals.This minutiae even extends to the basics of story telling. By placing &quot;the author&quot; inside the fictional narrative, Vonnegut can point out some of the fundamentals of writing. Since no detail about a person is inherently more important than any other, there are times were we get an information dump of seemingly random information about the characters in the story. The question that comes to mind: is all of this information really irrelevant? If the author saw fit to include it, does it matter that the data doesn't relate to the narrative?In summary, it's almost impossible to summarize most, or even much, of what Kurt Vonnegut has written about here. This is such a very densely written book that it would take twice the length of BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS in order to talk about it properly. And even with all of the ideas and thoughts contained within, the book never feels bloated or incoherent. It's philosophical, entertaining, bizarre, thought-provoking and hilarious.It's good. Highly recommended. Rush out and read it now."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Never before have I read a book that so much wanted to drive me irrevocably insane. If you have tasted some of Vonnegut's other works and have enjoyed them, then read this. It's certainly my favourite, out of all the great books in his collection.In it Dwayne Hoover, owner of a luxury car dealership in Midland City, is slowly going insane. He is on a crash-course towards bloody violence, mitigated by Kilgore Trout - writer of psychotic science-fiction tales. In his almost juvenile, simplistic prose, Vonnegut takes us on a harrowing ride through the mind of two lunatics, bouncing off the peripheral characters like murderous pinballs.So, if you've acclimatized yourself to the utter genius of Kurt Vonnegut, then read on. If not, then perhaps it's best to test the waters first with his other works. You may never be the same again."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Dude, this novel completes screws your mind! People are robots! The environment is collapsing! The author is a character who knows he's writing the novel he's in! Post-modern? You bet!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Have you ever thought that you were the only sentient being on earth? That everyone else was an automaton designed to test your reactions? That history and events in faraway places were simply constructs intended to cause you puzzlement or momentarily pique your interest? That there were far too many coincidences in this life to ignore forever the workings of a omnipotent (and quite possibly insane) Creator &amp; Instigator?Vonnegut wrote CHAMPIONS as a birthday present to himself and he takes the opportunity to meditate at length on what it means to &quot;play God&quot; during the act of writing. He pushes his characters around the middle American landscape of his mind, devises horrible, dull, or joyous fates for them, and salutes them as they endure all his torments and whimsy.This is one of those books that can change your life. I read it when I was 14 or 15, and then read it again 4 or 5 times. I suppose I wanted to make certain that I had soaked up every ounce of divine madness in the book. I had read SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE previously, but this book set me off on a Vonnegut rampage, I devoured everything he wrote in a matter of months. CHAMPIONS opened my mind to the idea of &quot;writer as Creator.&quot;"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is great in that although written 30 years ago,and Vonnegut was satirizing things from back then,it still holds up. At first,I found the narrative a bit pedantic but then it really started to work for me. \\"Hardly(anything) is sacred\\",Vonnegut writes in the foreward.,and while reading his pot-shots of all things (absurdly) American you realize he's right. One of the best satires that I've ever come across.."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In this book, Kurt Vonnegut creates one of the best anti-heroes, anti-materialist semi-biographical sketches of all time. Kilgore Trout, the man who first appears lost with no direction, actually has more direction than most in that he consciously relfects upon the machine-like states of numerous biologically functioning humans in modern society. He realizes the muck run awash from environmental degradation, money corrupting one's rational sense of decision-making, the tearing apart of relationship factors to hollowly artificial replacement products and excesses.Kilgore Trout, the disaffecting roaming nomad lost in the confusion of bureaucratic machinery. Dwayne Hoover the careless, heartless spendthrift of a millionaire. Wayne Hobler, the out of prison, miseducated, schizofrenically confused trounsed upon carpet mat. All these are stereotypical American representations, but the thing that Vonnegut makes so great is that he reveals these characteristics not by blatantly pointing them out, but by putting us in their place as he has done with his alter-ego Kilgore Trout, and making possible to visualize the lunacy that abounds amoung these out-of-balance &quot;chemical machines.&quot;Truly, a great read to poke fun at the zombie-like characteristics of modern day daily life. Puts a dose of satirical humanity onto the inhumane confusion and languishings of modern society."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Many times one reads a book for an intricate plot and brilliant character development. Breakfast of Champions does not quite live up to these conditions, but it is the amazing wit and poignancy of Vonnegut which really makes this book a must read. Whether it is about racial prejudice, economic lust, the problems with American society, or simply the stupidity and ridiculousness of the average person's life, Vonnegut has something to say. As an American who knows what it is like to live in a society that is overwhelmed by ignorance and greed, I advise those who have not realized the true state of the country to read this book and to contemplate their previous beliefs. Social satire is utilized at its best in this worthwhile book which I recommend wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I purchased this novel after finishing Cat's Cradle, another Vonnegut novel. Cat's Cradle was the most enlightening and thought provoking thing I've ever experienced, and somehow Breakfast of Champions has topped it. This has been the most amazing piece of literature I've come across, breaking all the rules of &quot;clear thoughts, obvious direction, and plot&quot;. This book has none of these unless you want to think it does, and is basically random thoughts from Vonnegut's head. If you've ever wanted to know what it was like to crawl in someone else's brain, this is the book for you. Discursive but not in a rambling manner, Vonnegut hits a homerun with Breakfast Of Champions."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"this was the first of vonnegut's novels that i read, and i can safely say after reading a few more of his books, that breakfast of champions is truly the quintessential vonnegut. while his other books are all wonderful reads, this book is simply his most powerful work, in terms of social commentary and his own brand of keen wit and sarcastic brilliancy. this novel touches on many relevant topics and at times i was in fact blown away. i don't understand how some other reviewers could criticize this book, unless they simply took it for it's face value and failed to open their minds as to the genius layed out within its pages. i would definitely recommend this book to any fans of great contemporary literature."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut is simply outstanding, he writes with a clarity and honesty which is exhilirating. His greatest charm is the nearly child like way he sees the world, and this is one of his finest works. A humourous and intelligent sideways look at modern life, a must read book."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"American narcissism can be very blinding. Only a few critics see that Andy Warhol's art deals with something more than American consumerism and pop-culture. Kurt Vonnegut's book is only in part an anathema to American provincial life.If you want to experience Zen stripped of it's Oriental trappings do not miss Breakfast for Champions.Just like Andy Warhol, Rusin by birth, Vonnegut is an outsider to the American culture. He takes the items of everyday life, choosing these with the maximum layers of idiosyncrasy - used car yards, KFC joints, Holiday Inns - and regals them with the extraterrestrial's stare.We are born and raised with a certain mental molding, we see the things as they are supposed to be seen. Then something happens. You see hundreds of Marilyn Monroe's faces in Warhol's painting and the pop icon becomes a weird combination of dots, lines and shades. You read Vonnegut and see his drawings of the most familiar objects - and they become as unearthly as Nasca reliefs.When I had my satori I rode a bus and suddenly became aware of the weird flesh formations on the sides of a fellow passenger's head. Only a part of my brain was storing the name for that phenomenon - &quot;ears&quot;. The rest of me was just looking.All the happenings in the book are just an excuse for showing you that stare. It is an American province, but could be Nairobi slums or Danish boyscout camp. The prose is detached, laconical. If you are looking for &quot;funny&quot; parts you'll find them. But that would be entirely your fault."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Three stars is a good rating for me. Rarely do I give 4 or more. That said, I thought the first 2/3 of this book was absolutely hysterical. Yes, it was juvenile. Yes, it was even infantile at times, but it was fun. If you're looking for a light hearted read, and you like satire, then this is the book for you. Vonnegut has the ability to make us laugh at what we are, when most would waddle in the misery and wretchedness of human behavior. A WARNING: this is not a book for the politically correct."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I think what stands the most about this book, after all these years, is the intrepid, and literal, author intrusion throughout the story. Vonnegut's cameo character near the end was both unpredictible and welcomed. Truly a brilliant book--and one of the few I truly blame for getting me to write my own. --Darren Jame"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut is a crazy old man. All of his books are related in some way or another. It will be a character in the book that was talked about previously as if he was gossiping. He never really has a plot to any of his stories but they are always immensly entertaining. In Breakfast of Champions he tells a story of a car salesman whos wife kills herself and he ends up going crazy. This is a book you will not want to set down till you finish. But the shorter chapters make it to where you can read it without too much of a problem.."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"BUY IT.READ IT.REPEAT.-- MORE RELEVANT AND MUCH FUNNIER THAN THE BIBLE."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"After reading Cat's Cradle, I was very excited to read another Vonnegut title. After reading the many rave reviews of Breakfast of Champions I decided this would be an interesting choice. I was very disappointed. The only reason I even finished it was because it was an easy, short read plus I wanted to be able to write a review taking the whole book into consideration. First, it is not funny. I am befuddled as to how so many people found it funny. It just isn't. Sure, there are a couple of somewhat funny comments but these are very few and far between. Basically all he does is criticize our American society which I do not find offensive but he does it in such a direct, in-your-face style that it doesn't resonate with any humor. It is like he just put down on paper some random thoughts and complaints about our society without putting any effort toward creating a cohesive theme. The storyline itself is so fragmented and superficial and pock-marked with useless anecdotes and comments that after the first 50 pages I really lost all interest.Now for the pictures. He decided to draw pictures of everyday things that we all are familiar with such as a cow and a hamburger. Now at first these were a bit humerous but after the first dozen or so they were very tedious and useless. I found myself thinking \\"Yes Kurt, I know what a cow looks like\\". I understand that he is pretending to be writing this commentary on our society to someone who is not familiar with our world in order to highlight it's contradictions, ironies and hypocrosies which are often times right under our noses but the pictures just got to be too much. I finally concluded he used them just for filler for his very thin story.There was also a lot of derogatory comments about African-Americans which obviously offended some readers but he also has other vulgar comments as well and these, I believe, were all included to do just that: be offensive and vulgar for no other real purpose because it sure didn't add anything to the story such as it is.I have not given up on Vonnegut however. I plan on reading a few more of his novels but if they are anything like this one then I'm through with him. Cat's Cradle was so much more funny, smart, well-conceived and subtle yet strong in it's message that I can't believe the same person wrote both but hey, I guess you can't hit a homerun every time and with Breakfast of Champions he certainly strikes out as far as I am concerned. Of note, the author himself states in the book that it is a bad book so there you have it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"years ago, on NPR i believe, i heard someone put this book down as an exception to vonnegut's otherwise fine books. I felt stupid hearing that, because i always thought this was my 2nd favorite vonnegut book (after slaugherhouse-five). so I went back and read it again, and I WAS RIGHT; this is my 2nd favorite vonnegut book. and this is a very funny book, if you have a mind tuned to the finer, darker, dryer side of humor, that is. people without a very keen sense of humor will probably not get it, it is above them. or rather their brains will not tune in the frequency on which this kind of humour rides. anyway, this is a great book, which needs no synopsis rehash here from me. if you have a discriminating sense of humor & a weariness with the way people are handling this earth, then this is a must for your soul."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I first read this in 1997 at the age of 25 and thought this book was funny and brilliant. I reread it again a few days ago and now think that it is just \\"pretty good\\". It seems dated in some areas and in others it does not seem very \\"deep\\" at all. For instance Vonnegut gives this very childish definition of capitalism as being very unfair and communism as being the most rational form of an economy. He wants us to think that if we all looked at complex social processes like children we would all see that we should switch to communism because everyone shares (even though everyone including Vonnegut himself) should know that this is impossible. I also do not understand why he keeps on telling me the measurements of some of his characters. Maybe it was funny 8 years ago but after he does this in the novel twice it is no longer really funny and he gives measeurements of characters about 30-40 times. If you are under 30 years old and politically liberal you will love this book otherwise I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is marvelous. It completely changed the way I look at literature and life in general.

Breakfast of Champions, though, was self-indulgent, insubtle, rambling drivel that does not deserve any of the applause which people have so eagerly and richly supplied it with. The attempted irony in the book is distorted and monstrously misapplied. I groaned at each new meaningless illustration or transparent and overwrought attempt at novel, unorthodox narration. The whole book is directed at the lowest common denominator. Style over substance. I admire Vonnegut, and have enjoyed his other works, but Breakfast of Champions belongs in the same trash bin with A Prayer for Owen Meany (John Irving's only garbage novel, yet it is tremendously loved)."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut's anti-modern world narcissism is a boring journey into little minds.

The robotic characters exhale amazing deterministic brilliance throughout the novel. Vonnegut himself says that it delves into his insanity and possible schizophrenia. Indeed it is very bizarre because large sections of it (ie. the last 100 pages) seem to be written on an acid trip. It has times of laugh-out-loud humor and moments of horrific atrocities. Overall this book should be read and displayed proudly on any Vonnegut fan's bookshelf, it is clearly one of his best works."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut writes spectacular stories every time and this is no exception. The illustrations are hilarious and the black humor is vintage Vonnegut. An interesting storyline: A lunatic starts believing a science fiction writer's works.

It really gets you thinking. Kilgore Trout is the most interesting character I've ever read about. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Reading the average review of Breakfast of Champions, one gets the impression that this book must be at once uproariously funny, incisive in its social critism, and deeply philosophical. In truth, none of the above are even remotely applicable.Like Mark Twain, whom Vonnegut has often been likened to, Vonnegut's humor is largely based on tongue-in-cheek irreverence of the &quot;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; variety. The idea is to write a social critique from the perspective of a naive or unbiased outsider who is supposedly able to see things more clearly than everybody else. The outsider goes around pretending 'unwittingly' to expose absurdities, prejudices, and hypocrisy underlying various social conventions.The outsider in Breakfast of Champions is a narrator who writes about Earthlings as if he were an intergalactic traveller. The irreverent statements he makes are supposed to shock hypocrites, while those who are in-the-know titter away at the spectacle. Concerning power politics, for instance, Vonnegut writes: &quot;[America] disciplined other countries by threatening to shoot big rockets at them or to drop things on them from airplanes.&quot; About racism he declares: &quot;A Nigger was a human being who was black.&quot;Are you tittering?The 'philosophical' content of Breakfast of Champions, like the social commentary, is shallow and presented with a singular lack of eloquence; unlike the social commentary, it is incoherent rather than simplistic. The narrator is mainly concerned with the principle of determinism and how it relates to mental health, and the main characters in the novel serve as personifications of different aspects of this dilemma. Dwayne Hoover, a car dealer from the midwest, goes crazy after reading a novel by Kilgore Trout, a pessimistic science fiction writer. The novel is in the form of a letter from the Creator to the only person on the planet with free will. Hoover, already losing his marbles at the time of reading the story, takes it literally, and ends up injuring some of the other characters whom, in his orgy of solipsism, he has dismissed as &quot;machines&quot;.The 'clever' reader is supposed to notice that the relationship between the Creator and the man with free will in Trout's novel is, on one level, an allegory of the relationship between a writer and the characters he creates. This is alluded to with increasing frequency until Vonnegut himself jumps into the novel to wreak havoc with the allegorical 'levels'. After being 'enlightened' via a speech by one of his characters about &quot;awareness&quot;, Vonnegut tells the rest of the story about the Trout/Hoover encounter which personifies the author's personal triumph over madness.Vonnegut's intent seems to have been to show that though &quot;awareness&quot; is not a sufficient premise for free will, it nevertheless distances us from the spectre of determinism by implying that we are more than simply biological machinery. The concept is not tremendously profound, and that is probably why Vonnegut goes to such lengths to obfuscate the issue with ambiguous and/or conflicting statements throughout the novel. Of course he might be just writing carelessly.I have heard it proposed that the apparent incoherence of the novel is intentional in order to forestall any global interpretation of the book. People who support this view gleefully maintain that the point IS that there is NO point. This type of person will generally follow these remarks with something about how literature is written to evoke, not to explain; how the person searching for a 'purpose' in literature shows a fundamental lack of comprehension of what literature is.... And so on.Breakfast of Champions is tasteless &quot;trash&quot; (I am quoting Vonnegut's own appraisal of the book on p.6 - for once his bluntness is entirely apt), fortified with heaps of smug pretentiousness. If you can stomach this sort of junk, have it your way; for a real literary meal, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"These books are cynical college-kid favorites. Its fun to read this book and go \\"yeah, society is stupid just like he says\\" but its a very narrow point of view. The book takes little bits of truth and distributes them as if they were the only information tid-bits available.Despite this the book is funny and entertaining to read. It makes numerous good, funny points and but carries with it a sick sense of despair at all humans that leaves a bad taste in your mouth about everything, including the novel itself."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I was shock when i saw who many one star reviews there are. It didn't shock me why they gave it one star. They are the people who don't points in the pointless, and the humor in the frankness.

The reason why this book is so good, is the same reason with all of Kurt Vonnegut's books, its the characters."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is probably one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read. The ability of the author to go back and forth between characters seemlessley is impeccable and can never be duplicated by another.The idea behind Breakfast of Champions is a conflict between two main characters, Kilgore Trout & Dwayne Hoover, both with seemingly separate lives and completely different views on life, but once their paths are crossed, their lives change forever.In the beginning, a description of the characters are offered with extensive background information all leading up to their lives at the present and how in some way, shape, or form, they both rely on eachother for sanity. The author then goes even further to describe how their present life predicaments are affecting their outlooks on life and their performence both sexually and mentally are changing with every breath they take.Vonnegut goes back and forth between voices, a pious & omniscient figure to becoming either both or one of the main characters, al done seemlessly and impeccably.Kilgore Trout writes stories that the author comes up with which are then transduced as being sources of porographic ideas and Dwayne Hoover is a man who is beoming more and more psychotic everyday, he is losing his grip on reality and with the coming of Kilgore Trout to an art convention that Dwayne is also attending, Trout's stories, specifically one about all people being pre-set robots, causes Dwayne to snap and go on a rampage harming those who are most closest to him as well as people who need to be harmed, but still have no right to be harmed by Dwayne.If anything, this book is a masterpiece and a work of art and I would recommend this book to all whose mind is as twisted and confusing as the author's, as well as someone who can put up with consistent references to the male genitalia, as grotesque as it might become."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut is an American treasure, and Breakfast of Champions is a litterary gem. I can unquestionably say that this book change the way that I view novels as a whole and writers in general. Vonnegut is the captain of the crazy ship of joy and he's taking us along for the ride."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"A friend of mine said this was his favorite by Vonnegut so I read his copy. Personally, I was very disappointed. I read this one after Galapagos and thought Galapagos was far more engrossing."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"indeed this is the best anything ever (hence best book ever, man). i choose my close friends with this book. i give it to chums and if they like it, they are in, and if they don't, they are decidedly robots full of bad chemicals.vonnegut tells you to listen: we are all robots. face it. you are a robot! you may say (and i can hear you now) that vonnegut is cynical for suggesting such a thing. but he is just being honest about our preposterous existence, and if you think that facing up to the truth is cynical, then it is you who is looking at reality in a bad light.vonnegut is probably laughing and laughing about something silly right now. he is a beautiful robot. i wish he was my friend. i don't know if i've mentionned it already, but this is the best anything ever (even better than the anteater's snout). i kid ye not. word."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Let me start by saying that I already had my doubts about Vonnegut. I've already admitted that I could never get into Slaughterhouse-Five, and while I'd not given it as many tries, Cat's Cradle didn't do anything for me either. So why, one might ask, did I pick up yet another Vonnegut? It was more than just a burst of misguided optimism - I got a solid recommendation from a trusted source (Paul Dail) who claimed that this one was different and had influenced him a great deal. It was, in fact, one of the ten books that had the biggest influence on him as a writer, and a number of his other choices were books that I also enjoyed a great deal. Plus it was actually about a writer and the gestalt between writer and character. And if that doesn't total a solid recommendation, I don't know what does...Well, Paul, I have good news and bad news.First the good. I actually finished this one. So right off the bat you achieved what no one else has ever been able to - you got me through Vonnegut. And I did really dig the whole writer-writes-himself-into-the-story thing - Vonnegut himself plays a role (and not entirely minor, either) in the story.Now, unfortunately, the bad. And this part will be a tish longer. And it requires me to attempt to give you a brief synopsis of the book first, to make sure anyone who hasn't read it can follow where I go. If you have never read Vonnegut, you may be confused by that last bit - \\"attempt to give you a brief synopsis\\". I mean, who can't give a synopsis of a story they've read, right? Well, Vonnegut doesn't really write stories quite that straightforwardly, so the synopsis isn't as easy as all that. I will do my best though - and anyone (like Paul) who happens to have read the book and to have something to add that either (a) I missed, or (b) makes the story seem a bit more logical, should feel free to add it to the comments!In short, the book is about an author (Kilgore Trout) and a reader (Dwayne Hoover). Hoover invites Trout to town for a \\"cultural festival\\" - as Trout makes his way to town, Hoover descends into insanity, largely due to Trout's books. Much mayhem ensues. A slew of other characters are introduced. Vonnegut himself appears on occasion, full of snark and piss and vinegar. Oh yeah, and line drawings. Yup, the book is sprinkled with Vonnegut's drawings throughout. They are intended to illustrate the story. Mostly they just seem to emphasize the randomness.I'm sure a better reader than I could come up with a better synopsis, full of in-depth analysis and literary meaning. The book was written in the 1970s and it's entirely possible that I just am not in the spirit of the times enough to get it's all-over-the-place-ness. Or maybe it's just not that great a book. Who knows. Whatever the reason, it didn't resonate with me. Sure, I enjoyed a few parts of it; Vonnegut is clever and every now and then throws out a pearl of insight, laden with cynicism and bitter wisdom. But on the whole, it felt disjointed and kind of pointless. And that's the biggest disappointment of all.I wanted to like this one. I really did. I liked the way other people talked about this book, I liked the premise - the interaction between author and obsessed reader, the interposition of the author into the story, the idea of an author who thinks he writes crap when other people think he is some sort of prophet. I wanted to like the bits of \\"art\\" scattered throughout the story, the very randomness I had a hard time following. But I just didn't. It felt like that kind of bizarre seventies crap that I have always found self-indulgent and overly pleased with itself - the kind that doesn't make sense and is proud that it doesn't.Again I offer the following: maybe I am just not the right kind of reader - for this genre or for Vonnegut. Who knows. Regardless, I think it's safe to say that I'm done with Vonnegut. I managed to get through one entire book, so I am comfortable saying that now. So if nothing else, thanks for that Paul!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"when i think about the fact that someone i care about has not read this book, i almost start to cry. when i think about the fact that an ex-girlfriend of mine may have the opportunity to read this book, i start to cringe. chances are, i don't know who you are, but i love vonnegut so much for writing this book that i want him to get as much money as he can from you and anyone else. best book ever written."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I loved The Sirens of Titan when I'd read it. The central idea behind the book - that the search for meaning might end somewhere disappointing - was fascinating and fun to explore. I've loved books in a similar vein. James Morrow was one of my favorite authors, and I'd love to re-read \\"City of Truth\\" some time. I've also grown accustomed - and even learned to enjoy - since I first saw Night of the Living Dead as an adolescent going on teenager, to authors hiding behind their work to sometimes throw stones or sometimes just raspberry the world around them. Probably my favorite part of every Twilight Zone episode is the small, universal, fun messages behind the show that you just can't help but agree with in spite of everything. And what episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents would be complete without Alfred's own dry wit? As you can tell, my taste in entertainment predates me by quite a few years. What I'm trying to say, is that by all rights I should have liked this book.So I went into this, expecting an entertaining premise I could follow. Ideas I could chew on. Plot I could try to understand. Characters I could care about. \\"And so on\\". And maybe with a healthy shaking of Vonnegut's own wit, wisdom, and voice, like salt and pepper on a baked potato. To stretch the analogy a little further, I was even prepared for a bit of raunchy sour cream.What I got was salt, pepper, sour cream, butter, and no potato.The book was written in 1973, I told myself. These ideas weren't quite so hackneyed and done. Sure it felt like reading a Garfield strip, but back then even Jim Davis' unique brand of humor would have been futuristic and edgy. The world must have been a simpler, more innocent place back then. It just had to be.I told myself similar things every time I was told which political philosophies to subscribe to, pressing issues to care about, \\"and so on\\". I reminded myself that maybe these concepts were flying in the face of an unchallenged status quo back then. I'm even now refusing to create a model to check these assumptions against reality. I'm refusing to look up on Wikipedia how long Nixon had been President already in 1973. I don't want to know whether this was before or after George Carlin was arrested. I've got a comfortable fiction protecting me from hating Mr Vonnegut, the man that's given us so much better than this, and I'm happy there.But I've made it four chapters. Maybe it'll be fun reading what other people reviewing the book have to say about Mr Hoover's antics and how people close to him like this Bunny character I've heard about react. I'm throwing a book away, intentionally. Not just putting it on my bookcase lying to myself about reading it some day. I can't get a refund, but honestly, I don't want one; there is a good chance that, should I return the audio book to the store I bought it from, it would end up on the shelf where someone else might buy it, and I don't want that on my conscience.What I'm saying, is that I'm genuinely happy for you if you enjoyed the book. But I obviously didn't, and seeing as how Mr Vonnegut made it a point to let us know he has no intention of pulling punches, I don't think it would be right for me to do so either."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This was my first Vonnegut experience, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed...I've got a lot of the book marked with parts I especially loved. I'm going to read plenty more of his stuff now too. This is probably one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read literally thousands of books. It's easy to read, but the story and the premise are a little unusual. That's one of my favorite things about it. If you've never read Vonnegut, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"my first vonnegut read and a refreshing surprise. this book had me crying laughing"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Purely and simply the funniest book I have ever read, however be prepared for some pretty extreme racism. But don't worry there are plenty of little treats in this one for everybody. I promise you will \\"laugh out load\\" at least five times. At least. It was the softer side to this story that I was not expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless and turned the book into a true masterpiece. What caught my eye is when Vonnegut places himself into the story and talks about his suicidal mother, and his farewell to Kilgore Trout at the end which is surprisingly emotional, but wickedly fun. Here is a sneak preview of a passage I want to share with you that grabbed me when I read it.(which is thrown in very unexpectedly I might add)\\"This is a very bad book you're writing,\\" I said to myself behind my leaks.(glasses) \\"I know,\\" I said. \\"You're afraid you'll kill yourself the way your mother did,\\" I said. \\"I know,\\" I said.This is Vonnegut letting loose some pretty dark demons in his life at the time. He wrote this book as a gift to himself for his 50th birthday. And for all the great fiction he has written over the years that we have grown to love, that passage was his heart and soul, not fiction. I guess he needed to get that off his chest.I'm glad he did.And so on.Anyway, this is without a doubt a great book on many different levels (if you can get by the racism) from beginning to end. I loved it. Oh, I almost forgot, the pictures are great too.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This was an odd book. The author introduces himself as a character in his book about 2/3 of the way through and gives away the ending to his own story. Bizarre to say the least, and at first glance, I was inclined to think of it as a cheap narrative device, particularly after reading Cat's Cradle, which was a fantastic story. However, I came to realise that the author *was* a part of the story, offering his views and emotions on subjects as widely-varying as American intervention in wars overseas (he might as well have been writing about Iraq), death of family members, insanity, one's mortality, sex. And so on. The author is himself a part of the story with much to add on these topics, but he relegates himself to a secondary role behind Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover.The most notable character to me, though, was Zog, the farting and tap dancing space alien. WTF?"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book has a lot of extremely offensive language. Once you get past that, the story is a wonderful mix of humor and real human insight. It helped me appreciate life.I highly recommend watching it WITH the movie--like, read the book, then immediately watch the movie, then watch the movie again while holding the book in front of you. It's even better if you can listen to the Flaming Lips at the same time. No, really, I'm serious, try it!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; was Kurt Vonnegut's birthday present to himself as he reached the half-century mark. How gracious of him to share this purging with the reading public. Dark, disturbing, and hilarious, this novel stands among the finest of the previous century. Courage. Bravo, Mr. Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut has always been a very interesting writer. The pinnacle of his unpredictability was his 1973 novel, Breakfast of Champions. Vonnegut created two complex characters, Kilgore Trout and Dwanye Hoover. Kilgore Trout is an 'unknown' science fiction writer and Dwayne Hoover is a Midwest Pontiac dealer who uses Trout's book \\"Now It Can Be Told\\" as his inspiration for being a \\"homicidal maniac.\\" Despite the winding storyline, Vonnegut's personal philosophy creeps in about racism, sexism, jingoism and everything else wrong in American society. You have to read this book carefully and thoroughly or else it will fly over your head. It's an awesome book, perhaps one of his best novels."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut, in the Preface to this book, says \\"This book is my fiftieth birthday present to myself.\\" The result is a novel which is a little lighter, a little less focused, and a little more witty than his other novels. One of the main characters of this novel is Kilgore Trout, a struggling (in fact, failed) writer who can only get his stories and novels published as filler for pornographic magazines and books. Anyone who has read Slaughterhouse Five by Vonnegut will recognize Trout's name--the main character of that novel, Billy Pilgrim, spends some time in a hospital next to a man (Eliot Rosewater) who is Trout's ONLY fan, and who has a private collection of Trout's work which is larger than the one Trout himself has.Trout makes his appearance in this book when he departs for an arts festival in a small town called Midland City. There his path crosses with Dwayne Hoover, a car dealer who is already a little off his rocker and is soon to be made completely insane by Trout's writings, which he takes seriously. Though this was not my favorite of Vonnegut's novels, and though I did not enjoy the story as much as some of his other works, I could not help enjoying this book. Vonnegut is a superb writer, a true master of his craft. The drawings he includes are funny and add to the overall satirical effect of the book. Vonnegut perhaps included that part about the book being a birthday present so it wouldn't be taken as seriously as some of his other novels. I think the best part of this book is that it seems like Vonnegut wrote it just for the sake of writing, and that he didn't care what anyone would think of it. Breakfast of Champions certainly is not the masterpiece that Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle are, but it is nevertheless a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"As successful suburbanite Dwayne Hoover steadily goes out of his mind (from natural causes) he comes to believe that he is the only self-aware being in the universe and that everyone else is a robot created to test him. He believes this because obscure sci-fi writer Kilgore Trout told him so-or so he believes-in a short story. Of course Trout was not speaking to Hoover exactly and nobody is really a robot out to test Dwayne. None the less, without knowing it, Hoover is about to meet what he believes is his creator, Kilgore Trout, while Vonnegut himself watches from a corner table behind dark sunglasses in a tacky motel bar. And Trout will subsequently meet Vonnegut, his own creator, in an alley late at night.Breakfast of Champions was Vonnegut's 50th birthday present to himself, and if Cat's Cradle is at the edge of control Breakfast of Champions gleefully abandons all pretense to take a wild ride through postwar Americana with the bruised and cynical Trout unknowingly cruising headlong into the unstable Hoover at an arts festival. Along the way Vonnegut skewers absolutely everything in a rant replete with his own drawings and doodles.There is a simple plot here but it's mostly a vehicle for Vonnegut. After all, there's a good reason his alter-ego Trout is the star of the show. Subtlety and shading are not strengths of this novel. A relentless and brutally observant wit are, and they play unrestrained in a sandbox as big as America and as demented as Dwayne's hallucinations. Normally, Vonnegut is as unapologetically humane as a writer gets but leavens it with sly, observant humor. This time he's all angry cynic with no leavening.This isn't humor for everyone, but for a look at yourself blackened with caustic wit it doesn't get any better or funnier. It's first rate stuff if you've got a taste for darker humor and something so unconventional that the author himself appears to the characters and not only interacts with them but messes with their heads. Maybe this should be seen with the monologues of humorists rather than as straight fiction. Either way it is an important work from one of our best authors and is very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In the novel, Breakfast of Champions, by Kurt Vonnegut, the author uses rising action to effectively tell the story of a brief, yet meaningful meeting between Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover. Dwayne Hoover, increasingly affected by \`bad chemicals', builds up to an explosion of madness. Knowing from the beginning that Dwayne is doomed to insanity amplifies the tension and holds the reader in suspense, waiting for the inevitable to happen. While the book uses rising action, it isn't in the sense of an action movie, but instead uses descriptions of a series of upcoming events that lead to the fateful meeting of Hoover and Trout. The book is strengthened by the way Vonnegut builds up to the climax.To Vonnegut, \`what' is less important than \`why'. In first two-thirds of the book, he uses the rising action technique to relate why the events happen. He not only describes why they happen, but he expresses his opinions on the reasons why. In doing this, he slips in a mocking comment or two in order to keep the reader engaged. The book is enjoyable because he spends the first half discussing what's to come and why it's going to happen, all with a sardonic twist. He conveys many cynical views, and relates them to the characters. He even puts himself in the story, showing the power of the author as the creator of the universe within the novel. The way he describes the actions before they happen, and clarifies why they happen, makes the novel much more interesting.However, some readers may see a downside to Vonnegut's work. While he does utilize an interesting way to tell the story, and to express his sarcastic observations, the lack of action may be viewed as somewhat boring. Readers interested in more dynamic suspense filled books may have trouble holding out until the end. He could appear to go on and on about the same topics, offering different view points on them, and it dragging out the novel. For readers accustomed to action adventures, the rising action may not seem to rise much, if at all.Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions is overall an excellent book. Because of his use of rising action to convey his interesting perspectives on life, he is able to draw readers into to wanting to find out what happens to the characters. His sharp wit and mocking attitude can bring many laughs, accompanied by harsh truths. Breakfast of Champions easily warrants four and one-half stars, for it's excellence as a novel, as well as the satirical truths that are shown about the world."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I love this book. It's simple to read and it truly makes you think about the world differently. I have given away a lot of copies to friends."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I loved this story. I won't go into much detail, because there are so many other reviews.The only reason I gave it four stars (instead of five) was because of the low quality of the Kindle eBook.The proofreading was HORRIBLE. Words were missing; punctuation was missing; words wereruntogether (get it?); some word swere split and joined to the next word (get it?).I really love reading the eBooks on the Kindle, but this is a good example of a book where the quality control was severely lacking."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast Of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut *****Breakfast Of Champions is satire at it's all time best, and Breakfast of Champions is Kurt Vonnegut's all time best, the only other novel of his to even come close is Slaughterhouse-Five. Which is a must read. But as I was saying, BoC is a not so subtle comment on the social structure of America in the early 1970's, but what is so amazing, much like with Orwel's Nineteen Eighty Four, and Huxleys Brave New World, is that this is more relevant now then it was thirty-forty years ago. His take on war, racism, and politics strips them of their importance and breaks them to their core and makes you realize how much energy and time we spend on these things. He does the same with Sex, and success, and material goods as well.As for the story itself, it is a strange one, and one that is at sometimes hard to follow, or it would be at least if it weren't for the excellent drawings depicting what is currently happening in the story. Yes this has pictures but it is in no way a graphic novel in the technical since. As Killgore Trout a novelist makes his way to a arts rally across the country he finds himself face to face with a man named Dwayne who believes his storys are true and has become a psychopath because of it. It only gets weirder from there.The book is not tired or a strain to read ever, it is one of the most enjoyable reads I have ever had, and I would go so far as to say that Breakfast Of Champions is one of my top five books of all time."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is Vonnegut's famous \\"50th birthday present to himself\\", and if you ask me, he spoiled himself with it. Out of the few Vonnegut books I've read, this is the funniest, and probably the best. Basically, Kurt here dismisses the entire American nation as racist, materialist, and obsessed with sex, class, alcohol, conformity, and whatever else you could trot out. It would be considered a pessimistic, nihilistic viewpoint if it wasn't a sadly accurate look at the way America worked, and still works today. And for a little note to those who think the book is racist, keep in mind that the black characters are actually portrayed as being, in a way, a lot more intelligent and less misanthropic than the white ones.This isn't an easy book to describe. There's a plot, but Kurt veers away from it on several occasions, offering a wide variety of satiric tangents that make for some of the most hilarious parts of his writing. There are illustrations, crude, simple, and absolutely hilarious. Kurt even sticks himself in the book, makes himself a character, and has discussions with other characters. Choice segments include the scene at the Holiday Inn cocktail lounge, where Kurt has a discussion with himself; every discussion of Kilgore Trout's misadventures with getting his books published by his sleazy publishing house; the uproarious prologue; every illustration; every tangent; and... well, pretty much everything. It's not a book for everyone, but if you're looking for a whole ton of laughs in one place, and some of the best satire known to mankind... whoa. This is it.Oh yeah, the book's about what happens when car dealer Wayne Hoover decides everyone on Earth but him is a robot. But, as I said before, the plot is secondary here."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is my first experience with Mr. Vonnegut, whom many of my friends think is one of the best writers ever. I chose Breakfast of Champions because I liked the title - I liked it even more when I learned that it was in reference to martinis. Vonnegut has a unique sense of humor and a style of writing that seems as candid as if he were writing it as a stream of consciousness or sitting in the same room with you telling the story. And it works, it works wondefully and I can't wait to read more of his works. Breakfast of Champions is about two men (a car salesman and a pulp fiction writer) who eventually cross paths in a cocktail lounge. The side characters aren't trivial - they each contribute in some way to each other and to the main characters. Vonnugut illustrates the book with simple and comical drawings that he did himself. While at times I wondered where in the story I was and what he was telling me about at the moment might (or might not) lead to, I stuck with it simply to keep enjoying his style and writing. The book seemed to be laughing at the planet and the people on it, breaking humans down into robots who are programmed to do this and that. Humans, in this novel, did not seem to enjoy the life they were living or take much pride in the world they lived in. The narrator (Vonnegut himself) often compares his characters penis size or the women's body measurements - otherwise nothing personal or individualistic about them. I looked up reviews and notes of the book after I finished reading hoping that they might offer something that I missed or a subplot that I didn't pick up on. I didn't find much, which told me that the book just has to be read to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I had to read this book for a college English course, and I finished it within days of the initial assignment. It's a really fabulous novel.It's clear that some reviewers missed the point of this novel. Yes, most definitely an easy and entertaining read, there are many, many layers. It also has a great meta-narrative. What some consider \\"condescending\\" is really a play on the plot itself. It's written in the guise of a sci-fi novel Kilgore might write. Basically, it's written so that someone (either a child or someone not from Earth) can understand the things that we seemingly take for granted.Vonnegut also alludes to the idea that we've lost touch with our past and what was once important to us through different annecdotes and stories. He has a really great argument about naming and how the importance of such names are either lost or ignored. It's a great commentary on our lives as Americans especially.I absolutely recommend this book. It's a great, fast read."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"kurt vonnegut, jr. is a brilliant man. having said that now, this book is a work of genius. it is perhaps the funniest thing i have ever read in my life. but more than that, it is a horrible insult to me. that only works to make the book more effective as a piece of entertainment, as well as a work of philosophy. read this book because that is what you were created to do."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut packs an unforgettable punch in The Breakfast of Champions. It's a punch that will knock you on your side and make you laugh, but also one that will knock you on your head and make you think. Vonnegut begs us to have awareness - &quot;the unwavering band of light&quot; that separates us from conformist &quot;fully programmed robots&quot; that comprise the mundane world around us. Through his wacky, fun, &amp; always zany ride through Midland City, Vonnegut dares us to open our minds to an undiscovered world that few of us seldom visit. As Vonnegut's alter ego, The Creator of the Universe, so aptly states, &quot;Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done.&quot;Bravo!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I can't see myself giving this book anything but five stars. Most novels read more than once, in my opinion, have to be considered good enough for that, though I know that there are exceptions. I first read Breakfast of Champions back in about 1975 or so, and it blew me away. It became the first of many Vonnegut novels I eventually dug into, and the second to be read again (Cat's Cradle as well), but definitely my favorite. His avant-garde sense of humor and easy writing style, especially in this one, was as much a pleasure the second time as the first.The story of Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout, and their crazed antics and lifestyles leading up to their pinnacle meeting point is as hilarious as it can get. It's full of satire and cynicism regarding life in general (especially that of the late sixties and early seventies). The way Vonnegut picks at sex (you'll notice the way he mentions the size of a man's genitalia when introducing a character into the story, just as an author would describe hair or eyes), and racism (for the 'N' word is ridiculed and teased), is sheer lunacy at its most hilarious level.If you're ever in the mood to read something that isn't exactly intended to change the world or move mountains with intellectualism, but at the same time, does have the power to force us to think a little about life, and make us laugh horrendously as well, then this is it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is the story of two skinny old white guys &quot;on a planet that was dying fast.&quot; We watch Dwayne Hoover, the insane used-car dealer, and Kilgore Trout, the brilliant but almost completely unknown writer and installer of vinyl siding, drawing nearer and nearer to each other as the story progresses.

His pictures do nothing but add to the entertainment of the words. I love to read books that seem to be conpletely insane and pointless but are thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking. Everyone with any intelligence should read this book and laugh about it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Poo-tee-tweet? Let me ask you one question. What would you ask your creator, if given the chance? Vonnegut gives us his best writing and insight, in this incredible Novel. The characters are brilliant, the setting is clear, and I now believe, that humans, are indeed robots. Machines.oh, to be young again."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; was Vonnegut's true follow-up to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; and brought a big sigh of relief to those confused by &quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot; and &quot;Between Time and Timbuktoo.&quot; It is Kilgore Trout's show here, and fans will find Vonnegut's principal character in rare form as he journeys to a celebration in his honor, spurred on by his one reader, the famous Eliot Rosewater. There is also another story about a used car salesman losing his mind and wreaking havoc on the good times.Of course, the novel is probably most famous for a character that comes in late in the novel, one Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Here, Vonnegut does his best Pirendello and confronts his world head on. An interesting and often hysterical time; its just too bad that much of the early part of the book is tedious. If you can hold on until the book gets rolling, you'll have the ride of your life."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is a great read. It addresses you as a three-year old and explains even the simplest concepts in new and hilarious ways. It is vulgar and attention-grabbing. His simple drawings can draw a hearty laugh, even from the dullest of people. Well, maybe I shouldn't go that far, but they are quite entertaining.This book is good for when your mind has an overload on intelligent thought."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"One of the book that makes me drop out. Okay, it's a familiar story, you've heard it all before but if there's such a thing as an influential book, Breakfast of Champions is one of them. The drawings in themselves are classic, do you still remember the &quot;beaver&quot;?. I haven't read this in a long time, I'm ordering the book....."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"vonnegut takes you on a trip through the lives of two helpless soul that he creates. it is never dull or even dump. this book had me spellbound for the hour it took me to read it. a bonus note: this book is even more enjoyable after reading &quot;God Bless you Mr.Rosewater&quot; and &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; They sort of act as an unoffical trilogy. The ending is amazing. it stills has me thinking about it."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"A definite tear-jerker, both in laughter and sorrow, Breakfast of Champions is a novel about everything. Kurt brings 2 people together, Kilgore Trout, the chronically indiferent and highly unmotivated alter-ego of Vonnegut, and the car dealer in the Mid-West with &quot;bad chemicals.&quot; This book is supposed to be a movie, Dwayne Hoover being played by Bruce Willis. That's a good casting. This is a must for Vonnegut fans and those who want to understand life, the universe and everything the way it actually it is. The best example of the classic description of Vonnegut's style - gallow's humor"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is Vonnegut's best. If you've never read his stuff, PLEASE read this. Makes you think (about everything), laugh out loud, and at the same time, breaks your heart."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book got me hooked on Kurt who is a member of my fraternity, Delta Upsilon. Beware, you will now be sucked into his uncanny world of coincedence and relation to experience a book that will cause your legs to fall asleep if you read it on the toilet. Kurt's publishers should just market &quot;The Kurt Vonnegut Collection&quot; because you'll end up buying all his books anyway."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I know it's tedious to hear it again, but this really is the best book I have ever read, and it's my job to read books. Vonnegut reassesses everythng he's done so far (so you don't have to read it) (good job, on some of his titles, to be truthful). Bascically, if you've ever wanted your very own Anthropologist to scrutinise your strange 20th century ways, here it is. Don't be fooled by the 'talking to a two year old' tone Vonnegut adopts, this one could change your reading for a long long time! Don't waste time reading a review - read it!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Speaking as one who has just finished reading _Timequake_ (his latest) and thus can be accurately qualified as one who has read all of Vonnegut's &quot;major&quot; works, I can say with authority that _Breakfast of Champions_ is is best. Simple on the outside, yet with far-reaching questions of where we are headed, the book is chillingly accurate in modern-day, &quot;progressive&quot; 1997, even though it was written sometime in the early 70s. This book should be read by anyone who has ever wondered about technology, New York city, or the finer works of this gifted novelist. Definitely a 10. [And lest I forget -- the book comes with pictures, interspersed liberally through the pages; rough-looking and hand-drawn though they may be, they contribute a fanciful air to the already-impressive work. They, too, are definitely a plus.]"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is Vonnegut at his best. He is a master satirist who knows how to control his characters to do his will. This is Vonnegut's masterpiece featuring one of literatures most dumped on characters since Job, Kilgore Trout. You have to read this one. If you haven't, then what is your problem?"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This novel, Goodbye Blue Monday, is among the finest literay pieces, I have ever read. Anything, and everything, which is great about Vonnegut, is in this book. Great characters, satire, sex, and sci-fi. After reading this, I feel the same as Dwayne Hoover, that everyone IS a robot, and they must be taken down. Poo-tee-weet? Make me young! Make me young! Tell me one thing, what would you ask your creator, if given the chance"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"While simplistic in mechanics andvocabulary, this book never fails to shedlight on every idea anyone ever thought.In short, BRILLIANT. A handbookto life, you wouldn't have to go to school,if you read this book the day you weresupposed to be starting kindergarten.You're life would be as dysfunctional as allof Vonnegut's characters' are, but hey...Where's the downside???!!!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This was suppose to be his last, thus paving the path for the most outrageous book he has written. Funniest and most unique book I have read to this point in my life."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"In 1973, at 16 years of age, this is the first book I read on my own,(not assigned school reading). Thank you Mr. Vonnegut for helping lift the veil of hypocrisy from my eyes so light may be let in."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I don't really know if many of the people who give this book a luke-warm review even know what they are talking about. Take it at face value without putting too much forethought into the fact that Kurt Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse-five and you will realize that it is a great, thought provoking, hilarious novel. I would recommend anyone to give it a try."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Not Vonnegut's best, but not his worst. Not that it really matters, because his worst is still worth buying and reading. A little too fantastic and meandering for my taste, but the satire never misses."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"What makes Vonnegut a true and marvelous master of the human condition and life and everything is his acceptance of the unexplainable. Rather than trying to give reasons and solutions, he simply lays it all out in a vastly entertaining style, and challenges his readers to make something of the mess. Here, with a unspectacular cast of characters whirling around in a lot of nothing, it's really rather amazing how deeply touching and brilliant the story is. Although this has a lot to do with Vonnegut's uncanny ability to poke your mind with subtle points in an obvious fashion, it also has to do with the fact that not everything is glamorous and suspenseful and neat. In fact, very little is. The meeting of Vonnegut and Trout at the end is absolutely classic, I could not stop grinning through the entire encounter, and the book itself is genius. Dare to be cynical with the master."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book was very insightful and entertaining. Some other readers think that this is trash and belongs in the garbage can but it's not. If you wish to read something thought-provoking yet humorous choose this book!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"If you are looking for an entertaining, yet wonderfully written satire, Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions' is obviously the best choice. The entire book is hilarious, the self-illustrations by Vonnegut create a strong foundation of both his vivid imagination and sheer genius. I highly recommend this book, being it is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"THIS WAS THE FIRST VONNEGUT BOOK I READ AND IT REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. HOWEVER YOU COULD CHOOSE ANY BOOK BY VONNEGUT AND HAVE SELECTED A CLASSIC. :-)"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I have to admit that I am not fond of ironies and sarcasm. However, Vonnegut delivered a unique perspective of his believes in this comical novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions.&quot; The ending was quite a surprise, but I don't believe it could have been any better. I certainly appreciate being exposed to Vonnegut's work. He's a great American writer and deserves the recognition he has earned."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I hadn't read Vonnegut for several years until I picked BOC up recently. It didn't take long to remind me why I used to read him so often years ago: His books personify the type of books I love to read. They are constantly entertaining, while at the same time philosophical and thought-provoking. One of Vonneguts many talents is the ability to write in language that is simple enough to be accessible to the masses, but never &quot;dumbed-down&quot;. Vonnegut's anthropoligical approach to this book, that of a detached observer, make for fascinating and powerful examinations of the way humans live and think and behave. This novel was extremely funny, yet always with an undercurrent of immense sadness at how our world has turned out."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I usually take forever to finish books (I'll start another one in the middle of one or just lose interest) but I read this one straight through cover to cover. Vonnegut is a brilliant satirist and this book had me laughing throughout. This book inspired me to buy Slaughterhouse Five which I hope to get around to reading soon."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"\\"Celia had committed suicide, for instance, - by eating Drano - a mixture of sodium hydroxide, Celia became a small volcano.\\" The essence of Vonnegut's style is in that line. He's blunt yet rather casual. If you can get past this voice devoid of classical description you will thoroughly enjoy his themes and storytelling....well...as long as you can get past his story telling style. There's really no structure (at least for what most teachers consider to be structure) and the lines are scattered. But once delved into his stories, just like his style, are very original. Breakfast of Champions centers around Vonnegut, the narrator, going insane at 50, a car salesman, Dwayne Hoover also going crazy and Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's brainchild, at the whim of the delirious men who's chemicals are self destructing. The themes are pretty typical for Vonnegut ..... technology = bad, dehumanization and ..... and his newest of looking back on society with a babies eye and realizing how ludicrous everything is. As in \\"Sometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too. Sometimes people would get on airplanes that were supposed to fly to someplace, and they would offer to put holes in the pilot and co-pilot unless they flew the airplane, to someplace else.\\" No matter how \\"modern\\" But, if one thing truly stands out in Vonnegut (which I'm sure has been said a million times before) is that he's a satirical genius. Who isn't up for a bit of flag-bashing anyways? (Flag in the sense of everything that we stand for and squander)"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut obviously has a scewed idea of what America is. He envisions all humans as robots, being controlled by the Creator of the Universe, who is incidentally himself. The story centers mainly around two characters: Dwayne Hoover, a fabulously well-to-do Pontiac dealer, and Kilgore Trout, and unknown science-fiction writer who also sells aluminum siding. Dwayne Hoover lived a normal life up until the time of his wife's suicide. Over the next couple of years, Dwayne became unhinged from who he used to be and by the time he met Kilgore Trout in the cocktail bar of a Holiday Inn, Dwayne went seriously crazy. Kilgore Trout went from thinking he might not even be alive on the planet, to being invited to speak as the guest of honor at an arts festival.Throughout the story, Kurt used simple sentences and language that made it a very easy and enjoyable read. Breakfast of Champions was a parody on what the world is turning into, a planet that is wasting away. Vonnegut shows the ignorance and chaos of human life through racism, stupidity, and insanity, while throwing silly pictures and subtle humor at the reader throughout the book.I suggest this book to anyone who enjoys books that can make you think twice about a simple subject, such as mirrors or underpants. Its one that you'll want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Using his unique style, Vonnegut tells the galaxy about our dying planet. He sees it as a hideous mess of robotic creatures programmed to destroy themselves, specifically through destruction by American capitalism and racism. At times this does seem a bit cliche, but his style is anything but. It's funny, original, and at times very personal.The best parts of the book are when he literally draws himself into the story. He tries to be a good God to his characters, but seems to fail as our Creator must have. It's not as good as Slaughter House Five, but his shocking style is in strong form.For those who want to pick up the audio version for the Vonnegut interview- don't. In the beginning of the interview Vonnegut and his interviewer both reveal that they havent read the book in a while, then proceed to talk about completely unrelated topics which go nowhere. Tucci does a fine job of reading though."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is by far one of the most artistic books Vonnegut has ever written. Both a very poignant critique of American society and a auto-biography. In fact, it's a book that not only lambasts American lifestyles it's also a critique of Humanity as a whole. It's a satire about human folly and futility. It's About flesh machinery and complacency. It's About superfluous endeavors and non-sense. I never though I would laugh at misery and calamity before in my life , yet as one reads this primer laughing at such things is all but inevitable.On the literary aspect of this book, it possesses the master penmanship one would expect from Vonnegut. It's post-modern meta-fiction at its best. I HIGHLY recommend this title to anyone who's willing to reflect upon his life and who's willing to reflect upon societal values and moral values and human value. Definitely one of Vonnegut's best."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Although this novel was at times childish, shocking, humorous, and perhaps even a bit disturbing, I think Vonnegut effectively conveyed his feelings concerning the more peculiar social fixations and oddities that are prevalent in our time. However, what moved me most out of all of Vonnegut's blatant strikes were his remarks concerning the value of characters in literature. Of course, almost anybody reading this book can pick out a few characters who they consider to be &quot;main&quot; or key characters consistently throughout the novel, but Vonnegut raises the question of the equality of characters in a novel. While Vonnegut was not completely successful in blurring the status of the main characters in his novel, I felt like his attempt at creating his supporting characters as equals was well done and I commend him for it. I'm sure Vonnegut realizes that a story in which all characters are equal in detail/depth/development would destroy the staggered levels of complexity that make literature so fascinating, but raising the question in really caused me to stop and think. Vonnegut's illustrations prove why he's a writer rather than an artist, but I guess I appreciate how the drawings made the pages go by more quickly."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Kurt Vonnegut was politically incorrect long before it became the chic thing to do. This is Vonnegut at his finest as he intertwines the destiny of so many characters including himself. Breakfast of Champions was the first book I ever read by Vonnegut so I had to go back and read it again recently, and I can say with great certainty that there aren't too many books that can have you laughing at the mistakes of human belief and behavior."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"i spent the whole book laughing outloud. it was fabulous. i wish every book were like this one."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I have used this book on several occasions to introduce friends and family to Vonnegut. In this fast and easy read, you have all of Vonnegut's strengths, all the elements of his masterpieces (Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle, etc.) in one amazing novel. It is hilarious and ridiculous at times (he illustrates the novel himself with hand-drawn pictures of underpants and wide-open beavers), but always there is the genuine love for human beings and the deep feelings of hope and loss which Vonnegut and his fellow WW2 soldier/writer Joseph Heller are famous for.Read this book as an introduction to his other works. If you've already read some of Vonnegut's works, you can find all the threads of his philosophy come together here. Make it the beginning and the end to a Vonnegut study-- die-hard fans, read it again! You will discover something new to enjoy every time you read it.Ah, and this is one of those situations where the film adaptation should NOT be substituted for the real thing, nor should you judge the book by the horrid movie of the same name."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Breakfast of Champions is Kurt Vonnegut at his finest. Instead of his usual attempt to focus around a central theme, Vonnegut attacks everything American in BofC. Critics argue that the novel lacks the depth of his other books. On the contrary, he is quite thorough, albeit he forces the reader to think a bit on his or her own without anything being spelled out. This leaves the reader pondering Vonnegut's insightful remarks for weeks afterwards. When someone recommends classic Vonnegut, they usually say Slaughterhouse 5. I think they should reconsider and move this novel to the top of their list."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"A testament to its greatness is that ... well ... it's indescribable.What's the plot? Um ... well ....Who are the characters? Well ... yeah, it's kinda hard to say. Um... the narrator is both a character and the author. Nothing really happens, yet so much goes on. Oh, sections will make you laugh out loud because they're so stupid, except it somehow reaches the core of humanity. I mean, not only physically, but on a metaphysical sense. Even an alternative universe sort of way.Okay, now I'm babbling. But trust me, it's all that and so much more."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This hilarious and frightening book can still inspire writers to take chances and write satire that hits deep. I cannot say if it always works because it is both very accessible and far out science fiction. But Vonnegut is courageous and right on."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Can you get tired of reading a novel that you know is going to feature Kilgore Trout at some point?I don'tKurt Vonnegut has a very sharp mind and seeps through the e-ink screenHours of fun"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut was a mad and sad genies. This is my favorite of his books as it embodies so well the themes that seem to run through all his writing. I would describe it as a melancholy optimism. Some one once described his work with the statement &#34;When love fails, curtsey will suffice&#34; and I think that nails it on the head. Others have told me the find his work depressing but I find myself so energized by it. Would highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Just a great book by a great author. Definitely a must read if you are trying to get into Vonnegut's works"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"SIMPLY AMAZING, DEEP, AND LAUGH -OUT- LOUD FUNNY! He breaks all of the rules of a typical novelist, while maintaining structure and simultaneous candor!"},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This was my very first book written by Vonnegut and I am glad and happy to say it will not be the last. I just adored this book. I adored the writing, the ease with which Vonnegut expresses disillusion and dissolution. He was a master of sarcasm and left me laughing out loud at the sketches and commentary.To leave me wondering from one page to the next, refusing to put the book down was a thrill. I wanted to know what would happen to this Trout and his eccentricities, wondering what would happen to Dwayne Hoover and his son who is mentioned in passing. Hoover's world becomes what we sometimes believe in ourselves at one point or another and makes us ask: what is wrong with everyone?A wonderful romp into the mind of a progressive author who wrote to make a point but insisted on having fun while doing it so well and so eloquently.I just love it! He will be missed."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Vonnegut was tired and crankier than ever by the time he wrote &#34;Breakfast of Champions&#34; but so are we. We are reminded when reading &#34;Breakfast&#34; that some perceptive souls like Vonnegut understood and decried long ago the America of economic and environtmental degradation. He was ahead of the curve. As I reread him I recognize not only the world Iived in but the world I still live in, none the better for the intervening years. His outrageous characters, including the author who appears in the story, make us laugh and wince. This is the thinking man's uncomfotable laugh at the world we have made."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book is not a sequel to Slaughter House five. It is it's own book. It is a well written book with crude pictures, and crude characters (one character who happens to be in S.H.5.). This book does what a good book is supposed to do."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I feel like Vonnegut's writing style is very polarizing. People either love or hate it. It might be offensive to some, while others find it hilarious. I think it happens to be brilliant satire with nothing held back. I'm not one to balk at profanity or think \\"OMG! He actually drew that in a book?\\", but if you are, don't read it. It's brilliant, straight-from-the-head-to-the-paper type of writing that's funny while pointedly satirical.It's a quick and enjoyable read. If you're looking for something a little different to read, pick this up! If you like it, be sure to check out Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, and Bluebeard as well."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"After reading Galapagos and Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions poorly portray's the brilliance of Kurt Vonnegut. The story drags and seems inadequate.It does pick up at the end though, where it somewhat redeems itself. Vonnegut's typical skewed view of the world narrates you through the story of two strangers who have alot more to do with each other than they know of. Vonnegut shares with the readers his view on life."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"this book is not only easy to read but also a lot of fun. the characters are about a wimsical as you cna get. i look forward to reading all of vonnegut's books. this book is incredibly irreverant as well as it deals with psychological illness in a less than traditional fashion."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"It has been awhile since I've read this book so I don't recall many of the details of the book, but I suddenly found the urge to write a short review for it. In short, this book changed my life. It made me see things from a more intelligent perspective. I recommend this book to every person who is coming of age. This book will change the way you think."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"As to why Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. would think we, the gentle readers, would be interested in the measurements of his penis and the fictional penises of his fictional characters is the greatest mystery of this title, perhaps of the malevolent universe. And so on. Billed as a novel, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is more a collection of socio-economic rantings than an actual work of fiction. Not that I blame Kurt... His tidy little, astute essays in \\"In These Times\\" are quickly forgotten by the public. But, his ideas in his novels will be around for several more years. Don't get me wrong. Ideas don't really make a difference. Really mean people with killing machines make a difference. But, what would I know, being merely a meat robot devoid of free will put here for the amusement of my creator. I give the book one star for literary style, five stars for ideas, and an overall average three stars because it is printed in English in nice type. And so it goes."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I think I've read most everything Vonnegut published. Some 3 or 4 times. This was my second reading of B of C because the first time caused me to exit the doors of Vonnegut's theatre with a headache and a very bad taste in my mouth. It was only later that I recovered.Every writer has highs and lows. This is Vonnegut's nadir. As he stated \\"This book is my fiftieth-birthday present to myself. I feel as though I am crossing the spine of a roof--having ascended one slope.I am programmed at fifty to perform childishly--to insult \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" etc., etc., etc.Basically, cosmic trash and, unfortunately, an enduringly popular part of his legacy.Vonnegut has always had the ability to bring me into his world as a participant. B of C drags the reader almost unwillingly into the mental carnage of piteous self-assessment. But, like the pearls before swine, there are more than a few moments of good writing. My favorite:\\"Listen: The waitress brought me another drink. She wanted to light my hurricane lamp again. I wouldn't let her. \\"Can you see anything in the dark, with your sunglasses on?\\" she asked me.\\"The big show is inside my head,\\" I said.Read it at your peril. You've been sufficiently notified."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This may sound like the kind of frothing review written by somebody who never read the book, but who dislikes the author and gives a bad review on principle; this isn't the case. I liked Vonnegut when I picked up this novel, on account of the much better Cat's Cradle and Mother Night, but after reading Breakfast I began to change my mind.I don't think people should be able to get away with writing books like this.It's self-indulgent. It's heavy-handed, smug, obnoxious and fatuous; even if I agreed with Vonnegut completley, I don't think I would be able to stomach it. His philosophy is presented as a matter of fact, in short, self-satisfied bursts of introspection, while characters from his other novels blunder around pointlessly - but what separates this novel from some existentialist or surrealist masterpiece is the disgusting, homespun sentimentality evident on every single page. It's a grand combination of nonsense and mawkishness, peppered, just for the heck of it apparently, with the tons of 'cute' sexual references and the occasional obscene drawing. Because Vonnegut himself is such an overbearing presence in the novel, I found myself hating him personally when I had finished it. Please, please don't buy this book; bury the abberation, don't let other authors think that this is what the novel has become."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This book was highly recommended by a coworker. As a result, I subsequently really question this person's credibility. This is one of the most pointless, self-indulgent, absolutely unnecessary books I've ever read. Before buying, read the prologue - Vonnegut didn't even want to write this book! Take Vonnegut's own advice and don't bother reading this senseless prose. It was written &#34;to clear (his) head of all the mental junk that had piled up in 50 years of living on planet Earth&#34; at the time of writing. Rated 1 star because I couldn't rate it zero..."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"Save your money. Other books I have read by Kurt Vannegutt had some redeaming qualities; this on has none, in my view."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"I have tried to get through this book. Maybe I am trying to take it too literally. Maybe it's fantastic and I am just obtuse. It has been suggested to me that another Vonnegut would be a better starting point; I am repeating that advise here."},{"Title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This is honestly one of the worst books I have ever read. I was saddened to see how far Vonnegut's mind had apparently deteriorated by the time I read this novel. It's a bunch of disjointed babbling about the most boring things imaginable; if I hadn't read the back of the book I wouldn't even be sure if it was intended to be humor. Practically nothing in it is the least bit funny or entertaining. It looks like it was written by a heavily drugged 10-year-old as a school assignment to explain Earth to an even younger and more ignorant child. Throughout there are infantile explanations of the most basic terms as if Vonnegut intended his book to survive for centuries until it was a historical relic, used by future societies to understand ours. One of the most stunningly idiotic things in the book (or any book I have read) is his technique of babbling about himself in the first person in the middle of telling the story, as if the story wasn't boring enough in itself; it has perhaps two plot events total. He even makes claims about his penis size. It is beyond me how any intelligent person above the age of 12 could find this interesting.I loved Player Piano, Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle, which were nothing like this book, and can only assume from the stark contrast that Vonnegut suffered from senility at a much younger age than usual."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fasting","review":"This book is a fantastic resource for anyone wishing to fast. The information is varied and thorough, and perfect for a beginning faster. With sections on the history of fasting, spirituality, meditation, health and more, this is a must-have book on fasting. While other fasting books provide interesting information on why fasting is beneficial, this book details exactly how to fast and what to expect when you fast. It also includes modified fast information including juice-fasts, etc."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fasting","review":"This book probably spends more time discussing holistic health practices than fasting. There are 5 chapters on &quot;Greater Spritual Awareness.&quot; The author is a &quot;holistic&quot; health writer. While there are many fasting facts in the book, wading through all the new-age and religious jargon to find them is challenging. I am disappointed and am searching for a book with more meat in it and less &quot;spiritualism.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fasting","review":"If you have never fasted before, and want to learn the basics of how and why, this is a decent book. Unfortunately, you have to wade through a lot of superfluous blather.Having studied the subject at length, I found the science behind the book to be fairly sound, although there were a number of questionable claims (and a couple that were outright false).As a Christian, I had some serious problems with the book. The most offensive part was the suggestion that when Jesus was tempted by the Devil after 40 days of fasting in the desert, Jesus was experiencing a fasting-induced hallucination! I started reading the book with the knowledge that there would be a lot of discussion of Eastern religions, meditation, and New Age-ism, so that did not offend me (I still don't buy the whole \\"chakra\\" thing, but I won't argue that point here).

What we take as matter, what we take to be \\"the world\\" are but our perceptions of some unknown reality. This line of thought became known as \\"idea-lism\\" and has been a thread in the history of Western philosophy since then. But this line of thought is very ancient. Plato expressed it in his well-known allegory of the cave, in which the world we perceive is but a shadow of something else, something of which we are generally completely unaware. Such a line of thought is extremely well developed in Eastern thought in such philosophies as Sankhya, Vedanta, and in the practical works of Raja yoga.This general line of thought has fallen out of favor over the past several centuries in the West, due in large part to the rise of science, and the underlying philosophy of materialism, that has since morphed into the philosophy of physicalism, the dominant, if generally implicit paradigm of the modern world.In spite of being eclipsed by the dazzling successes of the physical sciences in the West, it is a completely undeniable fact that our conscious awareness forever serves as an intermediary to what ever it is that is being represented as \\"the world\\" in our awareness. However, particularly in modern times, this general fact of our experience is neglected in our considerations of the world.In Conquest of Illusion, van der Leeuw begins from this premise. But he does not construct philosophical arguments. No. This book is about his first-hand experiences from his advanced practice of yoga, exploring both the nature of consciousness and the nature of this thing we call \\"the world\\" that appears in our consciousness. van der Leeuw describes the >>result&lt;&lt; of successfully achieving the main goal of yoga, which is direct awareness of the eternal that underlies this \\"thing\\" we call existence.The book is profound in every conceivable respect. In spite of the exponential growth of our current understanding of the material world, including the brain and the cosmos, this book is still apropos. It describes the eternal veritas underlying time, space, the mind, and our relative existence.Perhaps the single most important quote of this book is:\\"The mystery of life in not a problem to be solved, it is a reality to be experienced.\\"It is clear to one informed in such matters that van der Leeuw is describing in a lucid and (relatively) easy to understand fashion what has been described for centuries in Eastern, and specifically Indian philosophy, and in particular in the Kashmiri Shavism school of Indian thought.The relevance of this book will only continue to grow over time as thinkers again begin to recognize in ever greater measure the implications that the \\"world\\" that exists, and this \\"world\\" as it appears in our conscious awareness are by no means identical.If you want to get ahead of the curve, I suggest reading this book - many times."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Illusion","review":"if completely understood and assimilated, this book will seriously alter your perception of life."},{"Title":"Greek Folk Dancing","review":"It is the first thing I have bought from Amazon, which upset me.

It is suited for the traveler who intends to visit the countries that feature these 12 languages, but not for the student who is trying to learn one particular language. Alternatively, the book will serve well the student of a language who needs a quick reference for simple phrases, should he stumble.The book features simple greetings and situational phrases, such as at the airport or the restaurant, along with a brief history of each language. It also has a section devoted to telling time, which I found lacking, since it did not cover all the times of the day (just the times within 9 o'clock, and how to say \\"noon,\\" \\"afternoon,\\" and \\"evening,\\" for example).

Because they lacked funds for proper recreation, Addams argues, poor and socially marginalized women were susceptible to sexual slavery, and without radical social change they would perhaps be \\"almost as free\\" as young men.In addition to promoting higher wages and better living conditions, Addams suggests that a longer period of public education for young women would deter them from the dangers of city life. Despite its appeal to middle-class readers eager for tales of sexual excess and the rape of innocence, the press and prominent intellectuals criticized A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil for being disproportionately hysterical to its philosophical weight."},{"Title":"A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil","review":"a new conscience and an ancient evi"},{"Title":"Revolutionary Romanticism: A Drunken Boat Anthology","review":"Blechman's book is an excellent introduction to the Romantic origins of radical thought. It will prove an essential anthology for all readers with an interest in anarchism, libertarian Marxism, and the avant-garde."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Romanticism: A Drunken Boat Anthology","review":"First off, I shall demur by averring that this is an interesting collection of essays and that Blechman is a sensitive and passionate writer in his own right. He clearly believes or \\"has faith\\" that all that is presented here coheres to form a basis for revolutionizing the current state of affairs.That being conceded, this drunken boat simply doesn't float (apologies to Rimbaud). To go so far as to enlist Blake, who was arguably neither Revolutionary nor Romantic save in some oblique chiliastic sense, and is quoted in this very book as stating that, \\"I am really sorry to see my Countrymen trouble themselves about Politics.\\" in a formula for Twenty-First Century revolution is illustrative of how much of this entire argument is rather out on a limb.The best essay by far is Abensour's essay on William Morris and his News from Nowhere (1890). Here, the ambiguity inherent in all revolutionary Utopian visions when put into practice is presented with great lucidity. I would recommend this book for just this one essay.Sadly, though, the rest of the book seems terribly dated in our \\"post-ideological\\" era. It recurrently turns to sources from the past in hopes of providing a springboard for revolutionary conceptualizations which will alter our world once put into practice. Given today's state of affairs, such an endeavour will probably only seem worthwhile to, perhaps, soi-disant French intellectuals and cranks in general.As Christopher Winks points out in his essay on Erich Muhsam, \\"And once intellectuals renounce their potentially greatest asset - their independence - they become incapable of really questioning anything. Their submission is bought with grants, publisher's advances, lecture tours, and lucrative positions; under these conditions, whatever spark of creativity they may possess is sooner or later snuffed out.\\"-Can anything ring more resoundingly true of our \\"intelligentsia\\" today and in the foreseeable future?I wish I could be more positive about this book. But I simply can't while my eyes are open.---Of course, given the cyclical nature of history, there may come a time when books such as this can \\"make a difference\\" as it were.

If on the other hand you have been a faithful reader (such as myself) then you MUST add this one to your collection. The three author's have all managed to pen winners and that is something since these are short stories and not full length novels. You won't feel cheated at all.In Ms. Foster's story 'Good With His Hands' we have two neighbors that are friends but each has been thinking a bit too much about the other. Then one day everything changes! Cassidy decides that she will try to make herself a bit more attractive (think tomboy here) and Pete (You've met him in the past. Brother to Gil, and Sam) is willing to change become a little more refined. Well, duh...each likes the other just the way they are. After one day of amazing...relations these two realize that they can still be friend and lovers too. What a concept.In Ms. McCarthy's 'Miss Extreme Congeniality' we hook up again with Wyatt Maddock (Smart Mouth) and CJ White (Also Smart Mouth). This is their story. CJ has an autistic child and she is very weary about men in general. Especially after Sam's dad takes a hike because he can't stand the pressure of a special needs child. Unfortunatly Wyatt is everything CJ knows she should avoid but she makes a deal with him. One night with Wyatt with him calling the shots and he will request a transfer out of the Chicago FBI Office. Well, one night only proves to Wyatt he's not going anywhere...he wants it all with CJ! Can he show this injured woman that he is willing to stay around for the long haul?In Ms. Leigh's 'Last Call' Tess Braeden falls in lust at first sight with hunky Fletcher. She thinks he's the town mechanic and he can help her with getting an audience with the mayor who seems reluctant to give her even one second of his time. Well, she's had more then a second with the mayor, she's kissed him.Fletcher knows exactly who Tess is and he's now in a rock and a hard spot. He wants to help but first he has to fess up to what his day job really is. Hello mayor Fletcher!These were great stories, very steamy (like you're used to with any Lori Foster or Erin McCarthy reads) Morgan Leigh is also a great author and one I look forward to reading again, and a great addition to the 'Bad Boys' line. Pick this up for your summer reading list. A great beach book, or airport book, or traveling in the car book...you get the picture.Official reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"I loved this anthology, Lori Foster, Erin McCarthy and Morgan Leigh wrote fun, sexy novellas that are the perfect thing to read by the pool.In GOOD WITH HIS HANDS by Lori Foster, Pete gets back what he has dished out to his brothers. He is good friends with his next door neighbor Cassidy McClannahan, but things get steamy quick, when he finally realizes the woman he has been looking for is right next door. Ms Foster is the author that started me on reading anthologies in the first place, and GOOD WITH HIS HANDS is a good example as to why.In MISS EXTREME CONGENIALITY by Erin McCarthy, CJ White and Wyatt Maddock fight like cats and dogs all the time. CJ even goes so far as to put in for a transfer but before she goesWyatt proposes spending one night together to get each other out of their systems. Will one night be enough?I loved the sparks that flew between CJ and Wyatt in SMART MOUTH and I was so happy to see them get their own story. CJ's son is also a adorable and so is her mom.In Morgan Leigh's LAST CALL, Tess Braeden has just moved to Justice, North Carolina when she inherits an old farmhouse. But when she arrives she finds that her house is slated to be demolished to make way for a new firehouse. She has tried time and again to get an appointment with the mayor but he has ignored her requests. Tess gets the suprise of her life when she realizes that the hunky mechanic she just locked lips with is the mayor Fletcher Graham. LAST CALL was so much fun and I just fell in love with Coop the bartender. If there is any justice, Coop will have his own story soon."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"Bad Boys In Black Tie has three immensely entertaining novellas by Lori Foster, Erin McCarthy and Morgan Leigh.Good With His Hands by Lori Foster gives us grown up Pete Watson with his own story. Pete's home and work life are interconnected to his neighbor Cassidy McClannahan. They have been buddies since Pete started to work at the same sport center. When they start to see each other in a new light, one steamy kiss changes it all. Pete and Cassidy are so laugh out loud funny. The steam they generate leaps off the page. Seeing Pete having his own story is so worth the wait.Erin McCarthy gives characters from her novel Smart Mouth, agents CJ White and Wyatt Maddock a chance to explore their relationship. CJ and Wyatt have butted heads from the get go. CJ is very by the book agent and has always made her feelings for Agent Wyatt know. Wyatt cannot figure out why is so attracted to this woman. He convinces her to spend one night with him. OH what a night it is. CJ and Wyatt are hysterically funny and knock your socks off steamy.Morgan Leigh's Last Call has a great mix of instant attraction and humor. Fletcher Graham is the mayor of Justice, NC. He is enthralled with the newcomer singing at the local bar, Last Call. The sexy man winking at her throws Tess Braeden for a loop. Tess is starting over in Justice trying to fix up the family home. Their first meeting is electric. Fletcher is keeping a huge secret from Tess that might change everything.This book is definitely a keeper. I loved all three stories."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"GOOD WITH HIS HANDS by Lori Foster was a great story that had fully developed characters and sexy loves scenes. I always enjoy Ms. Foster's books and I have been eagerly awaiting Pete's story. He has a very unique way of wearing a tie! I was pulled into this story from the first page and was sorry to see it end. MISS EXTREME CONGENIALITY by Erin McCarthy features two FBI agents who dislike each other and boy, sparks sure do fly when they get together! What a fun read! I thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry between Wyatt and CJ. Erin McCarthy has a way of writing stories that make you laugh out loud and want to root for the characters. I can't wait to read what Ms. McCarthy has in store for readers next. LAST CALL by Morgan Leigh really grabbed my interest and I fell in love with Fletcher, the sexy hero of this story. The scene where Tess and Fletcher first meet really sizzled.If you are looking for three entertaining, sensual love stories in one anthology, this is the book for you. You can't miss with anthology!"},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"In Lori Foster's 'Good With His Hands', we get Pete Watson's story. Pete's brothers stories are told in 'Bad Boys to Go' and 'Bad Boys on Board'. Pete and Cassidy are friends and neighbors who become something more. Ms Foster brings back Pete's brothers Gil and Sam to tease little brother. Cassidy has her life planned out and thinks she knows what she wants. Pete and Cassidy are a great couple. All I can say is that you will never look at a black tie in the same way again!!!!!Erin McCarthy's 'Miss Extreme Congeniality' has FBI agents CJ White and Wyatt Maddock working together on a case and getting together after hours. The sparks really fly between these 2!!In Morgan Leigh's 'Last Call', we meet Fletcher Graham and Tess Braeden. Fletcher and Tess meet in the small town where Fletcher is mayor. Add a bartender named Coop who is playing matchmaker and you have a very good read.These 3 stories were all laugh-out-loud funny and also touching at the same time. I have read Lori Fosters books before and have enjojed them. I have never read anything by Erin McCarthyor Morgan Leigh prior to this, but I will certainly look for other book by these talented authors."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"Anthologies are a great way to 'sample' an author and see if you like their writing style without buying a full length book. If you liked the other 'bad boy' anthologies, you won't be disappointed with this one. Foster, McCarthy and Leigh's contemporary shorts are very entertaining and full of steamy love scenes. A great way to spend a lazy afternoon.For anyone interested in Foster's story of Pete Watson, his brother's Gil Watson is in the Bad Boys To Go book and his other brother Sam Watson is in the Bad Boys on Board book."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"Good With His Hands by fav Lori Foster was very enjoyable with believable characters who were fun and easy to like. The secondary characters were also interesting; the descriptions of Cassidy's parents are, I think, reminiscent of everyone's parents. This was a fun, easy read with sweet characters and a warmly satisfying ending. Miss Extreme Congeniality by Erin McCarthy offers a fun look at the lives of two FBI agents who secretly wanteach other. CJ White has an autistic son that her co-workers don't know about and an ex-husband who left them because of the handicap; she is wary of letting any man too close. Wyatt Maddock wanted all of CJ - her body, her love, and her son, to be a part of his life. Hot sex and tender dialogue bring these two characters together - a very pleasing read. Last Call by Morgan Leigh is a real steamer! Hot characters who knew what they wanted and weren't afraid to go for it, until a misunderstanding comes between them and threatens to keep them apart. Love does prevail in this charming story; I found myself wishing for more pages when I reached the end. These three very talented ladies have done it again with a very enjoyable anthology that was fun and easy to read. Kudos!"},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"I really like a lot of the Bad Boys books, and Lori Foster and Erin McCarthy are two of my favorite authors, but this one fell short of the mark for me.Good With His Hands, by Lori FosterNext door neighbors Pete (Watson, brother to Gil and Sam) and Cassidy are good friends, but nothing more... until Pete decides he wants to mix things up a bit. But can their friendship withstand the heat?The sex in this one was fairly hot, but the characters were just so-so. I wasn't much moved by Pete's sudden sexual interest in Cassidy. Suddenly he started thinking about sex with her and couldn't stop. Less than a day later he 'realizes' he's in love with her. It was a lukewarm start and stayed weak throughout. Cassidy had been pining for Pete since they met, but her character just didn't impact me much. She wasn't super strong, sexy, or funny. Example: ' \\"You're a... a carouser.\\" Once she said it, she warmed to the topic. \\"A hound dog. A hedonist. You're never going to settle down.\\" ' Who seriously calls someone a carouser and a hound dog? A goober.Miss Extreme Congeniality, by Erin McCarthyFBI agent CJ has a chance to get what she wants - her sexy partner Wyatt out of her life for good. All she has to do is agree to one night of unbridled passion with him. But when the gloves finally come off, they'll both discover far more than they bargained for.This whole thing was a little much for me, from the silly premise to the fact that CJ and Wyatt manage to work together for so long without getting an accurate read on each other, yet manage to be really hot for each other, then after just a few hours together suddenly get each other really well. CJ is a bit of an uptight snob, and although we do learn why, I didn't feel like McCarthy did a good job of getting the reader to sympathise with her. It's not awful, but McCarthy can do better than this.Last Call, by Morgan LeighTess Braden is new in town and she has a problem - the home she just inherited is about to be foreclosed on, and the elusive mayor refuses to grant her an appointment to plead her case. At least there's hottie Fletcher Graham to brighten her day, but what will Tess do when she finds out Fletcher's real job?I admit, I'm not a big fan of Morgan Leigh. Romance, no matter how hot it gets, is predominantly about the love between the hero and heroine. Leigh's work tends to feel more like written porn. She will tell the reader the characters are in love, but the showing is lacking. The lack is subtle, but it's there.Exacerbating that, in this case, is the fact that less than twenty four hours after they meet, Tess is trying to convince herself she's not in love with Fletcher, when of course she is. The pacing is all wrong, Fletcher makes assumptions about Tess that cause him to act like a jerk, and the whole thing is chock full of exclamation marks and Gawd!s. In short, the writing and the storytelling are both just not up to snuff."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"Good with His Hands was funny and hot. Loved the addition of the parents. May never look at a black tie again without thinking of the final scene.Miss Extreme Congeniality - both C.J and Wyatt have some baggage. C.J. goes from nice to witchy rather quickly (see hot tube scene). Aside from the witchyness I liked the hot tube scene. Thought it was kind of odd that he didn't know she had a child and he slept with her underwear under his pillow. Overall pretty hot though.Last Call is all about not telling the full truth. I think Tess let Fletcher off the hook pretty easy. All in all though I thought he proved himself to be a pretty good guy. Not as hot as the others but the story is better."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"I can't believe I waited this long to read Pete's story by Lori Foster (GOOD WITH HIS HANDS)!! I read it in one sitting recently, it was fabulous. Ms. Foster's book was just a intense romance! I love reading stories about friends to lovers and too that they can be both. It too was sensual and just a perfect couple for Cassidy and Pete. Too, McCarthy and Leigh's stories are the first I ever read by them. Now I plan to read more of them!"},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"I love the Brava Bad Boys series! Bad Boys in Black Tie was one of the better ones. It starts with Lori Foster's story which is about Cassidy and Pete. This one was my least favorite of the three and involved two co-workers and friends who decide to become more. It was just ok. Erin McCarthy's story was my favorite and had better plot development. It involves Wyatt and CJ, two characters introduced in Smart Mouth. Erin McCarthy is one of my favorite authors. Working together, Wyatt decides he wants to get to know CJ better. CJ is the type that hides behind clothes and Wyatt is determine to find out what she is hiding even if it means that he has to transfer to another job. I really liked Wyatt! McCarthy writes the best heroes. Morgan Leigh's story involves Tess and Fletcher. Tess is the new girl in town who has inherited a run-down home from her grandfather. She has been trying for several months to get the mayor of the town to see her to no avail so that she can get the place declared as an historical home. One night the mayor (Fletcher) hears her sing at a bar that he co-owns and he is hooked, line and sinker. The only thing is that he doesn't tell Tess who he really is and wait until she finds out on her own. This was a cute story although things moved really fast for Tess and Fletcher. Of course, that does happen sometimes with anthology stories. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"Hmmm. This book was just okay. I love Lori Foster.

Well, I really enjoyed this story, which is # 3 in the Watson Brothers, and believe me I'll go back and read the rest. It was cute, funny, sexy and hot. There's the girl next door, Cassidy, who's a bit of a tomboy, doesn't worry too much about how she dresses or what her hair looks like. She works with, and now lives next door to, hunky and to-die-for hot Pete Watson. They've been best friends for over a year, they have a great routine together, almost as if they're married, but it's not sexual between them. Until Pete decides that he wants it to be sexual. And of course, Cassidy had been drooling over him the whole time and torturing herself by being so close and not having him so she's all for the idea of them together. Pete was just too cute. The guy just had no clue sometimes about things and it was adorable to see him wonder how his charms might not be working on Cassidy. She's the girl with the plan of where her life is going and what kind of guy she wants to marry. And that guy is so not him. But maybe he can make the effort and be what he feels her ideal is. Or make her realize that she wants him instead as he is. Because he realizes he's been falling for her this whole time.Miss Extreme Congeniality - 3.5 StarsI'll tell you what with this Erin McCarthy story. It was hot! The sexual tension was there constantly BUT I was not sold on the heroine of the novel, nor was I sold on how quickly they \\"fell for each other\\". Let me explain. CJ and White are undercover cops on a case. They've been working this case for a while and she just hates his guts, she thinks he's a playboy chasing after skirts and has no respect for him as a person. But she wants him. Wyatt on the other hand seems to not have noticed her much, she gives off a very don't-mess-with-me vibe and he's kept his distance. So they haven't had a chance to even get to know each other in the slightest. Then one night while on assignment working at a party they decide to have sex. As a deal. She will go to Wyatts' house for an all-night sex-fest and then after that he will transfer to another city when they're done with the case. But it turns out that the wild night of passion turns into I love yous. But still a very hot story and an enjoyable read.Last Call by Morgan Leigh - 3 StarsTess is a singer at a local bar in Justice, North Carolina. She's recently moved to the town (and I'm not telling you why). One night she catches the eye of a really good looking, if a bit rough and greasy at the moment, bad boy. Fletcher felt that connection, lust and need, at first sight. Recently divorced from his gold digging wife, he's still a bit careful with women but he can't not go after Tess that night. But he's keeping a secret from her. Tess and Fletcher definitely have sexual chemistry, but here's another I-love-you-the-morning-after-I-met-you situation. I think I would've been happier to see them have a happy for now ending to this story. Personal choice."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"I'm a huge Lori Foster fan - loved it!

Anything by this Author is a great read."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"I'll start by confessing that I AM NOT a Lori Foster fan, and I always think hers are the weakest stories in the Bad Boys anthologies. This book was no different. The sad thing about Foster is that her short stories are actually better than her full novels. I also thought Morgan Leigh's \\"Last Call\\" was incredibly stupid, with an awful plot and boring characters. Erin McCarthy was the best of the lot. No, it was not great literature, but at least her characters were compelling. Bottom line: I'm glad I checked this one out at the library."},{"Title":"Bad Boys in Black Tie","review":"This is a great book to take to the beach, Lori Foster never writes a bad book. And I found 2 new to me authors that I will be buying from now on."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"Although Lawrence's writings are noted for more earthly activities, he shows a surprising knowledge of Biblical matters. In this book he analyzes the last book of the Bible-- Revelations-- and not too favorably at that. I cannot argue with his facts because I am not as familiar with them as as he is. What I find fascinating about this essay-book are his observations on democracy, and especially about life.The last page or two contain one of his most remarkable and inspiring observations about the individual and his soul. Lawrence often argues that you cannot &quot;save&quot; you soul; you must &quot;live&quot; it. Near the end of this book he writes:&quot;What man most passionately want is his living wholeness and his living unison, not his own isolate salvation of his &quot;soul.&quot; Man wants his physical fulfilment first and foremost, since now, once and once only, he is in the flesh and potent. For man, the vast marvel is to be alive. For man, as for flower and beast and bird, the supreme triumph is to be most vividly, most perfectly alive. Whatever the unborn and the dead may know, they cannot know the beauty, the marvel of being alive in the flesh. The dead may look after the afterwards. But the magnificent here and now of life in the flesh is ours, and ours alone, and ours only for a time. We ought to dance with rapture that we should be alive and in the flesh, and part of the living, incarnate cosmos....I am part of the great whole, and I can never escape. But I can deny my connections, break them, and become a fragment. Then I am wretched.&quot;The most poignant phrase in this passage is &quot;...and ours for a short time only.&quot; Lawrence lived a shorter time that most of us will, but in his lifetime his output was as perceptive and prodigious as any author who has ever written. Scattered throughout this book are irritating but illuminating thoughts like: &quot;But a democracy is bound in the end to be obscene, for it is composed of myriad disunited fragments, each fragment assuming to itself a false wholeness, a false individuality. Modern democracy is made up of millions of frictional parts all asserting their own wholeness.&quot;Some people have taken that statement as proof that Lawrence is against democracy. But I consider it a valid danger for democracy, one that is being played out in the press every day. To preserve democracy, the best of all possible forms of government, we have to analyze and try to correct its failings and weaknesses.Puzzle your way through this book. I hope you will find it as rewarding as I did."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"Written in response to widespread condemnation of the sexuality and libertine lifestyles presented in his books, Apocalypse was the final attempt by D. H. Lawrence to make himself understood. The modern reader will probably detect a full throttle blitz against the puritanical deacons of the Church of England and his establishment tormentors. Launched from the most contentious and abstruse of the Bible's books, Revelation, Lawrence levels his antipathy at a rigid, superficially moral, life denying exposition of Christian thought. He argues that the confining nature of living the 'good' life in expectation of reward in Heaven cuts to the root of an immensely rich potential for experience and passion presented in the world. He continuously falls back on opaque codices-- of arcane civilizations that he states more fully explored the metaphysical realm. Lawrence divines a heroic age where apparent creation and destiny were seen as integral and complete. Robert Graves's 'The White Goddess' comprehensively analyzes the same mythological, magical architecture, but Lawrence uses it in a much more targeted and critical way.Lawrence saw the aesthetic brilliance of Revelation as a bridge to a more mysterious, immediate, compelling theology. At the same time he condemns the apocalyptic churches who interpret the book as the evocation of Hell and Judgement, rather than in its potent poetic symbolism. He goes so far as to accuse John of Patmos of not presenting a revelation at all, but of appropriating a truer, more ancient historiography for eccliastical and political reasons. Not above placing his own eccentric opinions of government in this tract, he could be accused of mounting his own pulpit, if with literary distinction. His claim of an affirming devotion to the visible universe as the only 'true' route to the holy can be countered by reading some of the lively writings of Christian ascetics. This treatise, however, is not about them. It is aimed squarely at the convention seeking, socially regulating, sanctimonious attitudes that had censored and prosecuted him. Not surprisingly it did not raise his stock much among his critics, but it is an essential text in understanding the underlying motives behind his works."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"Attacks everything blindly and madly promoted by the dominant ideas of the dominant socio-economic classes and strongest institutionalized influences in the current civilization of inauthenticity and death.The power of money must go, according to Lawrence, as the power of the sun must return--as it indeed has always been the power of life whether we recognize it or not. Also, the power of blood must be reasserted. As human beings we are connected to all things. However, this perspective is suppressed as it constitutes a threat to the status quo.Lawrence here sees no salvation in either democracy or western monotheism; but solely in human beings connecting up once again to the universal forces of nature from which come life's vitality."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"This book is an interpretation of John of Patmos's \`Apocalypse' along the lines of Nietzsche's philosophy: the will-to-power, aristocracy v. democracy, Christianity as a destroyer of paganism and the fruits of the earth, anti-reason and anti-science stances.Man, the will-to-power\`Man wants his physical fulfillment first, the marvel of being alive in the flesh, to be part of the cosmic life of vitality, potency, prowess and power. Cosmic power is phallic power (fertility).'\`The primal, old-Adamic need in a man's soul is to be master, lord.'Aristocracy v. DemocracyAn aristocrat acts from a position of strength, a democrat from a position of weakness.\`Socialists hate all free, upstanding, daunting men. A democracy is bound to be obscene, composed of false individualities.'Anti-reason, anti-scienceFor D.H. Lawrence, the Logos is the evil snake. Man's fall is the fall into knowledge'\`The final condition of science, of modern physics and physicists is a naked and disembodied universe. The atom has turned into nothingness.'Christianity, paganismChristianity is a \`thou-shalt-not' doctrine. It denies the body and creates misery out of vital want. It is the religion of \`death', of the dead body and the postponed reward.The old religions were cults of vitality, potency and power. They were religions of \`life'.Christianity destroyed paganism in the Western world.The Apocalypse (Revelation)The first part of the book calls for a renewed world under the Messiah.The second half is full of hate of worldly power. It expresses a lust for the end of the world. It is the equivalent of suicide with subsequent self-glorification. Therefore, indirectly, it is the revelation of the undying will-to-power, its final triumph: \`if the entire universe has to be destroyed, still, O Christian, you shall reign as a king and set your foot on the necks of the old bosses.'This book is an original (but one of the many) analysis of the message(s) hidden in John of Patmos's book.But D.H. Lawrence's Nietzschean condemnations of science, reason and democracy are totally unacceptable.Only for H.H. Lawrence fans and \`Apocalypse' scholars."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"My first exposure to D.H. Lawrence is the short story, \\"The Rocking-Horse Winner\\", I have read in middle school. As a kid, I enjoyed reading this short story. I had not the attention span nor the desire to read something longer, the novel. I had to learn something about the author of a story I enjoyed, so I read a short biography on Wikipedia. I loved the few lines of a short poem referenced there, \\"O the stale old dogs who pretend to guard, the morals of the masses, how smelly they make the great back-yard, wetting after everyone that passes.\\" (Excerpt, \\"The Young and Their Moral Guardians\\"). He has great insight into the deceictfulness and self-righteous of the proudful, pompious, self-serving aristocracy. But what he says in this book is nothing new to a theologian. God elevated man by taking on the cloak of the flesh. And, so many heavenly glories can be won here, in a very short time, to experience for all eternity. In no other way, can a person give glory to God than by suffering for Him. And we can only suffer in the flesh - for a short time, before we die. I haven't read Lawrence's last book, but he was definitely on to something. For those who wish to know the rest of his story, read the Bible. But as Lawrence realizes, the answers are not found in reading - but living - alive in Living Faith. Only Jesus has the power to save."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"If you question authority (and organized religion), this book is a must for your collection... a real classic!"},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"This is easily one of the most insightful and profound books I have read in my life. Both the conservative Christian and the man of pure science will despise this book. But if you have an open mind, prepare to have it blown against the wall. Lawrence understands human spiritually like a prophet and conveys his insights in blasts of crystal clarity. This is my first experience with him and I can guarantee he will be a lifelong favorite."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"You can get this kind of thought if you really spend time with Nietzsche or Deleuze, but very rarely is it possible to find deep thought written by a master of the English language. There is nuance here - and Lawrence would be the first to advise care - but if you can't learn from this book then you are missing out."},{"Title":"Apocalypse","review":"The greatness of Lawrence as a writer is not in question. But in this final work of his , we see a 'visionary ' side which involves a neo- Neitzschean and almost Fascist reading of ' the Book of Revelations'. Lawrence may as other reviewers claim be here most interested in defying a pagan life- affirming tradition against a spiritually dehumanizing Christianity. But the main thrust is in his condemnation, a very strange one indeed, of the poor of the world for their envy of those higher people, the true aristocrats of life. Borrowing a page from Nietzsche's conception of re-sentiment morality he condemns the poor and sees their anger as barren and empty. So too his reading of John of Patmos condemns him for dessicating the life in a false and distorted spiritual vision.Lawrence's work comes most alive far from theory, in his novels especially but also in his poems.In terms of pure ideas his contribution , at least in this work, is more negative than anything else."},{"Title":"New World History and Geography: Review Maps B (A Beka Book)","review":"I needed this book to complete the set for homeschooling.Glad to have found it,because I couldn't find it anywhere else."},{"Title":"Map of Kaua'i","review":"I bought this map on Amazon and it was a good basic starter map for our 10 day trip to Kauai. Ironically, it was the only map we saw available when we first arrived and in many cases what I paid on Amazon was much cheaper then the price for the same thing on Kauai itself! However, if you really want to travel around Kauai and are going to be looking for specific streets, you need something much more detailed then this map has to offer."},{"Title":"Map of Kaua'i","review":"I purchased two similar maps of Kauai: \\"Franko's Kauai Guide Map\\"Franko's Kauai Guide Mapand James Bier \\"Map of Kauai.\\" Both have the same scale, approximately1:160,000 or 1 mile = 0.40 inches. Both show more detail than my AAA Hawaii map (which covers all islands).The Franko's map is copyright 2007 while Map of Kauai, 7th edition was copyrighted 2004 by University of Hawaii Press. Unfolded, the Franko map is 21x14 inches (53x36cm) and Map of Kauai is 22x15 inches (56x39cm). The Franko map uses water-proof, tear-resistant material while Map of Kauai is printed on heavy paper that is not water-proof or tear-resistant.Both maps use shading to show mountains and valleys. The perimeter of the Franko map is filled with text describing points of interest. Each POI has 2-4 sentences with a line connecting the text to a map location. There is a lot of useful information on the Franko map but the text is small and you can't scan the map to pick out points of interest - you need to stop and carefully read. The Franko map is dark and it's difficult to read the small print on the map. Map of Kauai is a \\"cleaner\\" design that makes it easier to quickly read.Both maps have inserts that show more detail of urban areas. On the Franko map, the reverse side has detail of the North Shore, East Shore, South Shore, and Na Pali Coast & Kokee Hiking. On the front of the Map of Kauai are inserts of Kapaa and Lihue while the reverse has an insert of Poipu. Also on the reverse of Map of Kauai is a good index of more than 1000 points of interest and streets.I'm a map geek and I like both maps. The Franko map is useful for planning what you want to see and do while Map of Kauai is handier to have as a navigational aid. If I had to pick one, Map of Kauai fits my needs better.

Witherington is reverant, responsible, thorough, and often brilliant. The book is rich in observations, insights, and well supported conclusions about all aspects of the texts. I'm especially concerned with this subject matter because it seems to me that \\"the woman's movement\\" has caused a crisis for some traditional Christians today. Witherington is absolutely right to insist that, on these issues, the Bible should have its say. Indeed, yes, the Bible should have its say. Readers will find this not only immensely satisfying but enjoyable; it's profound writing for the mainstream. One might want to buy several copies of this book and, politely, offer them to friends, ministers and priests. Highly recommended. I also recommend Craig S. Keener's Paul, Women & Wives. --- [...]."},{"Title":"Women and the Genesis of Christianity","review":"Witherington looks at women not as they are sometimes read into the New Testament, but as they are portrayed by New Testament writers. In this way he allows the Bible to address contemporary concerns rather than serve partisan purposes. The result is rich and surprisingly revolutionary. Jesus, Paul, and the Gospel writers move well beyond the limits of their own and surrounding societies in their respect for women and their vision for women in the new reality of God's kingdom. They do so on their own terms and within their actual context, rather than as advocates for anyone's contemporary agenda.I found myself both glad for this readable overview and wishing for the more complete background and documentation of his more extensive works on women in the ministry of Jesus and the First Century Church."},{"Title":"Women and the Genesis of Christianity","review":"The book was in great condition!

The sections discuss Light, Artificial Light, HID Lamps, Reflectors, Setup, and Electricity Basics. Appendices include Radiant Energy, Requirements of Plants, Troubleshooting, Types of Lamps, Glossary, and Index.The book is a mixed bag of great information and cluttered lists of data. The major theme of the book wanders about. Some of the discussions contradict each other. For example, Van Patten does a masterful job describing why useful light for plants should not be measured in lumens. But then he goes ahead and displays his huge listing of light readings in lumens. Why? You made your point, use PAR Watts.In another section, Van Patten decribes every possible detail about horticultural lamps and reflector systems, but draws no summary with a specific list of brands and models. Don't get me wrong, he lists lots of data. Pages and pages of spreadsheet like lumen data for over 115 models of bulbs. Pages and pages of 54 three dimensional charts. Yah, great, you did lots of research - but I don't need to see all the raw data. Just tell me which bulb I should buy. Maybe give me a top ten list. Should I really care what the lumens are for the 97th best bulb?Many conclusions are very vague. For example Van Patten actually writes, &quot;we still do not know which lamp is best&quot;. Gee, that a great reason to write a book.I'm torn as how to rate this book. The book contains many jewels of information that are well researched and finely written. Some of Van Patten's findings are exciting, extremely interesting, and even thought provolking. But in between is a littered jumble of confusing tables and charts. It's disorganized. There are lots of typographical errors throughout. He should have hired a book editor before publishing this (or hired a smarter one).If you plan to garden indoors with HID lights, you must buy this book (you have no other choice but this book, because there are no other texts available). The book is most valuable to purchase BEFORE you select a HID system. It will save you from making a costly mistake.PS: I use two HID lamps, a 400 watt Agrosun and a 400 watt Sunmaster Warm Deluxe. Both are installed in identical Hydrofarm Super Grow Wing Systems. I love the results - I can grow anything!"},{"Title":"Gardening Indoors with H.I.D. Lights","review":"&quot;Gardening Indoors with HID Lights&quot; is a cross between a technical manuscript and an How To book for beginners. With a bachelors in cellular biology, this book was perfect for me. It explained how plants react to different parts of the light spectrum for different parts of their growth cycle. It steered me away from what would have been an ineffective fluorescent to maintain my citrus trees during the snowy winter. Instead the authors skillfully discuss the relationship of cost, watts, and effective indoor growth area for what is essentially artificial sunlight. As a novice, I decided not to take all their advice about an indoor lighting system, since I wasn't sure it would really work as advertised. But the practical science which is woven throughout this book would have been an equally effective guide for a much more elaborate set up. The salesperson where I ended up purchasing my HID system did not recommend this book since it was &quot;too technical.&quot; I myself would recommend this book to anyone who studies their gardening and purchases other garden books. A high intensity discharged lighting system will cost several hundred dollars. My system had no information with it guide me in it's use.

Originally planned as a continuation of Charles Patton Dimitry?s _Louisiana Families_ series (published in 1892), the authors augmented that work by extending the coverage to English, Scots, and Irish family lines, as well as adding French and Spanish families omitted by Dimitry. There's a great deal of compiled material here, but no source citations. It would also have been useful to include an every-name index in place of the original index which lists only &quot;stem&quot; surnames.

However, Dr. Moon does not discuss non-Asians pretending to be Asian until one of the last chapters of the book. This text really dealt with non-Chinese artistic responses to the Chinese and Chinese Americans and those two groups' counter response. Most cultural studies focuses upon visual art or writings because any modern can read a book or use their eyes to analyze something. However, and surprisingly, the focus in this book is on music. Moon is knowledgeable about Chinese instruments and musical writing. Music majors may be especially appreciative of this text.This text must be a celebration of tenure, because I can't imagine a graduate student being able to pick up so much for a dissertation. Further, this tenure is well-deserved: it must have taken a lot to be a professor in Georgia and pull up so much historical evidence from San Francisco and New York City. Sometimes the text is repetitive, but the reader can still notice that it took a lot of hard work to pull together and analyze all this material.This book does not treat \\"white\\" and \\"yellow\\" exclusively; Native Americans, African-Americans, and even Eurasians are brought up. Still, at one point Dr. Moon mentions a Black vaudevillian who take on the name Ding-a-Ling. She totally fails to recognize the racialized phallocentricity here.Dr. Moon is great at not seeing things as absolutes. The time periods of the chapters overlap, as history actually doesn't have sharp beginnings and endings. English Americans first dismiss Chinese music as \\"noise\\" but by comparing it to Scottish music, they recognize its musicality, at least somewhat. Chinese music is seen as primitive by the white Americans mentioned here, yet they also use it to innovate or rejuvenate Western music. Non-Chinese Americans deem the Chinese as perpetual foreigners, but Chinese Americans resist that label by mastering both Occidental and Oriental musical styles.This book moves slowly, just like most history and academic books. Still, it may be a great tool for ethnic studies majors and many other learners."},{"Title":"The self life and the Christ life,","review":"J.C.Ryle sent out a clarion call in his day to a church that was becoming increasingly worldly.

A.E. Taylor is a true guide to what Plato actually says and provides useful classical context that will keep out the most egregious error. This is an essential volume in any philosopher's library.One of the greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato instigated groundbreaking inquiries into morality, ethics, and the quest for happiness that continue to inform and influence philosophical discussion today. In this outstanding work of scholarship, a renowned expert on Plato presents a scrupulously accurate historical view of the great philosopher's life and works. Distinguished by its dispassionate scholarly analysis, Professor Taylor's discourse is refreshingly free of the biases that have frequently tainted other studies.A brief introductory chapter acquaints readers with the known events of Plato's life. The author then proceeds to an illuminating examination of the philosopher's voluminous writings, including the minor Socratic dialogues, as well as such major works as Phaedo, Symposium, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedrus, Timaeus, Laws, and other influential dialogues. The final chapter, \\"Plato in the Academy,\\" attempts to pin down?with the help of some of Plato's former students, such as Aristotle the philosopher's beliefs about numbers. In a substantial appendix, \\"The Platonic Apocrypha,\\" Professor Taylor examines writings that have sometimes been attributed to Plato, including several letters, and offers cogent reasons for accepting or rejecting them as Plato's work.Praised by Dean William R. Inge of Theology as \\"a great book, an honour to . . . British scholarship,\\" this volume is an invaluable guide for students, teachers, and other readers interested in philosophy."},{"Title":"Plato;: The Man and His Work","review":"This review departs to some degree from the traditional amazon review. For those who are simply trying to decide whether to purchase this book or not I suggest ignoring my review and looking to the other reviews. I will list some of the pros and cons of this book as I see them but my review is aimed more towards those with a serious interest in Plato as opposed to those who are simply looking for a basic introduction to some of Plato's ideas.I think Taylor's book is worth reading whatever camp you fall in (despite some flaws). If you are new to Plato and are just looking for an introduction this book is probably as good as any and if you are a serious Plato enthusiast Taylor is still worth reading despite being a bit dated.I should also point out that I am not a Plato scholar so my review should be read as what it is: a review by a graduate student in philosophy with an interest in Plato but no real credentials.The first pro of this book is that it is one of the only books that deals with every single Platonic dialogue (I know Catherine Zuckert's bookPlato's Philosophers: The Coherence of the Dialoguesdoes as well but I have not read it yet). It is, therefore, good for anyone who is looking for analyses of some of the dialogues that are not treated as often in the secondary literature. This also allows A.E. Taylor to provide a unified portrait of the Platonic philosophy and to highlight themes which appear in all, or most, of the dialogues.One con of Taylor's method, in my opinion, is that he attempts to follow a chronological reading of Plato based on stylometric dating. Personally I think that the attempts to date Plato's writings stylometrically are seriously flawed (there is some evidence that Plato continually reworked his dialogues throughout his life which would make any stylistic chronology impossible).Unfortunately there is probably no other doctrine neutral way to date the Platonic dialogues (and any chronology based on doctrinal changes would wind up being circular). For the reader who is interested in this problem I suggest taking a look at the article \\"Re-reading Plato: the Problem of Platonic Chronology\\" by Jacob Howland. Not only does Howland argue that all attempts to provide a chronology of the Platonic corpus are seriously flawed but he also argues that this is not in anyway a hindrance since the interpretative method of reading the dialogues in conjunction with each other, so that they are each able to shed light on each other, tends to produce deeper and more interesting interpretations than the interpretations which attempt to determine the \\"development\\" of Plato's ideas based on a chronological reading. It might be helpful to give an example of what I mean. One of Plato's most famous doctrines is that knowledge is recollection. In the Phaedo Cebes describes this doctrine in this way, \\"According to this, [the doctrine that learning is recollection] we must at some previous time have learned what we now recollect. This is possible only if our soul existed somewhere before it took on this human shape. So according to this theory too, the soul is likely to be something immortal\\" (72e). Cebes takes the theory about learning being recollection to be a proof of the immortality of the soul. I have been told by those who read Greek that in this passage and the lines following Plato is contrasting and playing with the distinction between recollection (anamnesis) and memory (mneme) and that Cebes misunderstands recollection in terms of memory (something we have known at a previous time in a temporal sense rather than the a priori in the more modern sense). We can see this misunderstanding if we compare what Plato says about recollection in other dialogues. In the Phaedrus Socrates says, \\"a human being must understand speech in terms of general forms, proceeding to bring many perceptions together into a reasoned unity. That process is the recollection of the things our soul saw when it was traveling with god\\" (249c). Here we see that recollection is not the memory of things we saw in the past but rather the gathering of many perceptions under one common form. Plato, of course, still speaks of this mythically as 'when we were traveling with god' but it would be a mistake to take Plato's myths literally (it would take me too far afield to explain why I believe that). The point of all of this is that in order to pinpoint the mistake Cebes makes in regard to recollection as an error we have to read the dialogues together. We could say that the Phaedo is an earlier dialogue and that Plato changed his mind. But we have very little, if any, evidence for doing so (why could the Phaedo not be later than the Phaedrus in which case everything would be reversed) and we would have a much more impoverished understanding of a fundamental Platonic doctrine (the notion that learning is recollection); whereas if we read the dialogues together they are able to shed light on each other and give us a much fuller understanding of Platonic philosophy.There is also some evidence that Plato himself composed the dialogues in terms of tetralogies and there is clearly a dramatic narrative tying many of the dialogues together. It seems more logical to me to read the dialogues in terms of the succession Plato himself devised rather than relying on a dubious chronology (I believe Zuckert follows this method in her book and Joseph Cropsey follows the same method in his bookPlato's World: Man's Place in the Cosmos).A.E. Taylor wrote this book at a time when it was still widely believed that we could make some fairly solid pronouncements about the chronology of the Platonic dialogues and this becomes a central part of Taylor's interpretations since he believes, \\"To understand a great thinker is, of course, impossible unless we know something of the relative order of his works\\" (pg16). While this is, I believe, a flaw of Taylor's method it is not a terribly serious one and I believe most of what he says about Plato does not depend for its validity on the validity of his chronology. This should not be a reason to entirely avoid Taylor, therefore, but should be kept in mind while reading.Another con of Taylor's book, which is also a pro to some degree, is his tendency to read Plato anachronistically. There are two main ways in which he does this. The first is that he tends to read Plato in terms of Christianity, as for example, when he writes, \\"the ideal of Socrates and the Christian ideal are fundamentally identical\\" (pg192) or \\"The conception set before us in these pages is manifestly the Hellenic counterpart of the 'mystical way' of Christianity\\" (pg181). The good part about all this is that Taylor definitely recognizes a religious dimension to Plato's thought which is not always recognized by analytic interpretations of his philosophy but which is essential to a genuine understanding of Plato. When Plato claims that the objects of thought are the truly real in contrast to the objects of sense perception he is not simply devising a theory about predication, or the status of universals, and when he argues for the superiority of thought over sense-perception he is not simply making an epistemological argument about the sources of our knowledge. These doctrines are tied to what we might call a doctrine of salvation, or a doctrine about the ultimate human good. This becomes clear in the Phaedo where Plato argues, \\"the soul of every man, when it feels violent pleasure or pain in connection with some object, inevitably believes at the same time that what causes such feelings must be very clear and very true, which it is not...every pleasure and every pain provides, as it were, another nail to rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together\\" (83c-e). Taylor recognizes this religious dimension in Plato which puts him above many analytic commentators on Plato (an analytic philosopher might abstract the arguments about the immortality of the soul from the Phaedo and attempt to determine their validity without recognizing the Phaedo as a dialogue about how the philosopher should live in order to achieve the ultimate human good). But ultimately I think Plato's ideas have more in common with his own religious context (Orphism, Pythagoreanism, and even, perhaps Indian religions) than they do with Christianity. Taylor's reading of Christian ideas back into Plato leads to at least some distortion (this statement has to be qualified to some degree since Christian writers incorporated a great many of Plato's insights into Christianity which is almost certainly the reason for the similarities that do exist between them but the problem arises when the similarities are reflected backwards rather than forwards, i.e. when Christianity is read back into Plato rather than Plato being read forward into Christianity).The other way in which Taylor reads Plato anachronistically is the way he tends to see modern debates reflected in the debates taking place within Plato's dialogues (like the debate over the epiphenomenality of consciousness). In some ways it is good that Taylor reads current debates (at least current at the time Taylor was writing) back into Plato. It allows us to see the almost miraculous way Plato was able to anticipate nearly every important philosophical question in the entire history of Western philosophy.And there is certainly nothing wrong with reading Plato in the light of our current concerns. I think one of the reasons Plato speaks to us today is because he was, in a way, living in a time analogous to our own. We often tend to think of Plato as living at the beginning of Greek civilization because our historical record becomes scanty as we move backwards from Plato (particularly in the dark ages after the Mycenaean collapse but before the classical age). But in reality Plato was closer to the end of Greek civilization. The Greek religions were losing their hold on young minds who were filled with new scientific ideas (one sees this in a number of the dialogues: one sees it in the Pythagoreans Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo who are already ignorant of the religious aspects of the Pythagorean school to which they belong, one sees it in the new scientific explanations that are being offered for the old myths as in the story of Boreas in the Phaedrus, one sees it in the demands made for rational defenses of the superiority of justice in the Republic since the religious injunctions are losing some of their force.). We too live in an age where a religion which has existed for two thousand years is beginning to lose its hold to some degree in the face of new scientific ideas. Plato was such a giant, I think, because he held onto both ends of the chain at once. He did not entirely abandon the religious teachings of the past but he rescued them from their mythical form and presented them in a form that was acceptable to the more scientifically minded (perhaps we are waiting for something similar). For an example of what I mean we can again turn to the Phaedo where Plato has Socrates say, \\"It is likely that those who established the mystic rites for us were not inferior persons but were speaking in riddles long ago...There are indeed, as those concerned with the mysteries say, many who carry the thyrsus but the Bacchants are few. These latter are, in my opinion, no other than those who have practiced philosophy in the right way\\" (69c-d). Plato does not reject the old mystery religions outright - he merely rejects their literal interpretation (if the reader is interested in my personal opinion I think the modern atheists make the same mistake when rejecting Christianity that Plato seems to be arguing against in this passage- that is, they view Christianity as if it was just uttering nonsense rather than speaking in riddles which have to be deciphered - they think that when they have rejected the literal truth of the stories of the Bible, for example, that they have thereby refuted Christianity). I think that Taylor sees all of this fairly clearly as well and he is to be applauded for that.But Taylor's method of reading Plato in terms of the subsequent history of philosophy, or of translating Plato's arguments and ideas into the terms of more modern philosophers is no longer the preferred method of reading Plato (for example, when he says that \\"for Socrates and Plato, no less than for Kant, immortality is a postulate of the 'practical' use of 'reason' (pg207), or, when he uses the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction in scholastic philosophy to explain arguments from the Phaedo (pg204)). These interpretations are not necessarily incorrect and certainly help the reader familiar with Kant and scholastic terminology to understand Plato's point but we can no longer assume that something as simple as the translation of Plato into Latin was in anyway 'innocent' or left the substance of Plato's theories intact. We can no longer simply read backward and assume that the tradition as it has been handed down to us, and which has been derived in large part from Plato, accurately represents Plato's own thought. I think Heidegger is largely responsible for awakening us in this regard because despite Heidegger's many flaws (both personal and philosophical) he really made an attempt to go back and read the Greeks on their own terms (before all the Greek terms had been translated into their Latin versions, and before the problems Plato was dealing with had been solidified in the tradition). Heidegger really is responsible for a revolution in the way we read Plato, at least in the Continental tradition, and Taylor's book seems a bit dated in comparison in my opinion. For the reader who is interested in some readings of Plato that I think are superior to Taylor's in this respect I would recommendPlato's Sophist (Studies in Continental Thought)by Martin Heidegger,Being and Logos: Reading the Platonic Dialoguesby John Sallis,Self-Knowledge in Plato's Phaedrusby Charles Griswold jr.,Plato's Parmenides: The Conversion of the Soulby Mitchell Miller jr.,Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture Volume I: Archaic Greece: The Mind of Athensby Werner Jaeger (the second volume is the volume on Plato but it will not let me link to it directly; just click on the little plus sign by the paperback version and it will expand and show all three volumes), andOrder and History (Volume 3): Plato and Aristotle (Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 16)by Eric Voegelin.Two more books I have read on Plato since I first wrote this review that I thought were excellent and definitely worth mentioning are:Plato and the Good: Illuminating the Darkling Vision (Philosophy of History and Culture)by Rosemary Desjardins. Desjardins offers a really interesting and exciting interpretation of Plato's metaphysics, which is, in many ways, quite different from the standard interpretations of Plato's metaphysics that you get in standard introductions, but which I think has a great deal of textual support in its favor. The other book isToward a New Interpretation of Platoby Giovanni Reale. Reale was part of the Tubingen school so he attempts to read Plato in light of the unwritten tradition but his interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is quite similar to Desjardins' in a number of ways.As a final word I will simply repeat what I said at the beginning: despite the flaws of Taylor's book which I have attempted to spell out in this review I think his book is still worth reading. Taylor is a good writer, he gets a lot right, and many of his interpretations are very thought-provoking. I simply suggest that the reader keep some of the limitations of Taylor's book in mind while reading."},{"Title":"Plato;: The Man and His Work","review":"If you want to understand Plato, I can heartily recommend a two-step process.First, read up on him in Copleston'sA History of Philosophy, Vol. 1: Greece and Rome From the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus. You would probably want to read about the pre-Socratics and the Sophists as well.Then, get yourself a copy of this book, and go through it, dialogue by dialogue. I don't think you can go far wrong, and you will have a firm understanding of one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived --- well, two, if you count Socrates!"},{"Title":"Plato;: The Man and His Work","review":"This book is 550 pages plus many footnotes which adds the equivalent of 20 or 30 more pages. It is not light reading lets put it that way. But if you can persevere and get through it you will learn a lot about Plato.The emphasis is on 'the work' rather than 'the man'. Taylor recommended biographies by Grote, E. Meyer, and his hero Professor Burnet if you want those biographical details.I read this book over an extended period of time while finishing quite a few other books in between. Having to read this book quickly like for a college class would in my opinion be a form of mental torture. There's too much information.I had already read some of Plato's dialogues plus the Timaeus and Critias, The Republic, and The Laws. Taylor's book is a good review and overview of those plus many others although The Republic is only talked about at a high level.Taylor saw three main phases of Plato's life:1) early writings which include the Socratic dialogues and some other books2) Academy period where writing slowed down a lot3) later writings which include The LawsThe Socratic dialogues were apparently written to preserve information about Socrates and may have been based on actual conversations with Soc.I still do not understand what the motivations were for executing Socrates. It sounds like he was feared by the authorities for some reason. This strange man chose to accept his execution rather than deny his principles even though he could have probably avoided it.Taylor says that Plato viewed the doctrine of the forms as his unique contribution to philosophy. I did not gain an understanding of the forms from this book but it sounds like Aristotle's Metaphysics may provide this.I'm most interested in the more mysterious and esoteric aspects of Plato's life and writings. However those are the very things that were never well known about Plato even during his lifetime.According to the legends Plato traveled to Egypt and experienced the Egyptian initiation process at some level as had Pythagoras. During those experiences the initiates came into direct contact with the mythological gods.I have read also that Plato was criticized by the other initiates for allowing some of what he heard in Egypt to make it into his writings. The initiates were sworn to secrecy and this type of information could become dangerous in the wrong hands. Perhaps The Parmenides contains some of those metaphysical secrets.Taylor provides one of the stupider interpretations of Plato's misunderstood and often contradicted Atlantis story. Taylor says Plato used the story to talk about events that happened during his own lifetime and Plato was telling history in reverse. This is an example of how someone like Taylor will try to answer mysterious questions by referring to main stream, orthodox academic sources.Even so it's hard to imagine how many books someone like Taylor must have read in his life.Taylor held Plato in very high esteem and considered Plato to be a literary genius but I'm not sure exactly why.Jeff MarzanoThe Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)Edgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of MosesFingerprints of the GodsAtlantisInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Giza Death Star Destroyed: The Ancient War For Future Science (Giza Death Star Trilogy)Mythic Troy: The Complete Story Legend Archeology and IntuitionOccult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (2nd Revised Edition)"},{"Title":"The Christian's great interest","review":"This is an incredible book! It's a shame so few people know about it. William Guthrie, a Scottish minister, published this, his only book in 1658. Some men only need to write one book in their entire lifetime. &quot;The Christian's Great Interest&quot; is one of those books. Although the reader will have to get used to some 17th-Century language and expressions, the book comes across as a generally easy read. Guthrie masterfully describes the characteristics of people who have a genuine interest in Christ. What is the evidence that a person knows Christ? Do you have doubts? What is the difference between true believers and pretenders? Guthrie answers these and many more questions. This is an essential book for all Christians."},{"Title":"The Christian's great interest","review":"When I read the Preface that John Owen highly recommended this book, I expected it to contain harsh words and scary warnings usually found in his texts, which are not necessarily bad. To my surprise, however, though there are indeed some warnings against hypocrisy and insincerity, Guthrie filled it with plenty of gracious biblical exhortations, pressing unbelievers urgently to consider their case and to \\"close with Christ\\", as well as for believers to \\"give diligence to make our calling and election sure\\". There is an extensive coverage on the evidence of saving faith, where the premise is that though faith alone justifies, justifying faith is never alone, which I thought is excellent for self-examination. Contrary to today's common popular mechanical sinner's prayer as some sort of magic words for a quick conversion, Guthrie also brought up an interesting topic of \`express covenanting' whereby believers renew from time to time, their solemn \`viva voce' confession of faith and their earnest resolution to cleave to Christ to the end. I found the arguments presented to support such a practice compelling, where from Scriptures Guthrie claimed God commands it along with some examples as in Thomas' confession of faith after seeing the resurrected Christ, and David's death bed resolution in 2 Sam 23:5, despite many of his shortcomings, to hope in God's faithfulness through the covenant he made with him wherein lies all his salvation and desire. Guthrie even goes as far as to say not to practice \`express covenanting' could be dangerous, considering it is implicitly done regularly during the celebration of the Lord's Supper as well. This is a serious book on the most serious and the most important business in life, that is, to determine for oneself, a saving interest in Christ, as well as how to attain it."},{"Title":"The Christian's great interest","review":"How do we know whether we have a special saving interest in Jesus Christ and how can we obtain it if we find that we don't? These are the two questions William Guthrie concerns himself with in the book, \\"The Christian's Great Interest.\\" This book is a classic work on assurance of salvation and evangelism by a seventeenth century Presbyterian author.To Guthrie, how we answer the question about our salvation is of the greatest interest to all people. It is \\"not a vain thing because it is your life\\", and it is \\"the one thing needful.\\" Our salvation is discernable if we examine our case from the scripture. \\"To the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to his word, it is because there is no truth in them.\\" The bible commands us \\"examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own self\\", \\"give diligence to make your calling and election sure.\\"The first mark of our salvation is the experience of a preparatory work of the Law. Receiving the Spirit \\"unto bondage\\" Ro 8:15. Although many do not experience this, as those called from the womb or from early childhood (John the Baptist, Timothy) or in a \\"sovereign gospel\\" way (as Zaccheus) or on their death bed (as the theif on the cross), most people are brought low through sight of the Law, \\"when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died\\". The Holy Spirit awakens their conscience and they see they are compased about by innumerable iniquities. Jesus by his Spirit brings them through an intense internal process to make them \\"dead to the law\\" and without \\"confidence in the flesh\\" in order that they may see they are lost, sick and in need of a Physician.The second mark is faith. Faith is the grand and only condition of the covenant of grace and the instrument of salvation. \\"It is of faith that it might be by grace.\\" Therefore it is evident that he who can discover his own faith is saved. Guthrie explains that faith is not a difficult thing even though it is the \\"gift of God.\\" It is not believing that you are elect or that Christ died for you or any other proposition but it is simply the hearts satisfaction with God's plan of salvation through Jesus Christ. Scripture describes the acts of faith variously as receiving, staying, believing on, desiring, thirsting, looking on, waiting and other actions that indicate faith is not primarily an act of the understanding but of the heart and the will.The third mark is a renewed state. \\"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.\\" Guthrie outlines the evidences of those who are new creatures. The man must be renewed in his understanding, believing and trusting in the truths of scripture. His affections must be renewed, he must have a \\"new heart\\" and he must love God and His Law. He must \\"yield his members servants to righteousness unto holiness.\\" In his interests, worship, outward calling, and relations he must all be renewed. He must do all to the glory of God, \\"whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do.\\"Guthrie then takes some space to contrast the attainments of hypocrites with the children of God and to address some other difficulties. Hypocrites, he says, may advance very far in religion without a true interest in Christ. They may have the \\"form\\" of godliness, they may \\"taste\\" the truth, they may even be to some extent \\"enlightened by the Holy Ghost\\" but they never choose Jesus as their soul's one satisfying choice nor are they content to make him their savior but all their outward holiness is of some base motive. He then alieves the doubts of those who fear they are excluded from the Kingdom of God because of the power of their prevailing sin. He points out to them that David confessed to God, \\"iniquities against me do prevail but as for our transgressions thou shalt surely purge them away\\" and that Paul could say he served \\"the law of sin\\" with his \\"flesh\\" but despite their sins they still delighted in the Law of God after the inward man. Next, Guthrie shows that the sensible internal operations of the Holy Spirit are the special gift of God but are not the substance of the new man.In the second part of the book Guthrie leads those who have failed the trial of a saving interest to close with Christ. He begins this section by going through the basic tenets of Christianity. The covenant of works has failed by Adam's sin but God has graciously restored communion with man by providing a sacrifice for sin in his Son Jesus. God covenants with all those who submit themselves and their children to his ordinances and he requires them to seek salvation in Christ. Unfortunately, many in the covenant do not transact with God thusly but they flatter him with their lips, \\"They are not all Israel which are of Israel.\\" This is the case with most in the Church, \\"strait is the gate and narrow is the way.\\" For none can do it except they are made willing and able in the day of his power, being effectually called by the Holy Spirit.To accept the offer of the gospel is to set aside the covenant of works, renounce self-righteousness and to choose Christ as a precious treasure sufficient for the salvation of sinners. It is the command of all those who hear the gospel to do so and none will be saved except those that do. \\"Ho everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat.\\" He must take to heart that the wrath of God abides on him for the very sins he is guilty of and that his only escape is through Jesus Christ, who, if he comes to him, will in no wise cast him out for, \\"all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven of men.\\"To motivate unbelievers to so close with Christ Guthrie discloses to us some native effects of saving faith. Namely, union and communion with God. Through Jesus we have oness with God who is afflicted with our affliction and who is \\"touched with the feeling of our infirmities.\\" Through Jesus we belong to God and he belongs to us and we can share intimacy with him through prayer.Next, Guthrie succors poor sinners too afraid to acquiese to Christ with sweet promises and examples from scripture. He shows us how the saints of the bible were guilty of the most heinous sins under the most aggravating circumstances yet still found pardon. He assures us that God will forgive any one and any sin and encourages us that he will be pleased with those that come to Jesus because this is the means he has himself appointed to save sinners.The last chapter of the book Guthrie enjoins us to make an explicit verbal covenant with God. After the pattern of many men in the bible he recommends simply expressing in words before God what is the substance of the covenant of grace. This cannot save us if we do not have a heart work (contra the Arminian invitation system) and is not necessary to salvation if we do but it will help clear up for us what our state is with God. Guthrie then gives a very thurough example of such a verbal covenant and he recommends not just taking it once but renewing it on special occasions such as after backsliding or before the Lord's Supper.Finally, Guthrie concludes with a catechism summarizing the whole book. In the Banner of Truth Paper Back ed. there are also excerpts from some of Guthrie's sermons."},{"Title":"The Christian's great interest","review":"Do I really believe? Can I really know? These are questions that every Christian must ask themselves, again and again. Certainty of our salvation is not just a nice thing to have, it is commanded. Peter tells Christians to make our calling and election sure. This is the entire purpose of Guthrie's book.This book is not for the casual reader. Guthrie labors hard to show the believer, and the unbeliever, his true state, and I suspect he expected the same type of intense labor from the reader. Like many puritan writers, Guthrie's style is foreign to us today. He writes logically and completely exhausts his subject. The effect of this is that it allows the reader full certainty of the point the author was actually trying to make and it gives readers conclusive arguments for that point. However, a secondary effect is that it requires the reader to study the work intently and to really examine the evidence and conclusions the author makes.This book is worth every bit of effort. Being sure of our salvation is not something to take lightly and an intense study of Guthrie's work will give the reader enormous insight into their own eternal condition."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"This book has been very useful as a reference for me personally and for the students that I teach.

No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"I expected more from this book based on the reviews that I read before buying it. Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"I have nearly ten anatomy books and this is the one I grab for most when I need to solve an anatomy problem while drawing or sketching.For the most part, Bridgman first simplifies complex anatomy problems into simple structures before exploring the muscle patterns into more complex detail. This allows the artist to see the particular anatomy problem as a proportional mass rather than a complex network of muscle fibers. For me, this makes the human anatomy much more accessible.For instance, he will take the torso and break it down into simple objects like cubes, triangles, and planes, illustrate them in their proper proportions, and then move forward into to more precise detail.I find this book not just educational but as a great reference as well."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"Mainly for intermediate-level artists- it's actually *GREAT* for enthusiastic beginners. It has a little bit of *everything* depicting anatomy construction from memory. It's also great for general improvement; a few tips & tricks- an *excellent* reference for all working artists.This is the book that really turned me on to the genius that is Bridgman. At first glance it may not be immediately impressive, but flip to page 167 for a quick look at his cubed-construction of the head. It's Bridgman's brief but effective treatment of cube-construction in this book that really, really impresses me. Many books *mention* cube-construction for heads; many books show a brief picture or two. But not many show it with the precision & detail that Bridgman conveys in just a few short pages. It deals with figure construction mainly in its parts- for full-figure movement, check out Bridgman's Complete Guide, or his less overwhelming Bridgman's Life Drawing. Constructive Anatomy begins with hands, which in my opinion is the weakest part of the book. (Bridgman's 100 Hands is much, much better.) Arms are next and they're easily among Bridgman's best, although not all the drawings are crystal clear. Many of the BEST drawings in Bridgman's Complete Guide are taken from this book, and his depiction of arms here is definitely among them. The shoulder & neck briefly follow, and are above average in their depiction. Then it's time for that excellent section: the cubed-construction of the head. It's only a FEW pages- I don't want to oversell it. But in my opinion at least, it's worth the price of the book. Individual features follow: eyes, nose, ears and mouth are simply & accurately treated. This is a more *in-depth* book than Heads, Features and Faces- which is mainly a simple introduction to the basics. Maybe the BEST section in Constructive Anatomy involves the Torso. He describes more in a few pages than most books ever do- and with a precision & beauty that few seem to match. The pelvis, legs, knees, feet & toes finish this truly excellent work. If anyone's overwhelmed by Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is a simple & effective choice to make- Highly Recommended!In short- Along with Book of a Hundred Hands and Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is currently in my Top 3 by Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"One of the few books that I constantly refer to in figure drawing. Although the content was written way back in 1920, the concepts are still as valid then, as now.The simple pencilled illustrations provide easy guidelines as to where one muscle stops and another begins. This enables one to draw a muscly figure with a few lines and shapes to show bulk and depth, especially with comic book illustration.Finally, the price is perhaps as great a drawing factor as the content. Some comic book artists swear by Geoge Bridgman's books. You might also want to try some publications by Jack Hamm."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"Lemme tell you something right now. This is one sweet little book! It gets two stars right off the bat because it's really cheap(unlike Hogarth). For a student who doesn't have an income, this really helps out. When I bought this this book, I thought I knew a little about human anatomy. Well, put it this way, I was wrong! This book is PACKED with anatomy! Thanks to it, I've been getting alot better. Now I'm starting to do a real study of this book, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"this book is by far the best on figure drawing that i've seen. bridgman is an absolute master of the human form, and he breaks everything down into simple shapes to help even the novice. his realistic and beautiful drawings are anatomically accurate, and quite nice to look at! buy any of bridgman's books, including the brilliant &quot;book of 100 hands&quot;, and you'll be treating yourself to an extremely inexpensive lesson from a true master."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"In fact, I can safely say that this really is the most important book on artistic anatomy one can learn from. Many seem put off at first glance (I know I was) and say one of or all of the following...1 - \\"the drawings look sketchy sometimes\\"2 - \\"the anatomy seems exaggerated\\"3 - \\"the look might \\"cramp\\" your style\\"4 - \\"will copying the drawings really teach me anatomy?\\"Well, after having gone through the book once, reading how others go through it, working on form & exercises, and since I'm going through it again, I'll address these points.----------1: The \\"sketchiness\\" isn't there for the sake of being rough. Those lines & curves are there to show the rhythm and flow of how this part leads into that part. Keep in mind that not every drawing in the book is like this.2: The anatomy isn't really exaggerated. Consider that Bridgman's approach is on how muscles wedge into one another. If you study form, can analyze it, and can combine verious forms with overlapping, and then look at the drawings, things will click. The forms of various muscles stand out to show how the wedging works and sometimes the muscles happen to look flexed, that's all.3: This was an odd comment I read at [...], and there's no way that going through this will \\"cramp your style.\\" If this is the first anatomy book you're considering, and if you've never gone through a drawing book at all, then you don't have a style. Don't worry about finding your style if you're just starting out - take the time to learn foundational principles & techniques, and make that your goal.4: I imagine that alot of people would think of copying like this: \\"Draw this line, put that curve right here, draw the line next to it, now move the pencil over here and draw this curve, repeat.\\" Don't do that. It wasn't until I had a better grasp on form & the \\"classical approach\\" when things began to click. Once you learn the fundamentals of rhythm & gesture, observing angles, form, and \\"sculpting in the paper,\\" use that understanding to analyze not only subjects for life drawing, but also drawings. As Glenn Vilppu says, \\"Don't copy the model, analyze it.\\"---With that said, this book will show you anatomy as a set of forms, how they look from different views & actions, and, overall, how everything fits together. It's the perfect book to pull out once you can draw those geometric skeletons. Take your time and understand the text as Bridgman will explain what you're looking at. Analyzing the drawings is one thing, but the text does mention a lot of aspects on how the anatomy works.There is one flaw in the book, and that is the layout. I found myself having to flip between a few pages to look at the right drawing with the appropriately labeled parts so I could flip back to the text and better understand the stuff. This got a little frustrating but if you're patient, you can pick up alot of things from this. Like I said, take your time."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him. I was very exited about this book, and as they say \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" I did,because the cover is so nice,in fact it is the only good thing about this book, the jacket. I thought the reprint was going to be awesome, like the Dover publication books. When I got it, the reproductions are super faded, can't read the script either, I suggest getting Bridgman books from Dover publications."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"As an art student, I've perused quite a few instructive anatomy books. I was suggested Bridgman by a teacher who ranked him as simply the best. A lot of the reviews here seem to focus on quality of reproduction, so I'm going to focus on the original product. By the way, get Dover.Pros:As stated universally. Bridgman runs through the all the major body masses ranging from something as large as the trunk, to something as minuscule as the septum of the nose.He shows the human form in various stages of muscular undress, ranging from skeletal to fully skinned. There are often numerous angles and perspectives from which to study as well, and proportions are helpfully laid out in block form for the larger masses.Speaking plainly, I haven't found a book that does better than what Constructive Anatomy does.Cons:Formatting is a little awkward. Text that pertains to a whole section appears on the first page of the section, and the following pages are wordless. This makes it mildly frustrating to follow the words of wisdom that Bridgman is no doubt divulging. Which brings me to another drawback.The vocabulary matches the book's age. Expect a great deal of Latin nouns. Despite having a pretty firm grasp on bone and muscle names, I found myself lost on numerous occasions. Consider the following text, describing the armpit:\\"Its rear wall is deeper, since the latissimus attaches farther down the back; thicker because made of two muscles (latissimus and teres major), and rounder because its fibres turn on themselves before attaching to the arm bone.\\"This would be an extremely minor annoyance if not for the complaint mentioned above. Much of the text is disassociated with the illustrations, forcing you to either flip back and forth, or try to follow along in your head.My final con is what irked me the most. There is no female anatomy to speak of, and neither does Bridgman speak of it. For an anatomy book, this is a severe drawback. I understand the age of the book may have made such depictions taboo, but we're talking about half the population here. Bridgman's men are patently bony. Not as a synonym for thin, as they are exceedingly thick, but his bones have a tendency to protrude and take the shape of geometric objects. This is of course very beneficial to students, and his drawings are pure joy to duplicate, but you can imagine how hard it is to transfer this knowledge to the neglected sex. Anatomy books have a tendency to prioritize subjects approximately in the following order: the Male figure, the Female figure, the effects of age and finally, the child. Bridgman focuses solely on the first of the queue.My conclusion is thus: Bridgman's Constructive Anatomy is an excellent manual for building men of young to middle age. The description applied to it most often seems to be \\"it's a great starter book.\\" I would contend that the male and female figures are so different as that one cannot \\"start\\" with a male figure, and end up with a female figure. Consequently, Constructive Anatomy is not a great starter book for understanding the female structure.Despite the cons I have stated, I have given the book 4/5 stars. Why? Because I knew of these drawbacks before I purchased the books, and purchased it anyway. The score is not some form of self-punishment for making a mistake, but a rating of the material I knew and wanted. I only list the cons so that future purchasers may know them as well, and make a more evaluative judgment."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"this book is a tragedy. great book, but publication quality is zero.don't buy a reprint.get the original."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy (Worthwhile how-to paperbacks)","review":"This still remains as one of the top anatomy books I use the most. I actually like the fact the figures and illustrations are not super detailed and more loose sketches. A beginner might find this frustrating, but as a person that is trying to develop my own style I find it more important you get a loose interpretation and fill in your own details and personal touch. Otherwise you'll just have clone artists of these anatomy books.The other reason I love this book is the price. It's small size makes it very easy to carry around too.I feel I've improved tenfold since I've purchased this book on making my anatomy look more real."},{"Title":"The Man Who Went to Heaven","review":"Nobody could have anticipated the recent events ever happening to our country.

Overall, I found this good vs. evil story a fun read."},{"Title":"African Eve","review":"African Eve, a first novel by Bill Ketcham, offers readers a brilliant, fresh plot, which encompasses not only a compelling and complex mystery, but also suggests an anthropological hypothesis in keeping with the theory of Natural Selection. With a truly imaginative theme, this book greatly deviates from the normal semblance of whodunit mysteries. It reminds one of the systematic approach of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels.Detective Charlie Lauts, of the Kansas City Police Station, has been following a trail of \\"Black Widow\\" murders where many of the victims seem to have met their end amid amorous settings. At each of the crime scenes, a symbol - etched in blood, has been discovered. Is this sign indicative of a cult? Or could it represent a truth that is far more significant?In desperation, the Police Dept. turns to the talents -albeit slim may they be, of \\"psychic consultant\\" Horace Spinney. (Unfortunately named after the Egyptian deity \\"Horus\\" - by his overly zealous parents.)Although rather acerbic in nature, Detective Lauts seems to be somewhat fond of Spinney and soon the two are evading groups similar to the KKK. Likewise, they are busy meeting with \\"The Bathwater Brethren\\" - a group of mostly retired professors as they seek to discern clues in their attempt to solve the puzzle (and murders)of \\"African Eve.\\"The addition of the Bathwater Brethren was just terrific and this group would be a great continuence for a future book.I believe that African Eve would especially appeal to readers who are interested in anthropology or those who are familiar with how the human brain works. Having a background in both, I had no problem following the premise of this book although the author does point out the connections in varying introductions for those who are not as familiar with such concepts.Afican Eve is a great read for anyone who enjoys a suspenseful mystery! Truly a significant first novel!"},{"Title":"The tragedy of Coriolanus (The Folger Library general reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Coriolanus does not want to seek votes just because he was wounded fighting for his country.

'The Best of Joy of Tech' may be worth the risk.Of course it's easy to enjoy a cartoon book by a pair of cartoonists that share your prejudices. It is obvious from the cartoons that Nitrozac and Snaggy are Macintosh loving, Linux leaning, Microsoft loathing geeks. Hmmm, sounds like me.Not that Nitrozac and Snaggy are totally one-eyed. They still have a dig at Apple and Macintosh owners along the way. Unlike quite a lot of cartoons about tech these two also see the more human side, just as likely to make a joke about your cat's relationship to you and the computer as poke fun at LARTing end-users or pointy-headed bosses. Their cartoons are more about living with technology than working with it.The book reproduces a couple of hundred of 'The Joy of Tech' cartoons from their website, in improved color and resolution. The website features a new cartoon every couple of days. There are also a small number that are original for the book and some funny marginalia in a couple of spots. It also has the matching JoyPoll and a short comment about the cartoon in a 'JoyWorld' section at the back of the book.I find a fairly large number of the cartoons repeatedly funny and most of the rest worth a chuckle. These two have a good eye for the whimsical, ironic and downright funny side to a wired in, geek life. They even manage to get in a sly reference to geek site Slashdot with a fake O'Reilly book, \\"Trolling In a Nutshell\\" with a troll wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \\"FIRST POST\\" on the cover and an Introduction by 'Anonymous Coward'.Oh, that reminds me. The book has a very Wozniak foreword by Steve himself and an introduction by David Pogue that is nowhere near as good as the book (I'm sorry David, but any self-respecting geek [male or female] would rather do almost anything than edit the Windows registry, starting with install a decent operating system and working all the way through to changing jobs, heck, I'd rather sleep with Jobs.)The book is broken up into various sections, each with a theme. It starts with \\"Boot-Up\\" and continues with \\"4nim4l cr4ck3rs\\" (most about cats), the whimsical \\"Geek Love\\", \\"Hacks and Cracks\\" (I loved the couple who want to get housing within 50 meters of a war-chalked wall), \\"Techie-daze\\", \\"How about them *nix\\" (featuring the luscious 'Linux Lass'), \\"The Joy of Mac\\", \\"Who do you want to poke fun at today?\\" (You'll enjoy the 'Stress Relief Dartboard'), \\"Sci-Fi The Comic Frontier\\" and \\"Do You think I'm Xexy\\" before finishing with \\"The World According to Geek\\" (with 'The Lord of The Root - One Geek To Rule Them All', the two good looking woman who don't shy away from maths and the Barbie 'DotCom Rescue' CD-ROM game)If you go to Joy Of Tech you can grab a copy from the authors that has been signed (you even get a chance to ask for a custom inscription) and for an extra fee Nitrozac will even bless your book and attach a lucky sticker. You could go to the O'Reilly page, but since they don't have example cartoons and I don't imagine a cartoon book will ever have errata there isn't much point.It's not easy to review a cartoon book. Suffice to say that I found the 'toons in this book to be a good variety from amusing through to funny with some that are just a little too true to make me do more than groan.

It does picture the beginnings of modernization in old Tahiti, while hearkening back to earlier times when the only way to Papeete was by boat. A keen insight into the reactions of the Polynesians to the modern world and the beginnings of a hybrid culture that moved from gratis open-sensuality to tourist profiteering, with some rousing tales of an assortment of adventure-seeking free-spirits who sought their own unsullied Eden. The reader is left with the impression that it might have been better if the jets had never arrived and the French had never come--then again--who can keep the handsome beauty of Tahiti from the rest of the world. And for a person that grew up watching Adam Troy in Adventures in Paradise--well, those days are gone forever."},{"Title":"The Science and Wonders of the Atmosphere","review":"I really don't understand why introductory meteorology textbooks, especially one of this caliber, have an extremely short shelf life. Gedzelman's &quot;Science and Wonders of the Atmosphere&quot; was published around 1980 and stuck it out for about four years before withering into the annals of &quot;out of print&quot; status. However, the author has written a masterpiece, boldly exploring different facets of operational meteorology, weather and the arts, and human impact in a very lighthearted, succinct style. This book is so &quot;user friendly&quot; that it allowed me to master thermodynamic diagrams and hydrostatic fundamentals when I was only 13 years old! The physics and forecasting aspects are still as fresh in 2003 as in 1980. However the book suffers from storm forecasting theory that appears to be rooted in the 1940s and 1950s, drawing mainly on the works of Byers and older Fujita material, and of course it was published too early to benefit from the impact that America's next-generation radar network brought just ten years later. Still, this is an exceptional work of art, and the vivid illustrations will satisfy even the most challenged science reader. For those who enjoy meteorology texts but are not satisfied by the current crop of books, finding a used copy of Science and Wonders of the Atmosphere will be sure to please."},{"Title":"The Science and Wonders of the Atmosphere","review":"Beautiful book. Illustrations and data selections add unique insight to the clear descriptions given. We still refer to several of them in our online classes, and encourage students to find a used copy... which happily I see are still available.

Sources of wx data are now outdated, but the basic knowledge in it is not.

I like the way Hannah's characters explore motherhood from different perspectives. The protagonist, Angela DeSaria Malone, 38 is newly divorced and traumatized. After several miscarriages and a daughter who dies shortly after her birth as well as a failed adoption attempt, Angela's depressions after these tragic losses sadly rang the death knell in her marriage. Her husband, Conor Malone felt that their marriage had been tabled because of Angela's deep depressions. As with so many of Hannah's characters who actually do travel, Angela returns to her small hometown of West End in Washington State. Most of Hannah's characters are like Evergreen State boomerangs - once thrown out into the world for travel and other reasons, sooner or later they return to Washington State to regroup and repair relationships. This book is no exception.Angie's co-protagonist is Lauren Ribido, a high school senior who has a perfect academic track record. She is the class of 2004 and aiming for a scholarship to USC. A brilliant student, she secures a scholarship to the prestigious Catholic prep school, Fircrest Academy. She lives in a very bad part of town with a single mother who, at 34 reminds her almost daily that having her [Lauren] was a mistake. Lauren's mother is Lauren's opposite number. She smokes, drinks, picks men up in bars and takes drugs. Their landlord, a kindly woman named Mrs. Mauk often lets them slide on the rent due to Lauren's ambitious drive to get out of the dingy apartment building and to start a new life.Lauren does indeed get blessed with a new life. Her rich boyfriend of 4 years, David, fathers their child. David is rich and is eyeing top colleges. Lauren is eyeing a possible scholarship. Prior to becoming pregnant, Lauren left fliers around town seeking work. Enter Angie, who eventually hires Lauren to work in the DeSaria family restauant. There, as is expected, Lauren shines.She and Angie bond, Lauren becoming and not unexpectedly so like a daughter to Angie. Angie fights like a soldier for her and even butts heads with some rather formidable challenges on Lauren's behalf.The DeSaria family are a delightful cast of characters, from the DeSaria sisters' mother, Maria, who is also a formidable character. She still confers with her late husband, called Papa. Papa adored Angie and favored Angie, much to her two older sisters' dismay.Angie has to repair her relationship with her two older sisters, left in tatters after she left West End to attend college in California and start a life far removed from the restaurant. She has to swallow her pride and face the music in her small hometown. One's heart goes out to Angie when she winces at the \\"kid talk\\" from her sisters and brothers-in-law. Angie's losses are like a shroud she wears until she meets Lauren.Despite Angie's good intentions to Lauren, including taking her in after the girl's own mother abandons her for becoming pregnant, questions arise. Is Angie doing the right thing? Will Lauren keep her baby? And will David stay in the picture? Will she disappoint Angie as another young mother did when she stayed at Angie's home?Love and motherhood, the ultimate love is the hub on which this story turns. Each character is richly drawn and is quite plausible. While complex on many levels, the conclusion seemed rather predictable. Even so, it's well worth reading.10cc's 1977 song \\"The Things We Do For Love,\\" which I never liked could easily underscore this book."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"To start off I am an avid reader who likes many different kinds of books and likes a variety of different authors. I just started reading this book two days ago and I couldn't put it down. I think that the message that Kristin has in this book is a very important one. I wish in many ways that I would have read this in high school.Although most of the book centers around the two main character's Angie and Lauren I liked how she intertwined the meaning of family within in the novel. Growing up being very close to my sisters it was nice to see the bond that Kristen created with the three sisters.Not wanting to give much away about the book I would say it encompasses three main values in my opinion: Family, forgiveness, and friendship.

The story is a good one, typical Kristin Hannah.....a bit of a tear jerker but hard to putown."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Just finished this on my Kindle, Great book! I loved the characters and how the story is told through both Angela and Lauren's eyes. It was a heartbreaking and heartwarming novel all at the same time, amazing. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"For years Angela DeSaria Malone has felt one things has been missing from her marriage, a child. The desire for the child grows so strong it destroys the marriage. Heartbroken, Angela moves back to her hometown to be enfolded in the arms of her loud, lively, Italian family. On the other side of town lives Lauren Ribido, a teenager, with a mother that cares more for her next drink than her daughter. In this book we find that life may bring our greatest wishes in a different package than we expect."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I had enjoyed the first book that I read by this author (Magic Hour: A Novel), but I thought that was mostly due to the subject matter (feral children). This book shared similarities in that it too was about families and children. And also that the family was so unrealistic.Still, it was an enjoyable and certainly escapist-fast read. I will most likely read more by her - though I doubt I will ever pay full price.In many ways, this author is reminiscent of Jodi Picoult - though on a more superficial, beach-read type of level.Still, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sappy, sentimental-type book."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I recently picked this book up from my local library. I liked it but I did not love it. It is a good read but I felt that the book was predictable. I pitied the young teen-aged girl character, Lauren Ribido. Sigh. The ending was expected (the predictability of it all) but disappointing just the same."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I love Kristin Hannah books so I am always excited to pick a new one up and read right through it. Good things - if you family is far then you will definitely long for them (asuming you would rather be near them). Shows the power of love. This book is slightly heart wrenching, but I cry easily. Bad things - the story of the book did not happen in the order it made it seem like on the cover. Typical Hannah. The jacket says that Angie and Lauren would go through this big thing and I was hoping it wouldn't be the cliche (I don't want to totally give it away, but you can get the clues from the jacket). I was hoping they would go through something like a robbery together. The story was still good though."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is gentle and wonderful story that make you really feel a part of the charecters lives and really fell like you know them.Makes you appreciate the things we take for granted like a functional family, nice house etc..."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The story starts off a little slow but then I was captivated by the characters and the outcome. Very Good book"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"My first experience with Kristin Hannah was great! If you loved, \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" you will love the family in this book.Angela DeSaria Malone befriends Lauren Ribido whose selfish and toxic mother abandons her. Lauren experiences the stark contrast between the large family craziness and Lauren's home life as she struggles to achieve her academic goals and learns that she can determine her own fate.Laruen's unexpected pregnancy takes her on a path where she faces her fears, her past, and discovers herself, truth, and true friendship. Angela also is taken down the path of healing her past and facing her flaws and fears.Great book, but have the tissue nearby. I will definately recommend this author."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and I will have to thank her. It was a great fast, easy read and a wonderful heart-warming story. I don't usually go for this kind of reading but I must admit that I couldn't put this one down. I actually read it in one and half days. I would highly recommend this but really just to women, I don't think a man would be interested."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Angie DeSario has found the bottom of the barrel - from the loss of her daughter, the loss of her father and divorce from her husband of 14 years, she's determined to find some peace in her life and returns home to the small town where her mother and sisters, a lot of memories and much needed healing await.Lauren Ribido is a teenage girl who can only count the love of her boyfriend as a blessing. When life unexpectedly throws twist after twist at Lauren, her mother abandons her and Angie seems to be the shining example of a mother she never had, these two women will help each other, hurt each other and most of all, become the family each of them has longed for all their lives.The story is heart-wrenching, with emotional viewpoints from both Angie and Lauren. This is the first novel of Kristin Hannah's that I've read, it definitely won't be the last. I could not put this story down, these two women, one young and with life full ahead and one not-so-old, but wise and saddened beyond her years, touched my heart. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've always been a fan of Kristin Hannah's books, but this one is the best by far.

I'm recommending it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I don't know how Kristin wrote this story without crying her eyes out the whole time. But then, maybe she did. This has to be one of the sweetest stories I've read in a long time, heartbreaking in more ways than one, but the end results will warm your heart. They say most fiction writers base a lot of their story content on real life circumstances, and I know this can be true. Still, you wonder how one mother can be so heartless to her own daughter, while another woman can come along to pick up the pieces, and feel blessed just being able to do so. My hat is off to Kristin on this one, she's written a remarkable novel. And she's right...The Things We Do For Love...are too numerous to mention.I can't wait for Kristin's next novel. I totally recommend this book to anyone for their reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am a huge fan of Kristin Hannah and once again, she has produced a winner. i could not put this book down - in fact, I read the final 200 pages in one sitting!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have been a fan of Kristin Hannahs since she wrote On Mystic Lake but I must admit that her latest project is her best book to date.

The predictability didn't bother me so much as the ending. Yes I was happy that Angie & Con got back together. I knew David & Lauren didn't have a chance, but for Lauren to keep the baby and not take the scholarship??? STUPID! If she'd let Angie and Con adopt the baby they'd all be one big happy family and that's what I wanted.Loved the depiction of Italian family life. I am not Italian but grew up in a very Italian area and the DeSaria family seemed very realistic to me.I would definitely read more of Kristin Hannah's books."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Such a heart wrenching loving read.

Both women are swept up in life altering experiences.Another listen that requires Kleenex on the side.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I was looking for something to read on vacation and what a wonderful surprise! I was so pleased with this book that I am back today to buy at least 3 or 4 more by this author.

This one is one of the best of hers I have read. The story showed very strong emotions, very realistic situations, and highly believable characters. This book looks some things straight in the eye, like poverty and teenage pregnancy, making the reader want to help those that are suffering from either. The story will make you believe in the power of family and the power of love, and it will more than likely make you shed a few tears.

It's been awhile since I've been able to do something like this!This is probably my first Kristin Hannah book ~~ and I was leery of picking it up since I am on a roll with my nonfiction reading.

She had given up her dreams of having a baby after suffering for years with miscarriages, infertility issues and losing her little baby, Sophia. She comes home to where her family is and rediscovers her dreams. Lauren, the other main character in the story, is a loveless seventeen year old, who has worked very hard in maintaining a scholarship at the local private school. She works full time after school and is dating the star of the football team, David. Lauren and Angie discover one another and helped each other to heal.It is a beautiful story ~~ lots of promises and hope and joy.

I plan on reading another one of this author's books if I see them around!5-30-06"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was a great story all about reaching out to others. In this book, Angie, who was newly divorced and lonely, comes back home to help run the family business, the Desaria Restaurant. After getting divorced from her husband Conlan, she needed something else in her life. And what better than helping the failing family restaurant with new plans?As Angie turns the restaurant around, a new girl comes into her life, Lauren, a teenager whose mother is an alcoholic who just lays around all day. Lauren has such a longing to be wanted and loved by someone, and is really trying to make something out of herself. When Angie meets this girl at the Help Your Neighbor shelters, she takes to her.

Intense, quick reading--holds your attention. Moves quickly, and you just think you can figure the ending--and the author switches on you! Plan to read other novels by this author. Story touches the heartstings!"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"What a beautiful story of love, loss and acceptance. This story personifies the age-old cry of injustice regarding people who want children and aren't able to have them, versus those that have them but don't want them or aren't able to take care of them. In a heartbreaking but spellbinding manner, Ms. Hannah expertly exposes the raw and ragged relationship between the young Lauren, with nothing but a bright and happy future ahead and her mother, whose life seems to be one of continual failures and disappointments. When Lauren seamlessly becomes part of a large and loving family through recently divorced Angie (who's desire to be a mother has left her emotionally spent), they each fulfill a critical need in the other, that is nothing short of heart-wrenching. I laughed, I cried, I didn't want it to end. I know it's a good book that I've just finished when I spend the next 2 days thinking through what would have happened next--had there been another chapter. I appreciate the writing style of Ms. Hannah and very much look forward to the next book of hers that I read. (I have two unread in the book case--ready to dive in!)"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I enjoyed this novel, which explores the concept of motherhood in many different forms. First there is Angie, who wanted to be a mother so badly that it ruined her marriage. She undergoes several unsuccessful rounds of IVF, she pins her hopes on adopting a baby from a pregnant teenage mother who later changes her mind, and she experiences the heartbreak of giving birth to a premature baby, who later dies. All of this occurs before the novel begins; by the time we meet Angie, her marriage is falling apart and she's getting ready for a divorce.Second there is Lauren, whose mother is an alcoholic who takes little interest in her. Lauren lives in a dilapidated apartment but is determined to break out of the lower class by working hard at school. Then she becomes pregnant and all of her plans are called into question.Third there is Maria, who is Angie's mother. Maria is a rock, the Italian mother of three adult girls. Maria has a minor role in the story, but her presence is still important; she is the head of a big, noisy family, the kind of family Lauren has always dreamed of and Angie has always taken for granted.When Lauren and Angie meet, it seems they are both able to give each other some semblance of what they've always dreamed about. Angie immediately adopts the role of a mother, taking Lauren in when Lauren's real mother finally abandons her. Lauren, in turn, is made to feel a part of Angie's big Italian family. But the real challenge to their relationship comes when Lauren announces her pregnancy. Angie is suddenly confronted with envy towards the girl she's come to think of as a daughter. And Lauren isn't sure she wants to keep the baby. When she offers it to Angie, Angie isn't sure she wants to accept--can she go through heartbreak again if Lauren changes her mind?Ultimately, the question of what it means to be a mother is the central theme of this book. The different relationships between the characters are explored in detail, and those relationships become more and more complex as the story reaches its unpredictable conclusion. Anyone who is interested in the subject of motherhood will find this novel to be an enjoyable and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Angie experiences so much loss in her family and searches for peace.

Such a wonderful and poignant story that shows the true meaning of love and family. I have become a avid fan of Kristin Hannah after this one. *****K. Blair"},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book starts out great and is a wonderful story for about 95% of the book. And then, it takes a dramatic turn that is both outrageous and nonsensical, not to mention totally inconsistent with the character we learn to love throughout the book. The end is a profound betrayal to the characters and the reader, that turns what could have been a beautiful story into a taudry tale of selfishness, betrayal and poor judgment. I don't get it. Kristen is usually so good at understanding how a character's actions affect the other characters in the book. Not this time. This story ends on a sickeningly sweet whitewashing of a heartrendingly stupid mistake. I ended the book hurt and deeply disappointed."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Having suffered multiple miscarriages, infertility, and failed adoptions, I could really relate to this character. I could not put it down. The thoughts and feelings were so real, I don't know how she could know those things. It was a bit cathartic for me to read, to know that someone understood and put into words the heart wrenching and bitter emotions of losing so many chances at motherhood. It was very realistic and believable, from my point of view."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"After reading all the wonderful reviews of this book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, I was bored the whole time. I'm happy to see other reviewers who were wondering what the big deal was with this book. This was almost as bad as a Danielle Steel book.

I just finished reading this novel and I have to say I couldn't put it down! I'm not an avid reader, so this book surprised me! The way Hannah writes constantly made me imagine I was right there in the scene of the book. I bought this book only to have read the back cover, never heard of Hannah, and to my surprise I am not disappointed. I would have never guessed the ending to play out like it did.

I can not praise the author enough. She excels in creating an emotional journey through her characters that you won't easily forget. She delves deeply into her characters psyches and delineates every nuance of feeling that is felt. The things we do for love is a touching story about the feelings and emotions of every day people. She captures you and takes you into the hearts and lives of her characters with such conviction. The element of mystery woven throughout the story keeps you on the edge wondering what will occur next. I could feel every emotion that was portrayed in detail. The karmic bond between Lauren and Angela from the very first meeting displayed the evidence of a strong soul connection. Destiny created the delicate balance between love and compassion as it brought all the characters together to share in a beautiful ending where all was complete. I don't want to share too much of the story and spoil the surprise for other readers so I will end with my favorite thought from the book. Page 280 shared that for once Lauren felt as if she was a part of things instead of on the outside looking in. A feeling of belonging is one of the best one can experience.

I don't do this often, but on this book I had to skip ahead and read a page towards the end just to make sure it ended the way I was hoping (it did!). If you are thinking about reading this book, do!

After reading her work, you wouldn't know that she started her career as a lawyer. During a difficult pregnancy she decided to pick up a project that her mom and she had started while her mom was ill. Her mom always knew her daughter was destined to be a writer, not a lawyer. Kristin's ability to portray realistic, well-rounded characters shines through again in The Things We Do for Love.Angela Desaria Malone lost her father, a newborn daughter and her husband (to divorce) all within a short period of time. After several failed attempts to have a child, Angela and her husband try the adoption route. Unfortunately, this too fails at the very last moment and proves to be a crushing blow to Angela. The grief of these losses has brought her life to a halt.Finally, unable to deal with her old life, she moves back to her family's cottage by the sea in West End, Washington, where she grew up. She hopes she will be able to figure out where her life should go from here. Mending a broken heart is not always easy but it's made even more difficult by her loud, but good-intentioned, Italian family who seem to show up on her doorstep whenever they think they are needed, whether Angela feels that way or not.

The characters were very believable & I really enjoyed reading about the DeSaria family, the chemistry between Con & Ange & the changes that the main characters went through & the strength they had. Wonderful book! I was sad to say good-bye to them when I came to the end of the book."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Perfect feel good story. Nothing schmaltzy or too heavy here. Just a good family drama, with warmth and humor while exploring the way we love each other at different ages and stages of life. The storyline involves a lovely Italian family set in the Seattle area. Of course there is food and affection with that set up but Angie has a broken heart and needs to heal. Will her family help her mend and ease the memory of an infant daughter who failed to thrive or will she trust her own instincts and reach out to another family? Through mistakes and unfortunate circumstances, situations we cannot control~just live through ~ Krising Hannah once again moves us with her words and lets us see that love finds a way every time."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Recently divorced Angela Malone leaves her glamorous and fast-paced life as an advertising executive in Seattle for the peace and calm of her childhood home. Her marriage ended because she and her husband, Conlan, had been unable to conceive a child, and the constant stress that this brought upon their marriage was more than either of them could handle.Angie returns home to the arms of her large Italian family in West End.

End of story was somewhat unrealistic; however, the author did a good job of building the story and then I felt like I was left hanging and expected a better closure."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The Things We Do For Love is another tearjerker written by Kristin Hannah. Angela and Conlan have been married 14 years. Their marriage dissolves under the disappointment of miscarriages and the death of their one week old daughter. Angela returns to her seafront home where she meets teenager Lauren whose bitter alcoholic mother doesn't care if Lauren lives or dies. Angela always believed a baby and baby alone would fulfill her but after getting to know and love impoverished and desolate Lauren, Angela begins to see the truth: you can love a child no matter what their age and be a mother to that child. This book also accurately portrays what happens to so many teenage mothers. The girl's life is drastically and permanently altered (sometimes for the worse) and the father of the child is, for the most part, unaffected. This is a sad novel so you'll need to keep the tissue handy. The characters are all likable so it's easy to care about them. The ending is sweet and poignant. I definitely recommend The Things We Do For Love."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. There wasn't much of a climax to it, just kinda kept going on and on. A bit predictable as well. Of course the teen living with her would get pregnant, it's kind of a given in a book like this.

Lauren was born to a teenage mother, who the readers will learn to hate after a while. Lauren is completely on her own, and then the unspeakable happens with her boyfriend, who is a doll. I can't tell you about Angie without completely giving up the plot. All in all this book really tugs at your heartstrings, as both main characters are broken individuals when the book starts out. The plot was a bit predicatable, but if you don't mind that you shouldn't mind this book. I love Kristin Hannah, and The Things We Do For Love doesn't disappoint. Highly Recommended! The title is very fitting to the story too, which is unusual."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have never read any of Kristin Hannah's books before, but now I'm hooked. \\"The Things We Do For Love,\\" is an incredibly insightful treatment of many relationships: among them, the relationship between a potential adoptive mother and a needy pregnant teenager; the relationship between a divorced couple who still love each other; and the relationship between a woman who moved away from home and returns to be with family. I cared about every character in this book especially the two women at the center of the plot, Angie and Lauren. Both women face their struggles with dignity and courage. I definitely shed some tears and am still thinking about the characters lives.

This Italian family with their cooking will get you hungry as well as involving you in their personal crises.

She had miscarriages and a baby died days later; ended in divorce. But, this was a chance for Angie to seek a new desire: to move out of her box and cater to someone else's needs. Her relationship with poor Lauren who finds herself pregnant is perfect. I love the fact that Angie's husband returns to her as well after she finds herself running mom's restaurant in need of financial and otherwise uplift. This is a suspenseful novel and well written. One doesn't know until the very end how Lauren will vote re giving up her baby since her wealthy boyfriend has his college footfall career to pursue. But, all characters are drawn sensitively and that's new too. Excellent."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is the first book I picked up by Kristin Hannah, and she is now one of my favorite authors. What intrigued me at first was the story's geographic region as I'm from Washington State, so I love reading stories about places I've personally been to and know about. Another thing is I have a lot of sisters... so that drew me in as well... But - that's what got me to purchase the book... it's not what got me to *Love* the book.Hannah is a superb writer that tells a wonderful story time and time again.

Lauren longs to know a mother's love.\\" Angela returns to her hometown of West Bend, 120 miles from Seattle to help her father reopen his restaurant. Colin, the journalist, drives her there in his BMW intno the Pacific Northwest.In fact, he is deserting her to a fate she didn't forsee. Not having been able to produce a baby, which they had so wanted for a long time, he is 'leaving' her. As she adapted to this change in circumstances, she finds a young pregnant girl, Lauren, there and decides that by taking her in and adopting the baby, she will have at last received a bit of her dream, albeit it without Conlan.\\"She got in the car, heading north on Driftwood and found Lauren with red and swollen eyes at the bus stop.\\" She changed what would have been her child's room into an oasis for Lauren. \\"The leftovers of her marriage were all here.\\" She reminises as her life took a sharp right hand turn. Conlan comes on a visit and sees the baby things; \\"I brought everything to the cottage for Lauren.\\" She'd entered into a Faustian bargan and it would take them all on a terrible journey; at the end of it, broken hearts would be on the side of the road.Her lost dreams may at last come true, but at what expense. This story is written with compassion and conviction. I wish I could have found an Angie in 1975 and I might have had my 'little girl' to help me in my older years. The boys won't.For sensitive women, no matter what age, the things they will do for love of a particular man is beyond description. She needed a baby to get her life back in gear with the man she loved. Lauren had an alcoholic mother and a boyfriend who had insisted on abortion. Once you have had one, you will be forever guilty of killing someone you might have loved.Adoptive families like Angie's and Lauren's can find plenty of practical information in books, magazines, and on the Web. Charles Dickens wrote about Little Em'ly who was adopted in DAVID COPPERFIELD. Barbara Kinsolver, Jacquelyn Mitchard, Joanna Trollope, Gretchen Moran Laskas, and William Kowalski have written novels about adoption of unwanted chidren. The author, Kristin Hannah, is married and has a son -- but, like me, she must have always wanted a daughter.

She'd carefully crafted a life to help her reach the lofty goals of a good job, love, marriage and children. In that order. When life steps in with other plans, Lauren has to make decisions that could have repercussions for the rest of her life.Angie Malone is struggling to find her way back to love, family and peace of heart after a series of life's difficulties. Returning home to her widowed mother and sisters may save her, or break her.These two women need each other in ways they'd never imagined.

I was looking for a book and came across this on my Amazon account and thought I would give it a try. What a wonderful choice. It was one of those books that you feel sad when it is over as the characters are so well developed that you become immersed in the storyline. In the end, you feel like you are walking away from \\"friends\\" instead of just ending a good book.I always enjoy books that have some kinds of happy messages that are relatable and take you to a place in your heart that life sometimes scars. It is a beautiful story of love and family.Although the storyline is a little too perfect, it is nice to sometimes read about bad events that end in a happy outcome.I very much recommend this book for someone who is looking for an easy enjoyable read that will leave you feeling good."},{"Title":"Things We Do for Love, The (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Hannah is a wonderful writer.

The last book I had read by Kristen Hannah (On Mystic Lake) had been a disapointment so I wasn't sure I wanted to bother, but my daughter had purchased it so I thought I would give her another try and I was pleasantly suprised. The book was a good length and easy to read. I really liked the characters and enjoyed the interaction between the noisy Italian family members. I thought the character of Angie was well developed and the auther did a good job of descibing the sometimes overwhelming emotions of grief and how the pain can change you, sometimes for the better as in Angie's case. Overall, Lauren was also a good character. I would like to have seen a little more depth to her, but appreciated how she changed her life despite the odds against it.That said, I was a little disappointed in the ending. I thought it was a bit of a compromise to keep both sides of the argument happy, but left me a little deflated.Overall, it was it was a good book and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Destroyers Escorts of World War Two: Warship's Data Special (The Floating Drydock)","review":"It might be an old book, but it has some good information and photos of DEs.

Quimby and Donald Collier 1947) by accident in a used book store (sorry!), and was fascinated by the authors' descriptions of pre-Columbian metallurgy...in the \\"New-World.\\"Although one notes the use of words no longer applied in scientific circles the details the authors present are fascinating, e.g.:p. 40 \\"An aboriginal copper mine was a shallow trench which was dug into the side of a hill with the floor at the entrance or beginning of the cut low enough to provide natural drainage. ...rarely more than twenty four feet deep and two hundred feet long...\\"p. 42 and the suggestions what seem to be canoe paddles were used for digging and that the copper could have come from as far away as Cuba, suggests a quite different view of trading and Caribbean contacts in the Americas before Columbus (who noted this in his voyages of discovery).pp. 42-46 The descriptions of the manufacture of copper objects such as their purity, their hardening, working and other processing are most interesting reading, even almost sixty years after publication.It seems that in the books description at Amazon.com mention of co-authors George L. Quimby and Donald Collier has been omitted.Given the date of publication, it was found necessary to do some background searches.

Rozelle has clear instructions and simple line illustrations for making modules which can be combined in many different ways. Most of the modules are made from a single standardized paper square size, although in some cases the square size is modified by quartering or blintzing. There's also a \\"Complex Base\\" that's made with larger squares. (If you can get a supply of ~3.5\\" paper memo squares, those are a great size to start with; they're also conveniently proportioned for cutting your own blintz-sized 2.5\\" squares or larger 5\\" \\"up-blintzed\\" squares, if I can make up my own jargon on the spot. 3\\" mini-squares of origami paper are also a good starting size.)There are only a few fundamental module categories, but it's wonderful to see how many variations Rozelle comes up with. \\"Bases\\" are square face panels that can be modified in various decorative ways, including some that pop them up into three-sided pyramids. \\"Hinges\\" are simple blintzed quarter-squares that smoothly join two Bases along one polyhedral edge. \\"Clips\\" are more elaborate edge connectors that join two Bases with a projecting starpoint. \\"Joiners\\" connect three or more Bases around polyhedral vertices. Bases, Clips, and Joiners all have multiple variations and can be further embellished by adding contrast-color \\"Inserts\\" (usually a simple quarter-square tucked inside). All of these can be interconnected with simple folding techniques without recourse to glue; there are also instructions for incorporating string tassels and hanging loops into the folds.The simple line drawings seem perfectly suited to the Kindle transfer, but I have to admit that I'm feeling fiercely ambivalent about the e-book version. Technically, it has all of the same main content as the original hardcopy, but I'm finding it much harder to use. The Kindle version breaks up each folding pattern to one or two elementary steps per page, so it's much harder to browse through quickly. And in what I regard as a truly serious flaw, the Kindle version truncates the Table of Contents and chops off the \\"Units\\" list summarizing all of the module variations: 13 different Bases (about half of which are Complex Bases), 4 different Clips, and 10 different Joiners. I can't just add the \\"Units\\" list to my Kindle as a typed-in note, because the original hardcopy list is indexed by page and the e-book isn't paginated. The information is still in there; it's just harder to get to.So five stars all the way for the original hardcopy version; three stars for the Kindle version as it currently stands. I guess that kinda averages out to four stars."},{"Title":"Origami Ornaments: The Ultimate Kusudama Book","review":"Okay book if you wish to go with no glue, no staples etc. Feel overpriced in listed sources.

The plot synopsis given above is accurate so I won't repeat it here. The characterizations vary between 2D and 3D, with Gen. Duke James as the most fully realized member of the cast. Rizzi has done something quite unusual for this genre (one to which I am devoted despite my better judgment), which is even the odds between the armed forces of Good and Evil. Bad things happen to Good People and good things happen to Bad People. I am looking forward to the sequel (so many ends are left loose that there must be one in the offing) with eager anticipation."},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"Less engaging than \\"Jerry of the Islands\\" but a good read. A must for Irish Terrier owners.Caution, this is London's expose of the brutal training methods used by the trainers for the animal acts of the time. Half the book is descriptions of the typical abuses, some suffered by Michael, some by the animals around him.This was London's last book and he was sick, tired and depressed during this time of his life. It's not among his best but it is powerful stuff, as is all of London's writing."},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"I happened across this book while looking for stories about Irish Terriers. I wouldn't normally read Jack London; his stories always seemed more to my brother's liking. However, this book quickly grabbed me because a lot of it is written from the dog's perspective. And those passages are spot on. Michael reminded me so much of my own Irish Terrier and how he thinks and reasons. It really got to my heart. When I finished reading, I made a donation to the ASPCA. And although I don't know much about Jack London, I'd bet he had an Irish Terrier himself, for sure."},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"I first met these two dogs back in the 50's,as a child in what is now Czech Republic, in a Czech translation from the 20's. I read them innumerable times and remembered every word. But I had to wait for almost 40 years before I found the original, English, version. The dogs' intelligent and brave personalities shine through as before, despite what now would be considered &quot;politically incorrect&quot;, anachronistic attitudes.Thank you, Fredonia !"},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"This is a wonderful book, as is its prequel, Jerry of the Islands. It's a great dog story. But be warned, if a child is to read this book it should be under the guidance of an adult prepared to explain the extremely racist characters and situations. The story is no fluffy puppy story. It is exciting, the locations exotic, but some of the situations are brutal - it's a Jack London story after all, and the 'N' word appears at least a million times. Still, I'm not one for censorship, and it is a great opportunity to talk about just what happened to people of color, how they were treated, and why they might be justifiably angry about it."},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"JL was great at writing from the animal's point of view. you get the feeling he knew what he was talking about. there is no way you can read this book without feeling that the dog is a person, but also that this is a very realistic way of describing the dog's life. a dog gets kidnapped by a man, who turns out to be a rather nice fellow. adventure in this story, great dog psychology which always amazes me. i won't give away the dog's adventures but they are interesting, there is a lot of lovely details and particularly detailed descriptions of how the dog thinks, and the story is touching on a very human level."},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"Michael Brother of Jerry is an excellant sequel to Jerry of the Islands. Jack London sure knew how to write a book and make you feel as though you were actually in the story. These stories would be as popular today as then if not for a politically correct world we live in. Some of the statements made would not fit very well with todays race sensitive attitudes in this country. All that being said however it is a very good story and I highly recommend it if you like adventurous tales. Good book and the ending will leave you smiling."},{"Title":"Michael, brother of Jerry,","review":"This is London's expose of the training used for animal acts of the day, which starts in the Soth Pacific, using his South Seas experiences.

His father Tony is an actor with the National Theatre in London, England, and his step-mother is an American actress there, and with her own daughter aged nine. Tony inherits what appears to be an ugly pink stuccoed monstrosity of a house close to the Thames in the London suburb of Isleworth. But belying its early 19th Century appearance is the presence of a distinctly Elizabethan ghost. In the process of uncovering the mystery they uncover the real house and its earlier origins and a bit of family history into the bargain. The characters are very well drawn, and Roger in particular is a very complex young lad who grows and matures through the course of the story.I was and adult when I discovered this book at the time of its first printing, and was instantly captivated by the story and by its telling, and by the talent of the author. I have re-read this book a dozen times in the last 25 years and still enjoy it immensely. I cannot reccommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The \\"I Hate to Finish Sweaters\\" Guide to Finishing Sweaters","review":"After you read this \\"guide to finishing sweaters\\", you won't fear the final steps of producing a wonderful garment for yourself or gift giving.Easy to understand, and presented in a matter of fact way.You'll be so proud of yourself once you complete the last touches to that sweater.

It is not a HOW-TO book at all. It's nothing more than a listing of monster garage projects describing things they built. Most is a self-aggrandizement description of how great they are and the wild big stuff they built. Some don't even have a picture of the project.

The attempt to cover so many bases at once causes it to fall short in all of them. Being a Monster Garage publication one might reasonably expect it focus on custom cars, but it frequently digresses with such projects as a tool caddy and bizarrely, a log splitter. Further, if there was less emphasis on the stars of the custom car industry and more on the \\"how to\\" this would be a much better buy.

This is one book that you want to thumb through slowly as you take in the fantastic views of the incredible sights that humans and space probes have brought back to us since the dawning years of the space age.Space photography and imaging has given the human race a view of some of the most unimaginable wonders of our universe. We also see the miraculous images of humans and their fantastical machines in a realm long thought impossible to reach. This book beautifully documents all of the key milestones along our greatest journey. These images, taken together, capture one of the more hopeful and forward-looking pieces of the human story."},{"Title":"Space","review":"Andrew Chaikin is best known for his classic book \\"A Man on the Moon\\" which describes the Apollo missions to the moon and was basis for the equally classic HBO series \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\" In his latest offering, Andrew Chaikin presents the history of space exploration from the early space pioneers, through the space race, to the latest space shuttle missions to the International Space Station (ISS) using numerous high quality, large format photographs and a very small amount of introductory text for each chapter. I feel that this book will be another one of his classic space exploration books.The book opens with a small discussion of the early space pioneers such as Wernher von Braun, Sergei Korolev and Robert Goddard, and their efforts to develop workable rockets. The book then moves into the dawn of the space age and the race between Russia and the United States to achieve various \\"firsts.\\" For example, the first satellite, the first probe to the moon or another planet and of course the first country to put a man into space. After this portion of the book, the Mercury, Gemini, Vostok, Voskhod and early Apollo programs are examined. The next section is devoted to NASA's exploration of the moon and contains many full page photographs. To further emphasis the grandeur of these missions of exploration, there are several two page foldouts. The next chapter of the book covers the early robotic exploration of the solar system, up to and including the Viking and Voyager missions. The next portion of the book examines the space shuttle era. It is here that I feel that the book should have included more. While the space shuttle has been flying for over twenty years, there is less than twenty pages of shuttle related photographs. The book concludes with the current robotic exploration of the solar system, some really excellent photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope and the construction of the International Space Station.I only have two minor criticisms about the book. First, most of the photographs are devoted to the space race up to the Apollo moon landings, with very little dedicated to the Space Shuttle and International Space Station projects. Secondly, many of the photographs are ones that have been published before so there is very little new here. Nevertheless, these two very minor complaints, are overshadowed by the splendor of the numerous high quality photographs is this book."},{"Title":"Space","review":"This book is loaded with photographs as well as a historical narrative. What I found especially interesting was a series of photographs of the unsuccessful Soviet effort to beat the US to the moon in the late 1960's. These include the large new Soviet booster rocket that kept exploding shortly after launch, as well as a scaled-down (one man) Soviet lunar module that was never used. This information exposes the falsehood, advanced against the US Apollo Program at the time by certain left-wing circles, that posited that there had been no moon race because the Soviets ostensibly never had intended to land men on the moon. They certainly did--and they failed."},{"Title":"Space","review":"Andrew Chaikin's Space: A History Of Space Exploration In Photographs is a visual display gathering over 300 images which pay tribute to and trace the history of space exploration.

Here are the 8 books that I purchase from my most favorite to my least favorite along with my review.1. Airedale Terrier - A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog, by: Bardi McLennan. 155 Pages. Color Pictures.If you are going to own one Airedale Terrier book, the one ABOVE is the one to own. It is filled with information such as the History of the Airedale, Characteristics, Breed Standard, the Airedale Puppy, Proper Care, Training Tips, Health Care, and Showing. It filled with lots of color pictures and good information.Below are other options which I rate below my first option above.2. Airedale Terrier Today - Janet Huxley 174 Pages. Color Pictures.3. Airedale Terrier - Pet Owners Guide, by Janet Huxley. 80 Pages. Color Pictures. This is a condensed version of the books listed above. Still an overall great book.4. Airedale Terrier - A new Owner's Guide, Betty-Anne Stenmark. 158 Pages. Color Pictures.5. Airedale Terrier - An Owner's Companion, Mary Swash and Donald Millar. 168 Pages. Black and White. In addition to general Airedale information, this book also provides information on the Airedale Bloodline listing some of the top Champions and Airedale breeders.6. The New Airedale Terrier - Jun Dutcher and Janet Johnson Framke. 276 Pages. Black and White. In addition to general Airedale information, this book also provides information on the Airedale Bloodline listing some of the top Champions and Airedale breeders.7. Airedale Terrier - A complete Pet Owner's Manual. 93 Pages. Mainly Black and White.Not rated:Airedale Terriers (Pebble Books). This one is a children's book and has a dozen or so color pages.All in all, the information contained in these books are similar in nature. In my opinion, the ones rated towards the top are the most comprehensive.As a last note, I finally have my Airedale puppy and it was worth the wait. He's the best dog ever!"},{"Title":"Standard Handbook of Fastening and Joining","review":"This is a very ambitious undertaking and, understandably, the Third Edition is a hefty volume. Despite its size, it simply cannot and does not cover the entire diverse realm of fastening and joining. Nevertheless, the subjects selected for coverage are concisely illustrated with dimensions and tabular data and relevant standards are cited. This is a very useful handbook. I am pleased to have it on my shelf. There are some shortcomings.Most puzzling about this work is the criterion for inclusion or exclusion. Significant fastener categories of keen interest to a broad base of industry are missing, such as bearing mounting hardware, shaft collars, tapered adaptor bushings, pneumatic quick-action couplings, etc. On the other hand, other categories included, such as log (home) connections, can only appeal to a vary narrow specialized industrial base. Also, why is welding, a subject treated thoroughly in other dedicated works, allotted so much precious space here?If this handbook is truly intended to cover &quot;all&quot; fastening and joining systems, then far more space is required (probably multiple volumes). Otherwise, a more rational selection process needs to be implemented.I suggest prospective purchasers examine the table of contents, if not the full text, before buying, to be sure their areas of interest are adequately covered."},{"Title":"Up the Math Ladder: Activity Based Ideas for Teaching Math to Primary Grades","review":"Up the Math Ladder is an excellent book chalk full of refresing ideas to teach math concepts.

It is not \\"fluff\\" as the other reviewer thinks, it is a cleverly written source of information on how to select and care for and train a dog. This is told from the dog's point of view so that the dog is selecting and training the human. Dog and human behavior, like dog-dog and dog-human interactions, are described. If everyone's dog and human learned these things, the world would be a better place for all of us! How many times have you have someone's dog jump on you or go after your dog, not to mention humans in cities who don't pick up their dog's poos.

I got it working, but as far as getting it to really do what I wanted (something similar to NuMega DevPartner which can act on particular files in the project), this book didn't get me there. I'm not sure if the author has built any really useful add-ins either. There's certainly a market for a good book on it, but this isn't it. FWIW, I have the same author's book on programming Word, and I didn't find that any more useful than the online documentation, so perhaps this author just needs to get more into the material and then share what he learns. This book is probably too short, and perhaps the space to properly expound on the material was limited by the publisher."},{"Title":"Developing Visual Basic Add-ins","review":"With great excitement I purchased this book, when thumbing through it in the store it looked really promising. It truly does give alot more information than MS does, but it still leaves you confused a bit. The object models are shrugged off to very little commentary and figuring out the complexities of manipulating objects within a large program is not even touched. I had hoped that this topic had finally gotten serious consideration, it appears that this was only meant to be an intro book. I would highly recommend it if you only want to know what an add-in is, but if you want to do some serious programming with addins, you'll need alot more than this book."},{"Title":"Developing Visual Basic Add-ins","review":"I expected more from this book. The author notes (correctly) that the IDE Extensibility model is poorly documented by Microsoft. That's the reason that I bought this book, but it too fails in completely documenting the object model. After reading this book from cover to cover, I got the feeling that this book was thrown together quickly just to get it out. Some of it just seems like filler. For example, there's a chapter on Object Models. Those of us writing add-ins should know this by now. It was all VERY basic stuff. Many of his examples (expecially in the menus section) give examples that go against the MS Word menus. Why? We're writing this stuff for the VB IDE! Unfortunatly, this is about the only book I've found on writing add-ins. Maybe another one will surface soon."},{"Title":"Developing Visual Basic Add-ins","review":"Like others, I purchased this book because I was tired of screwing up my face at the pathetic Microsoft documentation.Dr. Roman's explanations and sample code got right to the heart of the matter.

Naturally, this lead me to believe that this book would be just as good. It wasn't.I try to suggest other books in my reviews, but there aren't many that cover this exact topic.

The tales included are broken down into 18 groups and are appropriately found under relevant section titles. The selection is mainly fables and fantastic tales concerning spirits and mythical creatures, but does include some more realistic stories as well. The only additional content is a brief Publisher's Note found before the table of contents. The overall accuracy of the translations appears exceptional, but is marred by minor spelling and grammar mistakes that could have easily been avoided by proper editing. However, the book is still recommended for any reader interested in Chinese history and/or culture, as it still manages to be interesting and allows the reader a fascinating view into the culture of China.In-Depth Review\`Selected Chinese Tales of the Han, Wei and Six Dynasties Periods' is a rich collection of Chinese folklore plagued by minor grammatical and spelling errors. The 90 stories included are divided into 18 sections titled: Tales of Marvels, Records of Spirits, Records of Strange Things, Accounts of Immortals, Records of Ghosts and Spirits, More Records of Spirits, Tales of Qi Xie, Records of Light and Dark, Records of Wonders, More Tales of Qi Xie, Accounts of Marvels, Divine Manifestations, Accounts of Avenging Spirits, Tales of Jealous Women, A Record of the Temples of Luoyang, Prince Dan's Revenge, Tales of Emperor Wu, and New Anecdotes of Social Talk. One surprising feature of the collection is the original Chinese version opposite the English translation (a technique similar to that seen in the Library of Chinese Classics series). Additionally, there is a brief Publisher's Note included before the table of contents.The actual tales reflect the deep history and strongly developed sense of mythology that was present during the times from which the stories are derived. Also present in the selection, which is thankfully expressed in the translators' English version, is the influence of the ideals of Confucianism along with other strong belief systems of the time, as seen in the various fables concerning the consequences of one's actions. Each story is well placed under a section title that adequately represents the topic; however, the book's weakness lies with the language used rather than the content depicted.Grammar and spelling in the English portion of the book are a major issue at several points, requiring the reader to attempt to discern the original meaning of that section of text on their own. Had the book undergone thorough editing, the text could have easily improved in the overall readability and word flow. Despite these problems, the translators do an excellent job of presenting the tales in a storyteller manner, not quite childish, but not overly complicated. The resulting work is one that mixes cultural elements of China with storytelling elements easily picked up by western readers.Xianyi and Yang have produced superb translations that retain the creativity and aura of the original Chinese tales. While the lack of proper editing has undoubtedly taken away from the book overall, the stories are still legible and contain interesting and valuable insight into the history of one of the world's longest lasting countries. All editing issues aside, the bilingual feature is a major plus and allows the reader to consult the original text if necessary. \`Selected Chinese Tales of the Han, Wei and Six Dynasties Periods' is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in China, human culture, or short stories in general, but readers looking for a long, continuous storyline should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mr. Modem's Internet Guide for Seniors","review":"If you or anyone you care about is reluctant or afraid to get connected to the Internet because it seems complicated and time-consuming or because you think you can't teach an old pup new tricks, you should get connected to &quot;Mr. Modem's Internet Guide for Seniors&quot; first.

However, despite that and that it is generally a little weak overall, the book is absolutely indispensible as a reference guide to everything from maps, to nanos, to clusters, to weapons and monsters.

In addition, this is probably the most informative book about what it is \`really like' to be a member of the SAS than any other I have ever read. No, this is not a book about what life was like in Hereford when her husband was away doing whatever SAS soldiers do whenever they are away from home. Far from it. In many ways this is an honest biography of an SAS soldier seen through the eyes of his wife.Though never SAS trained, I did serve with the regiment in the early seventies and am very proud of the fact that I passed \`Selection' in order to do so. I was 21 at the time and (A) was yet to taste marriage and (B) was yet to serve in Northern Ireland. For those and many (many!) more reasons, they were halcyon days where I learned much about people and much more about being a soldier. Over the following 20 years, however, I spent over 7 years on duty in Northern Ireland prior to two wretched tours in duty in the former Yugoslavia and am, therefore quite able to identify with some of the problems revealed by this work.From the very beginning you will be left wondering whether or not this lady's (and she is some LADY!) story is about the eventual death of her husband in the service of his country. It is certainly all about the ups and downs of their life - and the downs are most tragic. We also find curious insights into the practise of SAS soldiers when one of their number is killed.Whilst many people think that soldiers who return from serious conflicts in foreign lands are able to leave those wars behind, the mental effect on those at the forefront of the fighting remains with them forever and it is strangely comforting to know that such anguish is also felt by those who were the elite within the overall profession of armed warfare.Author Jenny Simpson is quite a Lady, I only wish all soldiers could find such a partner. I know, I tried 3 times and it was all too much for them. I wish her well. I would also suggest she tries writing another book because she has a natural talent.NM"},{"Title":"Biting the Bullet: Living with the SAS","review":"Behind the bravado and heroic derring-do of the Special Air Service lies another story, the one you have never read about in the spate of &quot;tell-all&quot; books about these bold British commandos that have surfaced in recent years. Jenny Simpson pens a heartfelt story of the families of SAS operators and the lives they lead, which are in some cases every bit as demanding as those of their gutsy men. These true stories of both the hardship and the immense psychological pressure endured by courageous women like Simpson bring a long overdue, more human face to the hyper-efficient &quot;Killing Machine&quot; persona that the SAS wears in pop culture. No library about the SAS would be complete without this volume, for it serves to give real depth and dimension to the SAS mythos. On the other hand, readers of macho spec-ops books like &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; would probably be turned off by this read, since it doesn't have much in the way of action, save when the SAS decides for a time to get spouses involved in firearms training and the &quot;Killing Rooms&quot;, which in itself is fascinating. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Biting the Bullet: Living with the SAS","review":"In the same genre as \\"Married to the SAS,\\" this book looks at the SAS from the wife's perspective. Quite an insightful and interesting account, particularly when compared to \\"Married to the SAS.\\" To Jenny Simpson and her husband's credit, their relationship does survive the SAS. She also offers a great deal of insight into the family pressures and strains that are caused having a husband in the SAS. Whilst also being somewhat critical of the \\"support mechanisms\\" that are in place for wives and families.The usual Brit class thing comes thru in the book too. There's the \\"officer's wives\\", with typically Brit upper/upper middle class attitudes, and the NCO/Troopies wives, usually Brit working class. For those who are not Brit but have worked with them, it's a real Brit problem that most of them really don't realize or see coz they've grown up with it and it's embedded in their psych.

It's a curious phenomenon to observe. Often, literary criticism takes the form or a balanced review of the pros and cons of this or that, embellished with a little flair of phrase. But, in the hands of a vapid opportunist, therein lies a chance at increasing one's own sales, and cutting down a senior literary figure is the golden goose. Take for example, Tibor Fischer's savage critique of Yellow Dog in which he broke an embargo so he could generate publicity for his own book, published on the same day as Amis's. Fischer's \`review' did not give so much as an inkling as to what his issues with the book were (he claims he couldn't because of the embargo, which one then leaves me to question Tibor's motive even more - why not wait a few days and put in an honest work?), but nonetheless became the \`scandal' to refer to (I think I scantly need to remind anyone about his jibe at it being bad in the \`masturbating uncle' kind of way), and hence set the tone for most of the published reviews. And gave him no end of free publicity. This is not to say Amis is much better in this regard, he was overly harsh on many writers in his earlier critiques, in particular Norman Mailer, which he has acknowledged in The War Against Cliche. But having read Yellow Dog, I don't fully understand the derision of it.Yellow Dog is a demonstration of Amis at his most playful, doing what he does best - writing menippean satire filled with picaresque characters. He invokes word play almost all the time. For example, the King of England sleeps with his concubine, He Zhizhen: \\"He touched him. He touched he. He was hard. He was soft. He touched him and he touched he.\\" But mere word play isn't enough for Amis. He crushes the entire concept of what a multi-plot line story should be structured like. Far from delicately interweaving the stories, he rigidly sets them apart in different sub-chapters, confounding the reader with a constant barrage of characters to keep track of, as though he intended to make Yellow Dog a challenge; to mess with the reader. But alas, the story comes together, subtly at first (are they going to come together?), and then with the anticipation and inevitability of a slow motion car crash.The central character of the book is Xan Meo: the renaissance man (man of many artistic talents) who is struck across the head in a violent attack, and suffers a brain injury. During his recovery he begins to lose himself, lose his language and manner; or perhaps becomes himself (a long repressed self) again. His wife, Russia, struggles to cope with this altered personality as Xan fights to remember who he is and why he was bashed. In a brilliant passage, the collapse of Xan occurs when he is interviewed and his language regresses from normal articulation to that of a common thug, with persistent swearing and crudeness. In my experience, devolution of the kind suffered by Xan isn't uncommon. An acquaintance I once had suffered a brain injury that changed him: made him intolerably short-tempered and aggressively critical of his children and wife. His marriage failed. The cruelty of the injury was that he knew he'd changed, but felt powerless to stop it. The brain is the person, and his person was changed.Parallel with Xan's story is the story of Clint Smoker, an unscrupulous journalist at the Morning Lark: a largely pornographic and celeb gossip daily paper. Clint is superbly drawn as a lonely, sexually dysfunctional creature with a questionable moral compass. To demonstrate what I mean, he tries to coax a wild, out of favour soccer player (Ainsley Car) to sleep with a model and have his wife Beryl walk in on him, so they have an argument within which he can slap her one on the chops and generate a bit of news. He is also tracked by Amis in his email relationship with a woman called K8. Parallel to this again is the story of King Henry of England, who pronounces his a's as e's (\\"my mind's a blenk\\") and attempts to keep secret a tape of his princess daughter in the nude and discover who has taken it.Amis' vivisection of the British tabloid industry surgically ratchets out its thorax and exposes the cancer within. The hilarity of the Morning Lark is that is isn't that far from the truth, making the satire evermore stinging. Indeed the various deliberations of the Morning Lark staff remind me of something Christopher Hitchens wrote about journalist tactics. Two journo's would go and visit a freshly widowed woman at her home; one to take her into the kitchen for a nice cup of tea, and the other to swipe a family photo from the mantel. Another memory is that from Edward Behr hearing a BBC crew during civil war in Congo ask \\"Anybody here been raped and speak English?\\"There are interesting little wisps of inspiration and recurrent themes that drift through into the backstories, such as King Henry's brother being assassinated with Lord Mountbatten, though Mountbatten isn't married. Or introducing us for the first time to the name Scheherazade, (an escort in Yellow Dog) which reappears in his most recent novel, The Pregnant Widow. In the subtext to this book, a comet potentially threatens life on earth, however, everyone is apathetic about it. This is a revisiting of Amis' earlier work (think London Fields and The Information) and represents something of new pastiche on the current state of society. Short interludes about CigAir flight 101 provide a further backdrop impending doom.In a rare moment where Amis isn't creating a parody of the real world, Smoker is interviewing Karla White, a pornography actress. In a discussion of the prevalence of male-female sodomy, something of a recollection: the words of this fictional discussion are almost word for word lifted from interviews Amis had with pornographer John Stagliano and various \`actors' and \`actresses' and published in an essay in the Guardian. Terribly, lines such as \\"I know a girl who goes to the Mature Video Awards with her parents. Her father came out brandishing her statuette for Best Anal\\" arise from real testimony of actresses Amis spoke to. Some subjects just don't need satire.How could one write about Amis without mentioning his prose. I find it difficult to avoid becoming a hagiographer when I consider him. Sentences like \\"after a while, marriage is a sibling relationship - marked by occasional, and rather regrettable, episodes of incest\\" leave me in marvel at his ability to find the dark, and then describe it in a way that brings tears of laughter to the eye. This is his talent, and his focus. But following a superb first half, the second half of Yellow Dog provides less of this, though there are still gems, like the criminal so crook \\"he'd have himself committing crimes even in his alibis.\\" The result is a very funny book that, despite the exquisite lines; the great imitations; the caricatures and their well-constructed verbalisations; is no masterpiece, but better than most give it credit for."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"First off, I am definitely a fan. There.This is just the sort of a book where a master writer is sitting in his study and twiddling his thumbs and his editor rings and says, \\"Hey, I need something. You got anything?\\" and the writer hops a few jigs and puts something down while listening to some over ripe trippy tunes lays a few pages down and suddenly says, now this! - this'll do just fine. Actually, no, it won't do. It won't do at all. It's fine if you are a bloke in a bar waitin' on some little bird to show up and she's about an hour late and the peanuts are out; it's fine for a ride on the train; it's not fine for most women. Note to male writer: most women do not want to see inside your bathroom. No matter how charming and assiduously color coordinated; no matter the raised royal crest on a bar of soap; nope, no way and no how. When are the male writers in the world going to wake up from their coffee stupor and realize that real live women are actually going to pick up their books and give them a look see? Maybe I am sounding sexist. Too bad. Ah well, I'm sure someone as talented and skilled as Mr. Amis won't be losing any winks over this damsel's hastily written book review. Not that this book is totally uninteresting; not that at all; the distressing part is that the storyline is interesting and stealthily succeeds in luring the reader into this seemingly innocent tale about a writer who becomes victim to a crime then there is this dabbling all over the place with the King's mess and the King's Love and this is where I just couldn't take it anymore, I wanted to, but I couldn't do it; I couldn't go on with it; if it were a board game I would have thrown my pieces to someone else and said, \\"You go, I'm out.\\" It reminded me of some of my lesser writings things I'd written that I wished I hadn't and I thought; ah, love, experience. Yes, maybe this one is a bit of an experience. There are pairings of vivid greatness mixed with moments of pure distaste, and I wondered, how can a writer who so mellifluously has the world as a hand tamed pigeon cooing on his shoulder and writes such achingly gorgeous sentences; also, couple such passages with pure drivel? I don't get it; and then again, I do get it. All too clearly. I'm sure the lads will be quite happy with this read. And the ladies? For this one at least, not so much."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Xan Meo--loving husband, devoted family man, minor celebrity--goes to the pub for the annual celebration of his sober reformation. A couple of quiet drinks, alone, with a few cigarettes, and then back home for another year of clean living. Instead of the usual programme, he receives a beating from two men he never saw before in his life. They say it's payback. But payback for what? That's what Xan is trying to figure out as he recuperates from his brain injury. Because he wants revenge and he wants it in the worst way. Because he's not the man he was before his injury. He's the man he was before *that*. And that man was the product of a very disturbing past.That's how Amis begins this novel which becomes, quite perplexingly, a rather dismally didactic meditation ((you might say lecture or harangue)) on male violence and the awful suffering its perpetuated on the female of the species, not to mention the civilization that was invented largely to protect women from the baser urges of man-not-so-kind. Because that's what's basically happening to Xan--he's forgotten how to live like a higher creature of reason; he's reverting to his caveman roots, as would we all, Amis implies, if given half the chance.Power--brute physical power manifested in violence--that's what a man can be depended upon to wield in order to compel everything weaker than him to submit--wife, sister, woman-in-the-street, and daughters. Yes, especially daughters. Every father, according to Amis, wants to have sexual relations with his daughter. Why? Because he's bigger. Because he can. Because he made her and she belongs to him. Even to 'protect' her in some perverse way. Incest abounds in *Yellow Dog,* it crisscrosses the novel like a net, holding the whole thing together. It's practically universal. So there it is--plain as black and white: men are bad, women are good. Can anyone possibly call Martin Amis a misogynist *now*?Well, true enough, Amis' so-called misogyny evaporates and what stands revealed is an entirely different sort of gynephobia. Amis is so clearly and abjectly afraid of living a life without women, so terrified that women may indeed be just as flawed and undependable as he's always portrayed them, that he's come round to making them total victims, their every seeming misdeed pardoned, mitigated by the abuse they've collectively suffered since the dawn of time in this testosterone poisoned world. By the end of *Yellow Dog* Amis sounds as shrill and hysterically one-sided as any blinkered feminist professor preaching a fairy-tale gynetopia to the already converted--the converted, which is to say, as always, those minus the ability to detect the vast spectrum of gradation between black and white. It's an embarrassing thirty pages, those last thirty pages of *Yellow Dog.* It's like watching a man apologizing for an indiscretion with a self-effacing theatricality and desperation that leaves you cringing, like a man begging...begging for what? For mommy's approval, ultimately. \\"Mommy, please be loving, kind, warm, wonderful. Don't be cruel anymore. Don't be mysterious. Don't leave me by myself. Mommy, I'll be good.\\" This book exposes something about Amis that was there behind the cynical, chest-thumping faade all along: the lost little runaway boy who now wants more than anything to go back home.For 300 pages, *Yellow Dog* is a brash, unforgiving, funny, thought-provoking novel delivered with the incisive brio and dazzling linguistic fireworks that make Amis one of the best, if not *the* best, artist of the English language wielding a pencil today. But like the crippled passenger jet that limps its way across the background sky of *Yellow Dog*, the novel rapidly loses altitude towards the end and not even as skilled a pilot as Amis can save it from its ignoble nose-dive. Amis lost his nerve, I think. Or just got plain exhausted. He's come down to earth with a crash. Mother Earth, where we all must go, humbled, in ruins.What do you give a novel that's a clear 5-stars for 300 pages and a 1-star disaster for the last fifty? Three stars, I'm sorry to say, only three, which is a sad thing, for a master of the English language. But in \\"Yellow Dog\\" the courageous old yeller has been tamed, it seems. He's wearing a collar, yoked to the backyard spike. He's not rabid anymore. He can't bite. They didn't have to shoot him, after all. He didn't go out with a bang, but a toothless whimper. R.I.P."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I am a fan of Martin Amis, and was greatly looking forward to this book, but _Yellow Dog_ is a disappointment.There are clever bits that charm. For example, I loved this bit: \\"the U Hotel belonged to a chain whose owner had earned 78 billion dollars for realising that w was the only non-monosyllable in the English alphabet. Scrapping the supposed abbreviation, which had human beings gabbling out nine syllables, and replacing it with three other syllables chosen at random...would save global businesstime half a decade per day...\\" (287). It's these kinds of observations about every day life that make Amis the clever writer he is._Yellow Dog_ as a whole is a mess, though, and not a terribly interesting mess. There is the main plot of Xan Meo, who sustained a head injury in an episode of male violence. There is the story of Clint Smoker, the dismally endowed writer for a smutty tabloid, and his internet flirtation with someone who turns out not to be exactly like what she says she is (shocking, I know!) There is a sub-plot about a fictitious British royal family facing a scandal, which was kind of fun, but also rather simplistic. There is a porn industry sub-plot, in which it turns out that the porn industry has as much jargon as any other field. (That was kind of funny.) Then there is a sub-plot having to do with an airplane in distress that is entirely unconnected to the rest of the novel and somewhat derivative of Don DeLillo's _White Noise_ which did nothing for me.Here are the biggest problems with the book, as I see it:1) Sometimes it feels like Amis is trying really, really hard to be shocking and unpleasant. The effort is too visible, and yes, it is unpleasant and improbable to read about a woman deliberately trying to lure a man to commit incest with his 4-year-old. I understand that Amis is engaged in caricature (I loved Nicola Six in _London Fields_, the vampy, overdrawn femme fatale), but Karla White in this novel doesn't work.2) The structure is annoying: new sub-plots are still being introduced more than halfway through the novel, the airline plot is just THERE, as if Amis had it lying around and thought \\"Hey! I'll toss it into this novel!\\"3) The satiric targets are too obvious.4) There are no characters who really capture the imagination the way the best Martin Amis novels do: no lowlife, darts-and-porn-obsessed Keith Talent, no idealistic and naive Guy Clinch, no loserish, envious Richard Tull, no smarmy and self-satisfied Gwyn Barry.5) Almost everyone in the book, to one degree or another, talks like an Oxford graduate. Why?Martin Amis is a great novelist, but this novel fails to deliver. If this is your first time reading Amis, I recommend you try _London Fields_, _The Information_, or _Time's Arrow_ instead."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I just read an old Beatles interview where the Beatles themselves said when they weren't sure of a song's appeal, they would throw in a lot chords, figuring they'd dazzle the listener with the chord changes, while hiding the questionable tune itself. I had that feeling about this book, that when Amis is telling the sections of the story that are founded on a solid narrative, he writes straight and lucidly. When the narrative isn't of such sure footing, he tries to dazzle and distract the reader with oblique, recherch&eacute; word play. I prefer clarity and a good story."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I'm a full on Amis worshipper, but this book might be my least favorite . There are the usual language theatrics, and that's not to diminish them; when Amis gets a head of steam there's nobody writing in English who can run with him. Still, for the first time ever reading an Amis book I hurried through the ending just to get it over with.The book could just as well be subtitled \\"Martin Does Porn\\" because all of the story lines are in some way about prurient interest. Three of the characters spend at least some time actively in the porn business, while the pornography of violence and internet salaciousness are all over the place. Of course there are insightful moments and great humor, the descriptions from the point of view of a recently brain injured Xan Meo are fabulous and the autobiography of English gangster Joseph Andrews is a collection of numbingly repetitive violence and imprisonment that somehow manages to be incredibly funny at the same time.Still, the character Amis seems to inhabit the best is Clint Smoker, writer for a London based tabloid named the Morning Lark. Amis geeks will remember the Lark from London Fields, where darts obsessed Keith Talent (one of the more brilliant characters in recent literature) kept a copy tucked under his arm for most of the book. In Smoker Amis comes closest to his great characters. Smoker is sexually insecure, socially awkward, wordy, and disturbing, and Amis seems most at ease and in best form while shuttling him about. He also saves some of his most exquisite writing for Smoker; the Lark op-ed about the princess Victoria losing her virginity (it's hinted to her father) is twisted brilliance.Still, the various story lines never quite coalesce, and the book concludes with \\"family values\\" message that seems almost trite considering all of the blood and sex that leads to it. Yellow Dog isn't a bad book, but Amis made the mistake of setting the bar so high for himself. From nearly any other novelist this book would be a breakthrough, but from Amis it's quite average. Read it if you've already read everything else, but if you're getting to know him try London Fields of The Information first and read Yellow Dog when it's in paperback."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Even at his worst, Martin Amis outshines 95% of his contemporaries. This book had me at times laughing out loud, amazed by the wordplay and clever wit, transfixed by the plot, and touched by the understanding of humanity.There are passages to be read and re-read; quoted to a friend or contemplated in solitude. There are uncomfortable truths revealed, as Amis refuses to turn a blind eye towards human nature, however ugly it may be.For those who complain that Yellow Dog is &quot;too confusing,&quot; I suggest re-reading those passages which take you off your mark. I admittedly did this several times, and the pay-off for slowly re-reading a potentially non-linear thought pattern proved infinitely more rewarding than sluffing through the typical banality filling most fiction shelves today.For those who critize Yellow Dog as being &quot;too clever,&quot; I can only say that I prefer intelligent clever writing to the boring alternative. Too clever? That's a bit like complaining your dinner was &quot;too delicious.&quot;If you believe in surrounding yourself with people who are more intelligent than you may be (as I certainly do), you will love spending a few days with Mr. Amis and his Yellow Dog."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Martin is the master, and he's spot-on with his indictment of what passes for culture today. The seemingly disparate plots intertwine beautifully and surprisingly, and his mastery of the language is something to behold."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Do you ever feel like you cannot escape someone trying to sell you unwanted pornography, sexual aids, &quot;dating services&quot;, information about &quot;celebrities&quot; and ridiculous ideas for your married life? Do you ever feel like those around you are posing to make themselves more pretentious? If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of these dimensions, you will appreciate Martin Amis' latest book, Yellow Dog. Like a dog who cannot escape a coupling with another dog, Mr. Amis sees our society as caught in a trap involving sexual relations of our own making . . . that is ruining our lives.In Yellow Dog, he devises several interrelated stories to convey his harsh criticism of what passes for our &quot;common culture&quot; today. One involves a former actor, Xan Meo, turned writer who is brain-damaged by thugs when a criminal is offended by what Meo has written. In another, a fictional king of England struggles with illicit photographs of his daughter that should not be seen in public. A sex-obsessed &quot;journalist&quot; creates the type of tabloid stories and photographs that sell, but won't uplift literacy while dealing with an empty personal life. The remains of a loved one create a special type of havoc in the air while the Earth braces for a hoped-for &quot;near-miss&quot; with a comet.In the middle of these stories, the characters find that their pursuit of what others want for them leads them away from their own fundamentally good natures. Edgy humor develops as they confront their temptations and inner-most desires. Give in to those temptations and bad things can indeed happen to good people.The temptations are developed in pretty raw ways, involving such seldom discussed topics as incest, perverse sexual relations, excessive exhibitionism, and abusive uses of power. If you are easily offended in these subject areas, look for a different book to read.The stories remind me of the sort of satire that Voltaire used in Candide. The situations are overdrawn deliberately to rub your face in the point Mr. Amis wants to make. I found them redeeming in one quality, though. He describes a sort of synchronicity that seems to suggest that nature will take its course and eventually clean out the muck in our lives . . . as long as we don't deliberately drown ourselves in the muck first.Several parts of the book are very funny, especially the on-line exploits of Clint Smoker, the tabloid &quot;journalist&quot; and the ironic last trip of Royce Traynor. Several parts are sad, as men struggle to do the right thing with their wives and daughters.I graded the book down primarily because I didn't find myself relating very directly to any of the characters except the king and his daughter. The rest just seemed like comic book characters to me.After you read this book, I suggest that you read something tranquil and spiritual . . . to help remove the muck from your life."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I wait for Amis' books like I would the Second Coming, and I'm usually not left wanting. Unfortunately this was not my experience with YELLOW DOG. I felt at times he was trying to emulate Burroughs' cut-and-paste technique with the plot, but I didn't empathize enough with the characters to want to go back and retrace my steps. Yes, there's some diamond-sharp prose in this book, but it doesn't hang together. Where's the brilliance of LONDON FIELDS? The belly laughs of THE INFORMATION? Sorry, Martin, but you lost me on this one."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Martin Amis has pretty much succeeded in his aim to be considered the coolest, sharpest, wittiest writer of rough comedy in Britain. His reputation is probably the greatest of any current writer in the UK and his books are anticipated with slavering anticipation by the literati. In fact, Amis is so successful, he has created a large number of enemies along the way. 'Yellow Dog' was savaged in the pre review stage by Tibor Fischer, who wrote that reading it was like catching your uncle masturbating in the schoolyard. That it may be - this novel probes even more deeply into the slimy underbelly of contemporary Britain than even Amis is accustomed to. But this doesn't make it bad. Paedophilia, pornography, the gutter press, ruthless intrusions on the life of the Royal Family, gangland rogues, brutal bodily harmings, air disasters. All of this adds up to quintessential Amis territory, and some passages of Yellow Dog are so sharply on the satirical money that the world he invokes is like an eerily familiar parallel universe to ours - it is not Britain as we know it, but it might easily be.The plot is patchy, but Amis generally doesn't go in for plots. Like most of his novels, it appears as if he sets out a string of different shaped hooks on which to hang his multitudinous wordplay and punning skills - most particularly in the txt mssage style communications between failed tabloid hack Clint Smoker and a girl called k8 - an obvious trick for novelists to copy but this is the first time I have come across it.The novel is not one of Amis's best, but it succeeds because it so sharply evokes the nasty themes which underly so much of our contemporary culture in Britain. It is this feature of the book which makes for it's uneasy, sordid readability. It highlights what sort of people we potentially might be if the civilized veneer of our society was stripped away. This makes for unsettling reading, which is perhaps why so many members of the popular press slaughtered the novel so vitriolically. None of us likes it when someone points out our faults, and portrays them better than we know them ourselves."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I brought a novel to read on a recent trip, Yellow Dog by Martin Amis. I have to admit I was a bit leery about whether I'd like it or not, since I haven't been impressed with any of his fiction since London Fields (Time's Arrow structurally was interesting, but he holocaust has been so overdone really/ The Information-in terminal and really not all that engaging, a bit of navel gazing novel since it's bout two writers/ Night Train-dreadful American pulp fiction, which shows that you should really stick to what you know). That being said, it is his best novel since London Fields. One of the main reasons I think he is successful with this novel is that he is satirizing the culture and the people that he knows so well: hard men, the royalty, and journalists. I think he has always maintained his masterly stylistic writing and here it is put to goods use, as it usually is with his non-fiction as well (see Experience for a recent example of why Amis is still a great writer). This is an ambitious novel, some of the themes, motifs, and satire includes: the dark side of the male (which is manifested in violence and incest), pornography, the amorality of tabloid journalism, royalty, hardmen/gangsters, father/daughter relationships, and family. I see a sort of similarity in how Amis develops the amoral journalist Clint Smoker to how he developed the lager lout Keith Talent in London Fields-each is the embodiment of all that is wrong with the male species. There are a few weak points to the novel, there is one story strand about a doomed airliner that seems completely superfluous as well as the potential apocalyptic comet that passes the earth without striking it, I guess he was looking for that apocalyptic edge that informed a lot of his mid 80s writing when the cold war was still on-however it seems unnecessary in this case. There are some disturbing sequences in this novel, but overall quite satisfying-it's good to see Amis back on top of his game as far as fiction goes."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"If I'd never read another Martin Amis book, I would have thought this book was absolutely amazing. I'm reviewing it in relation to all other novels and not all other Amis novels -- therefore, it deserves 5 stars. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it made me laugh, it was great. It was better than Night Train (read like a contractual obligation), and Time's Arrow (a clever conceit, but worth a book? really?) and Other People (I just don't get this one).

He goes to his assassin's house and we learn--almost ritually, obligatorily--that they're versions of the same person. Their syntax has been constructed carefully so that we can't tell--by the pronoun--which one of them is being referred to by the word 'he'. One shoots a gun but wounds himself. But the syntax proceeds as if the other has been wounded. It's a narrative strategy that I think of first in LOLITA where Quilty & Humbert meet and begin a ritual swap of pronouns: 'I rolled over him. He rolled over me. We rolled over us.' One of them--Eric--has been studying the yen. Which goes up & up. The other--the baht. Which gets smaller & smaller. And there seems to be that convergence point. And yet it seems to be a ritual of convergence or an obligation toward convergence more than a discovery. In other words, something seems preordained about this.\\"From LOLITA by Vladimir Nabokov: \\"We rolled all over the floor, in each other's arms, like two huge helpless children.

He touched He.\\""},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"This novel's multi-layered plot defies the short summary. At the most fundamental level Yellow Dog is about the descent and subsequent return of Xan Meo, the novel's central character. The proximate cause of his fall from grace is a violent blow to the head intentionally inflicted as an act of revent in response to an inadvertent revelation in Xan's book, Lucozade. Xan's descent is evolutionary: from modern husband/father to a lower rung on the evolutionary societal ladder (but one tied to his past). This is a world, alas, not entirely foreign to today's readers. Still it is a long way from paradise. Here, for Xan, and manny of the people he encounters, incest tempts, tempers erupt and ordinary cognitive capabilities seem out of reach. We are cruising the primitive backwaters here -- petty, violent thugs, porn stars (a remarkably likeable lot in these pages), voyeurs and extortionists. Yellow Dog can at times seem frustratingly disorganized; yet Amis pulls the puzzle pieces together by the novel's end. Readers would do well to pay attention to the opening pages -- indeed the opening passage of this novel; it will begin to surface again, albeit in reversed form as Xan begins to regain his footing. In fact, the appearance of a plot in disarray is entirely deceptive. This novel is remarkably self-contained, including an explanation of its limitations: &quot;You don't think it's shocking anymore?...look at the future .. we're not frightened.&quot; Yellow Dog does assume an audience capable of being &quot;shocked,&quot; of distinguishing normalcy from the moral void, right from wrong."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I am not quite sure if there is a plot in this novel. It is a preachy novel about pornography and journalism. Xan Meo is more like an idealogy than a three-dimensional character. There is a sense of superficial intelligensia. The novel meanders with Xan Meo's [complaining] practically about everything. Smoker the journalism is a much more interesting character, but then again, Amis has to inject his snobberish intellectulism -- philosophizing everything.What is this novel about? A waste of my [money]."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Martin Amis' Yellow Dog is essentially an unreadable, pretentious, and painful book. You'd have to be a masochist to go beyond page 23, and believe me, I tried but the sheer confusion and boredom brought quick sleep to my eyes. Amis wants to become this century's James Joyce what with supposed innovative use of verbs for nouns and adjectives for verbs. He attempts to play with language the way a child plays with the mud that has formed in front of his cottage after a day or two of rain, and then comes back to the clean kitchen. The sad effect is the same. Get real, dear Martin, for God's sake. I turned blue in the face trying to make head or tails out of this dog."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"I haven't got fifty pages into this book (honestly I can't say that I will finish it) and I feel like I have wasted so much time already that I wanted to come to Amazon and warn potential readers not to do the same. &quot;Incoherent&quot; doesn't even begin to describe this choppy, strung-out prose. One of these reviews mentions emmulating William Burroughs- newsflash: Burroughs was barely swallowable the first time around; to imitate him is to ensure that you will go down in literary history (if you're lucky) as the author whose major influence was William Burroughs. I read somewhere else on here that we readers should &quot;lighten up&quot;- that this is Martin Amis, so of course he is making a parody of modern novels. Another newsflash: the &quot;parody&quot; defense is a last, desperate resort and if Amis himself is using it, you know that he knows he messed up. If you are going to waste that much of your creative ability and precious time making a -parody- of something, you need to find a day job. Any point Amis was trying to make could've been made in a nice little article in a major periodical and he could've been paid for it what he should've been paid. _Torrents of Spring_ this books is not.

I was intrigued by the reviews I read, both equally praising and damning of it. Amis's latest is indeed a page turner...but that doesn't qualify it as a good book. In fact, this is one of the worst, most incoherent books I've read in a long time...if not ever. I'm not usually one to completely slam a book. I can usually find at least one constructive thing to say about it. I can't here.Yellow Dog is a real dog of a book. It reads more like an exercise in shock value than a novel. It barely kept me entertained the plane ride back (word of caution: not a good idea to read a book on a plane that features an extended airplane crash sequence, but what did I know?) Still, I did manage to read it straight through in one eight hour sitting.

And mostly the very beginning, I am still confused as to why Meo was attacked at all...we are supposed to believe it is because he used a man's name in print? A fictionous name that is the same as a violent man [with a relatively generic name] would track him down to strike him down?

Most of the modern novelists just don't get it. Martin does. He's post-PostModern, and of course &quot;Yellow Dog&quot; is a mess, because it's intended to be a parody of a novel. That's the whole point. Mr. Amis is famous for being famous Amis, and also for recurrent themes in his fiction, none of which he takes all that seriously. The silliness and unavailing nature of fame and wealth (&quot;Money,&quot; &quot;The Information&quot;), the meaningless of life (nearly the whole list), and humanity's disappearing illusions as intellectual discovery continues. The point is, there's very little left to write about; you shouldn't quite take it seriously, a grown man making up characters and putting them through their paces. So he indulges in style, for fun, as a jape, heaping opacity upon banalities, fooling around with Joycean obscurity (clearly a major influence) and Bellow-like platitudinous bellowing. He's funny as hell (the stuff about Smoker's life&quot;style&quot; [&quot;his bathroom was the only non-unbelievable room in the house;&quot; who else could write that?]), he writes like a dream, and you simply can't waste your time while you're reading him. He's the best there is, and has been for a long time. If you like neat and tidy plot structures, deadpan sincerity, and no loose ends, read someone else. If you want to have fun and laugh at the world, read Martin Amis.

The shockingly awful rags pretending to be newspapers. The random acts of violence and petty crime. The drunken, loutish behaviour that has become socially acceptable. The rampant misogamy. The ridiculous anachronism that is the Royal Family. Amis hits all the targets in YELLOW DOG. It's the UK at its worst and fiction at its best."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Yellow Dog is very much in the same savagely satirical mode of much of Martin Amis's work, for example Money. It is set in an alternate present-day England, with an importantly different royal house, the last three generations of which feature such controversially named kings as John II, Richard IV, and now Henry IX. Also, a minor plot point is that a comet is heading towards Earth, predicted to miss by only a few thousand miles.Yellow Dog interleaves several stories, all in the end revolving around pornography. The main character is Xan Meo, a \\"renaissance man\\": actor/writer/guitarist, but also the son of a gangster. Xan is nearing 50, and living a reformed life himself: he no longer drinks or smokes, he is a loving and faithful husband, and the loving father of two young daughters. He had previously been in a destructive marriage and had two sons, but after a far from amicable divorce he has changed his ways. But once a year, on the anniversary of his decision to quit, he heads to a pub and has a few drinks and a few cigarettes. But this time, at the pub, he is waylaid by representatives of a crimelord and beaten severely, apparently for \\"naming\\" their boss compromisingly, though Meo has no idea how or even who. But Meo's beating, and the subsequent brain damage, drastically affects his relationships with his wife and daughters, and also his careers, and he ends up thrown out of his house, with a former porn star turned producer trying to seduce him, and with a job acting (not as a \\"participant\\", though) in a porn movie.Another key thread follows a vile journalist named Clint Smoker, who works for perhaps the worst of the London tabloids, and who despite his monetary success is an abject and humiliating failure with women. He too ends up on the set of the porn film, though as a journalist researching a story. There is also a thread about the King of England, Henry IX, and a crisis involving a secret pornographic videotape of his popular 15 year old daughter, Victoria. Finally, we end up meeting the gangster who has ordered Xan Meo to be beat up, and we learn much of his personal history, and of his financial and personal involvement with the porn industry.(There is also a strange thread involving an airplane flying from England to the US carrying the coffin of a recently deceased, very rich, man, and also involving the threat of a crash -- I concede I never really figured out what Amis was after with this thread.)The novel is very entertaining, full of rather savage and often vulgar wordplay, some gaspingly horrid behaviour (especially on the part of the tabloid folks), and some pretty scary things too, especially the degradation of Xan's character. The plot is somewhat intricate, and resolved cleverly and funnily. There are some details about the porn industry that I'm not sure are actually true, but have a horrible ring of possible truth to them. Except for the airplane thread, which as I said I simply didn't get, I thought it worked very well -- a strong, savage novel, not a great work, nor Amis's best, but, I though, pretty darn good."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"As a reviewer from the continent, I am blissfully unaware of what has made Martin Amis(MA)such a controversial person in his homeland. The Economist, in a recent, rather positive review of MA's latest, The Pregnant Widow, found it opportune to remind its readers that Yellow Dog(YD) was a substandard novel. According to which standards? Whose standards? MA is not the world's greatest plotter of novels, but his characters are superlative and his language use astonishing.MA writes to sooth his many fears and obsessions, such as the Bomb, pollution, competition among males, fatherhood, flying, the resurgence of Russia, and the non-working working class in Britain. In earlier books MA invented some unforgettable creatures such as the baby then toddler-from-hell Marmaduke, and Keith Talent, a gross yob aspiring to immortality in the game of darts. In YD, MA returns to his obsession with tabloids, its writers, targets and readers.D's hero, Xan has become a model husband and father of two since his acrimonious divorce, also a public figure, active on TV and as an author. Once a year he visits a neighbourhood pub to celebrate his continued good behaviour with a few drinks. And out of nowhere he is accosted by two strangers and beaten up very badly. When he is released from hospital his personality is changed, perhaps forever...MA links Xan with an outrageous cast of characters to explain the attack: wife, ex-wife and children; a tabloid journalist obsessed with the size of his manhood and his mobile phone girlfriend; King Henry IX (\\"Henry England\\"), his Chinese girlfriend, his male personal secretary and his daughter Victoria, very blackmail-prone, and a rancorous crime boss/long stay guest of penitentiary institutions, a psychotic football star, to mention a few.The novel provides SMS-talk from another planet and previews to totally new sub-genres in filmed pornography. Depressed? Read this book. It makes you laugh. Translators of MA deserve pity, admiration and stipends on top of their normal rates.

He even invents his own language for the character k8 (Kate) which is witty after you figure it out.He enters the world of porn with terms like Blackeye, Cockout, Redface, Boxback, Yellow tongue, Facial - some explained, others left to our imagination. His descriptions are equally visceral; he describes a planeload of disembarking passengers as \\" the tube of canned sex emptied in relays of tits, pits and zits \\"Four of the five disparate story strands sort of came together in the end, while the fifth one about the crashing airliner, didn't connect at all, and I wondered why it was there - further proof of male superiority, even from the grave?My issue with this book was that everyone in it (except for baby Sophia) is a bad, twisted person and I am not sure if anyone was redeemed in the end - so why bother?And the writer demonstrated arrogance in starting his scenes anywhere he damned well cared, letting the reader hang on for dear life and try and fit all the pieces together. I dislike all this \\"work\\" when reading to be entertained, educated and enlightened.I guess, in writing this book, Amis displayed his virtuosity with words but severely limited our view on his empathy towards human character.Shane Joseph www.shanejoseph.com"},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"Juvenal called his book of satires a \`farrago', and the word fits Yellow Dog very well. It's satire, it's a farrago of many different themes and plots, and it's a very clever farrago because Martin Amis is a very clever little man.I shall say immediately that I didn't much care for the book, and I shall try to explain why. However I don't criticise either book or author for being clever, for instance in having so many threads to the narrative. Amis's skill and professionalism ensure that the variety of plots and threads combine very well. If any of us find it a bit of an effort to hold the thing together in our heads, that's our own look-out in my opinion. It is not the job or duty of any author to write down to any sort of common denominator. What would be an interesting essay or exam question for advanced Eng Lit students might be \`What is this book about?' \`Yellow Dog' is the title of a column by a downmarket tabloid journalist, but a yellow dog puts in an appearance right at the end in a more serious context. Various press summaries that I have seen select as some kind of central theme the personality change undergone by one character, but, really, who are they to say, and why should that be the main narrative? Why should it have priority over King Henry IX, for instance?I am not going to stick my head above the parapet and offer my own opinion about what the main plot is, perhaps because I have no clear opinion on the matter. However one definite common factor is the satirical observation that pervades the story. There are brilliant take-off's of Prince Charles, man-of-the-people journalism, footballers' statements, tough-guy criminals, text messaging, very likely of the pornography industry too, and probably indeed more types of people and types of culture are being mimicked than I have detected. What about north London intellectuals? What Russia (a female character) writes to her husband about father/daughter interactions definitely has a serious side to it, but I'd be surprised if there is not a bit of mockery of north London chatter there as well. It's all very clever, as I said, but it gets on my nerves after a while. Imagine if you will some smartyboots type of guy who specialises in taking everyone off. He quickly becomes a bore, and often a downright objectionable bore. I loved a lot of the detail and I certainly admired the acuteness of much of it, but I soon got enough of it.The press clippings adorning my edition are nothing if not fulsome. One feature that comes in for considerable acclaim is the humour \`Extravagantly funny...' \`As funny as Dead Babies...' \`...devastating comic gift'. We are not devastated, we fear. In fact I laughed at precisely three things in the whole 140 pages of the novel, and two of those are not of Amis's authorship. Certainly he had a good instinct when he chose to tell us that Henry VIII had a Groom of the Stool to attend his bowel movements, and I had to go along with the derision at the sentiment \`Flowers are God smiling at us' when uttered by the monstrous gangsters the Kray twins. Full marks to the author himself for choosing the name He (pron \`Her') for a Chinese erstwhile mistress of the King. Otherwise I found the humour about as funny as dead Gazans or dead Zimbabweans for the most part.It must be quite clear that all this is a purely personal reaction of my own, and I do not wish to pass it off as objective criticism or evaluation. If asked what I liked most about the story I would pick out the strong element of fantasy, and I am quite prepared to rate that as more important than the narcissistic smartness that I found wearisome. Where I see that others have found fault with the book, namely in its complexity, I will come to the author's defence, and indeed I have already done so at the start of this notice. What I have tried to do, as fairly as I can, is to convey something of the flavour of the book. Not my own favourite flavour, but no reason why it should not be yours."},{"Title":"YELLOW DOG.","review":"1.

And thus how convenient it was to illustrate k8 by saying that she looked like Shelley. It's ludicrously out of character for Clint to be on familiar terms with Percy Shelley in the first place.

This book holds your attention, right from the beginning, and I definitely recommend it...In fact I recommend any book with Stephanie Laurens listed on the cover !! ^2-thumbs up^"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I love the way stephanie laurens writes. She is so talented at making you feel as though you are the main character. You hold your breath with they do and feel the love that they feel. I can see her characters in my mind and the scenery as I read. I have read plenty of romance novels. I don't read them because they are great literary masterpieces. I read them because they are entertaining and a wonderful way to wind down. Stephanie Laurens novels just seem to be one step above the average romance. Her characters remain true to form and their are no unexplained surprises thrown in or pieces just added to \\"fill space.\\" This story of a strong female determined to be independent, but learning that being in love doesn't make you weak is truly a captivating novel. Two very strong, independent people meet and fall in love while helping out those less fortunate. Her characters are wild, care free, and generous. You can easily read the novel because you don't hate the lead characters. They don't do things out of the ordinary or outlandishly absurd. Her love scenes are discriptive without being x-rated. They are sensual and inspiring. Her adventure storyline keeps the novel moving. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I adored this book. Stephanie Laurens is one of the very best romance writers out there and this book was a joy to read. She is at the top of my list and I have read MANY books. Be sure to read all the Bar Cynster series, too. Nothing she has ever written has been a disappointment. The sensuality and character development is just right."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Spies, danger, family, romance and affairs of the heart. Captain Jack's woman is funny, romantic and intriguing. Stephanie Laurens never disappoints."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I adore this series!! Stephanie Laurens is a master at the Alpha Rake!! I love the men pursuing their ladies!!What a great story! I laughed and cried many times! Such wonderful writing and really engaging characters!! I love this authors work!!I adore this whole series and can not wait to see each man get his lady. It is a bit formula with the alpha male who is often chased finding a lady he wants and being forced to pursue her. But formula works that why we love it!Each book has an add but of intrigue that draws you in. And Stephanie Laurens knows how to deliver the steam!!I am currently on a Regency kick and this one was terrific!!"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I haven't finished the book yet, but so far (a few chapters in) it is well written and is keeping my attention. I'll write another review after I finish."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Ok, let me say this. I liked most of the story and Kit was a great character up and until she losses her . . . to the hero and most of her common sense. I didn't much like Jack/Jonathan. I mean you can't find some opportunity to chat even after a great round of sex? I found that to be a little odd. The secondary characters were likable, George and Amy but it was a trifle to centered around Kit and Jack. I know, it was their story, but I like more interaction and dialogue. Well written as usual by this authoress and I will continue with the series, trying to get on track now after starting the series with \\"A Gentleman's Honor\\" and that one was more than good.So, my all means read this book, it is good and the underlying story of smuggling and spies is good, but Jack is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This is a series that doesn't necessarily have to be read in order & each one is so different! If you read the Bastion Club you HAVE to read the Cynster novels...excellent!,"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Another great book in the Cynster/Bastion Club series. I love the way Ms. Laurens ties all her series together. You can always recognize and remember the various characters mentioned from one book to another. I now have all the Bastion Club and Cynster Series books and will read them all again and again. Her writing is sexy, romantic, believable but not overly cheesy."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I have worked my way through Stephanie Laurens' novels and apart from her \\"Cobra\\" series I have enjoyed them all. This novel is another one of her romantic romps that never fail to make me feel happy and dare I say it, horny(giggle). A perfect combination to put you in a light-hearted good mood!"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This is the pivotal novel of Laurens' Cynster series & Bastion Club series. For those unfamiliar with Mz Laurens' writting, it is also a good intro to her writing style. Her character development is excellent & the interaction between the main characters is witty & playful. She gives both Kit's & Jack's reasoning & point of view so one can easily follow how each misinterprets the others actions & thoughts. This novel has humor & wonderful romance with plenty of action both in bed & with the \\"bad\\" guys. These characters will reappear in subsequentnovels, so remember them! I strongly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"The story started off interesting with Kit masquerading as a leader of a gang of smugglers and her escapades challenging Captain Jack and gang. However, the story sort of went flat after Kit succumbing to Jack's charm. She loses her adventurous spirit. It was not surprising that after the marriage, she was like another person. Everything became too predictable at the end and I almost could not finish reading the book. Erotic and passionate - Yes, but not exciting enough to maintain the thrill throughout."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Captain Jack's Woman was the first Stephanie Lauren book I read and I very much enjoyed it. Kit is a strong woman of adventure and Jack a wonderfully sexy male character. After reading this book I decided to buy anything that had Stephanie Lauren on the cover and I haven't been disappointed. Her Bar Cynster Series is a great read. I love series books and hope greatly that Stephanie will write about another character in this wonderful book. I look forward to any and all future books from this author."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"The book starts well, with a strong female character but when kit meets our hero she becomes irrational,irritating and weak time and time again. All it takes is a kiss and kit is unable to have a discussion about things that matter to her. Really, how sad is that she is so easily manipulated. I enjoy sex scenes but I'll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I really really liked this book....Captain Jack was very hot, very sweet, and you could tell he loved her. But every time he touched her, she melted and never said what she meant to say. She never argued, never said anything to gainsay him, not even at the end when she ran away and he came to get her. The reason I gave it a four was because I really liked the story and they were a great couple, but it just annoyed me that she was a strong character, but she never said anything."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"very entertaining book but got a little too ridiculous at times! i kept rolling my eyes because kit was always, always wearing men's clothing even when she didn't have to!and amazingly enough, this book has too much sex. i love a sensual, passionate romance novel probably more than most, but too much is too much and takes the steam out of things.jack was also a bit unlikeable at times."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Normally I love Stephanie Laurens' writing, but this book left me wanting to slap the heroine about once every twenty pages. It started off well - an independent, smart woman, and a smart but arrogant lord. She'll change him, right?Wrong. For the ENTIRETY of the book, she gets mad at him, plans to tell him how she feels, and somehow can't keep a coherent thought whenever he's around. So they have drawn out sex - and then the scene changes. Why doesn't she ask him after they get the physical stuff out of their system? Argh! He stays arrogant the whole time, and she accepts \\"he's arrogant but I love him anyway\\" instead of \\"I finally got him to admit I'm a valid person too.\\"All in all, I'll probably keep this book around because it's by Stephanie Laurens and I have the rest of hers, but it's not going to my \\"read this again\\" pile. Her Cynster books are much better."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"The writing talent is very good but... the characters hardly ever talked!!All of you 4-5 starers.Think about it. We ALWAYS read the characters &quot;thoughts' but there was hardly and verbal interaction.Did any of you notice that. It was very frustrating because the writing is very good .I skimmed a lot of pages. Being a &quot;reader of many books. I don't want to skimm."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"For those of you who despair at the fact that Stephanie Laurens Cynster heros are perfect, here she has created a hero who is flawed, and must face that by the end of the novel. Kit is a delight as a heroine, though she does shift halfway through the novel into something a little more tame, moving her passion from adventure to perfecting her husband. This was a great read. Not as good as the Cynster series, but still a well written and adventurous tale."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This book had a lot of potential. In the beginning the heroine Kit, was very funny and I loved her wicked side. She was one of the first historical heroines that I read, who was sure of her sexuality. The book was off to a great start, but half way through it just died. Kit lost her vivaciousness and wild streak. I ended up skimming through the end. I recommend this book though, because the beginning of their relationship was a great read."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I just enjoy Stephanie Laurens books and how she can take you back in time. Loved the interaction between the two characters."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Stephanie Laurens rocks as an author. She captures the readers interest and holds onto it until the book is finished. When the book is finished, the reader is enthralled enough to want to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This was one of Stephanie's greatest books I have read. I could not put it down. Even though I have read most all of the Bastian Club member books, this one still had me on the edge of my seat and I could not put it down. I always ALWAYS always reread all of my Lauren collection as with my Feehan collection. They are always entertaining and filled with such wonderful dialogue and truly fascinating expressions and descriptions."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This book is the prequel to the \\"Bastion Club\\" regency romance novels, and, despite being probably the most absurd, it is far and away the most entertaining of the nine books in the series.In fact it is jointly (withFour in Hand) my favourite Stephanie Laurens book.The Bastion Club series starts immediately after the battle of Waterloo, as described in \\"The Lady Chosen (Bastion Club)\\" as seven officers who have served Britain during the Napoleonic wars, first in the guards and latterly as spies, agree to support one another in time of peace. And particularly, as most of them need to marry, they set up the Bastion Club as a place where they can meet away from the \\"matchmaking mamas\\" of the Ton and ensure that each has the best chance of finding the wife who is right for him, not some simpering miss thrown at him by society.In the that book and the following six, all set between 1815 and 1816, each of the seven Bastion Club members finds his bride, as follows:1) The Lady Chosen, Tristan Wemyss and Leonora Carling2)A Gentleman's Honor, Tony Blake and Alicia \\"Carrington\\"3)A Lady of His Own (Bastion Club), Charles St Austell and Penelope Selborne4)A Fine Passion (A Bastion Club), Jack Warnefleet and Clarice Attwood5)To Distraction (Bastion Club Series),Jocelyn Deverell and Phoebe Malleson6)Beyond Seduction (Bastion Club), Gervase Tregarth and Madeline Gascoigne7)The Edge of Desire (Bastion Club Series), Christian Allardyce and Letitia Randall.And in the last volumeMastered By Love (Bastion Club), we find out who their mysterious former boss, the spymaster \\"Dalziel\\" really is, and it is his turn to find his lady.This book is set a few years earlier, in 1811, and fills in a story hinted at in \\"A Gentleman's Honour\\" when it was mentioned that Tony Blake, hero of that book, had been rescued from drowning in mysterious circumstances by Kathryn (Kit), the heroine of this one.At the start of this book, Kit Cranmer returns to the Norfolk home of her grandfather, Lord Cranmer, after several unsuccessful London seasons during which her aunts kept trying to marry her to men she despised to suit their husbands' ambitions.Riding around the Norfolk coasts she dresses as a boy, and through a series of ironic twists of fate becomes the ringleader of a gang of smugglers.At this point we hit the main fault in tbe book: it contains an implausible assumption made by an astonishing number of female regency romance writers, that a beautiful woman in riding clothes whose breasts have been bound and hair hidden can pass for a boy - except, perhaps, to the more discerning eye of the hero.Oh really, not if she has anything remotely resembling a good figure she can't!A young lady might get away with passing for a boy in loose clothing, but by definition an attractive woman has curves at the hips which men are biologically programmed to notice. In close-fitting clothes like riding breeches those curves will draw male attention the way an ultra-high-power electromagnet draws metal.Anyway, Kit soon comes into contact with a much bigger gang of smugglers run by the handsome and mysterious \\"Captain Jack\\" - a man with even more secrets than Kit has ...Stephanie Laurens has a brilliant pen, but she is in danger of becoming to the genre of Georgian Romances what Douglas Reeman is to Royal Navy fiction or Robert Ludlum to spy thrillers. E.g. a highly competent and entertaining writer, who has successfully published many best-sellers, but whose plots are so similar as to put her at risk of being accused of bringing out fifty variants of the same book.In no small measure, some of my enjoyment of this book was because \\"Captain Jack's Woman\\" ISN'T yet another minor variation of the same standard plot which Stephanie Laurens has used in three quarters of her recent novels. I'd better not try to list the differences because that would give the story away but I was pleased to read something a little different. The tale is utterly nonsensical for a whole host of reasons which, again, can't be explained in detail without spoiling the story, but not quite so much so as to make it impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This book was great. The story was very exciting and full of adventure and I just could not put it down. I adored Kit Cranmer's character and you can't help but love Captain Jack. Stephanie Laurens seems to have put a lot of thought into her characters and their personalities. A great quick read and it's filled to the brim with steamy love scenes.The story revolves around Catherine \\"kit\\" Cranmer who has a bit of a wild streak and enjoys riding her pure bread Arab across the country side dressed as a man in the dead of night. She ends up leading a small band of smugglers, and joins forces with the hunstanton gang and their leader Captain Jack. However the Hunstanton gang is smuggling more then just Brandy and Lace, and Kit has a bit of a problem when it comes to smuggling spies."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I loved this book! It was the first book I read by Stephaine Laurens. Her plot is full of twists and turns. It keeps you on the edge the entire book and trying to figure out what will happen next. Unlike other romance novels that are easily figured out. I look forward to reading more novels by Stephaine Laurens."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I go through romantic novels to the tune of a couple a week, and this one, although I read it several months ago, sticks in my mind as one that was thoroughly enjoyable and exciting. The heroine was daring and unique, and the writing was intelligent and fast-paced."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I loved it! This was the first book that I had read by her and I'm so glad that I did. To think that I almost passed it up! It has adventure, great sex scenes and wonderful characters. I really got into it. Kit, did tame down a bit after she married, but I like to think that was her maturing more to the role of a &quot;lady&quot; than wimping out. A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READ!"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"In 1811, Katherine &quot;Kit&quot; Cramer, sick of the marriage mart of the Ton and the machinations of some of her relatives, moves to Norfolk to spend time with her beloved grandfather. Before long, Kit becomes the leader of the local smuggling ring, whose members think she is just a brilliant, intrepid lad. At the same time, working for Whitehall, Lord Jonathan Hendon reprises his old war persona of &quot;Captain Jack&quot; so he can become the leader of the Hunstanton smuggling gang.The first evening that Jack meets the disguised Kit on the smuggler's beach, he quickly realizes that the charismatic leader of the rival gang is a woman, not the youthful lad that everyone else thinks she is. He finds her mysterious and alluring, and decides to expedite her from her nocturnal activities on the shore so that she can share his bed as his mistress. She thrives on her secret role and would never give it up, especially for a man, even if he stimulates her blood and is the most exciting person she ever met. What happens when these two highly spirited, adventurous beings continue to have their worlds collide? A love match ensues, but will the twosome stop their bickering long enough toallow a lifetime relationship to grow?CAPTAIN JACK'S WOMAN is an erotic, passionate, and action-packed historical romance that will thrill readers of the sub-genre. The lead protagonists are a wonderful pair filled with flaws that make them seem human, and the support cast adds a wild bunch type element to the tale. Stephanie Laurens scores big time with this sizzling romantic thriller that has this reviewer's highestrecommendation.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I don't see how anyone who is a fan of Laurens can not love this book. The only surprising factor here is that it appears to be her very first. Jack is everything a romantic hero should be and his Kit is a delightful scallywag of a heroine. Their adventures and love affair is fun, witty, sensuous and wildly sexy. I was sad to see it end. I would give it six stars."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I've read several of Ms. Laurens Regency novels and thoroughly enjoyed them; this, however, is a much larger book -- both in size and scope. Then I got into it, and I thought, Oh, no! Not another spunky, young, heroine who brings the mature hero to his knees, because she knows better about everything than he does.Oh, no! 'Tis not that way at all. This is a wonderful, swashbuckling period piece for (dare I say it?) intelligent readers of whichever sex who should happen to pick it up. It's quite true that Kit Cranmer is indeed a spunky heroine, but not so terribly young -- early to mid-twenties. And Captain Jack, now Lord Hendon, is indeed a mature hero, who brings Errol Flynn to mind in the blink of an eyelash.Kit has come back from an unhappy stay in London to stay with her grandfather, and promptly wanders her way into a smuggling den based on the coast facing France. The captain, home from the wars, is enlisted in a war against the smuggling of spies, but of course, first he must discern those smugglers from the ordinary contraband variety.Lots of laughs jump right off the pages of this delightful book, right along with sexual tension that is believable, for a pleasant change. And LOTS of it, plus the real thing. This is a very sexy book! Ms. Laurens deserves all the accolades she's accrued for this wonderful book, and I'll be part of the long line-up anxiously waiting for her next one."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I've read most of Stephnie Laurens work and it's still a toss-up to me as to which hero is the sexiest. Up til now, it was Sebastian in the Devil's Bride (Bar Cynster series), but Captain Jack (aka Lord Hendon) takes my breath away. On a scale of 1-10 for sensuality this is definitely a 10!Sensuality aside, I really liked the story! Lady Kit is fresh and alive. On a midnight ride,dressed as a lad, aboard her fabulous Arabian mare Delia, she inadvertently saves a small smugglers gang from being caught by the revenue men and becomes their leader, unbeknownest to them that she is a woman! After a few well devised and successful smuggling ventures, she runs into Captain Jack and becomes engaged with him in, of all things, a sword fight! Still disguised as a lad, Captain Jack is wondering why the slight lad is giving him uneasy thoughts.Well, and so it goes. The story is really quite good. Quite a lot of interaction (sex) between the two main characters, once Captain Jack figures out who Young Kit is. I love the strength and arrogance of Captain Jack, who really has a way of taming the beautiful, wild and passionate Lady Kit - very steamy sex scenes.If this was Ms. Laurens debut novel, it is no wonder she went on to such great success with her later entries! A definite keeper and one to be re-read and savoured again, and again."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I love Stephanie Laurens but I haven't been able to do more than skim this book. It has been pointed out to me that this is a reprint and so was probably written before her wonderful Cynster series. If I had know that before I tried to read it I would have been more open to the book, since I have seen just in Stephanie Lauren's Cynster series how her writing style has improved. Don't read it if you are expecting a book like On A Wild Night or All About Love. You should be able to read it, and probably enjoy it, if you realize from the start that this is an earlier story in her writing life. Some of the other reviews I have read about this book have pointed out that there is very little talking between characters. You read most of the story in their thoughts. I agree with this and it may have been why I had difficulty reading it, since most of what I enjoy is the verbal interaction between characters."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"At the beginning of the book, the main character, Kit, seems to finally be a heroine who has some backbone and is willing to stand up for herself. She dresses up as a boy so she can be the leader of a small group of smugglers and seems to have strong beliefs and morals (like against smuggling &quot;human cargo&quot;). But the minute she gets near &quot;Captain Jack&quot; she loses all rational thought. There isn't one decent conversation between her and him after he figures out she's a girl during the entire book because the minute they get near each other, she forgets everything except having sex with him. From the minute he touches her, her eyes glaze over and they end up in bed together (or on a table or the floor, or the ground...) You can't go thirty pages in the book without them making love. She never realizes her &quot;Captain Jack&quot; is really her neighbor Lord Hendon even though there's evidence of it right under her nose. Finally, she's shot, her grandfather finds out what she's been about and forces them to marry. The first thing her husband does is take away her favorite horse Delia, because she's &quot;too fast and the grooms can't keep up with her&quot; and gives Kit a old, slow, gentle mare instead. She tries to protest, but guess what, before she can voice her opinion, he gets near her, she loses all thought, and they end up in bed. After that, she quietly gives into his will, any time she doesn't like something he's done to change her life, he seduces her into shutting up about it. All the while, he's still been secretly leading their old group of smugglers, and smuggling spies even though he knows Kit would hate it. Although he has a good reason for it, he refuses to tell Kit what it is. Kit runs away to get his attention, but he can't even find her because he's never listened to a word she's said and has no idea where she would go. When they're finally reunited, she rushes back to him and asks to be taken home, but he decides to ignore her to &quot;punish&quot; her for making him worry about not knowing where she is. I could barely finish this book. The heroine went from being wild and likeable to submissive and bidable with only small sparks of her earlier fire. The hero thought the world revolved around him and even toward the end, still thought his wife should listen to him all the time, and only be wild when he wanted it. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"ok, basic story is a woman meets a many that she believes is a smuggler and predictably falls in love with him. he believes she is illegitimate and she believes he is a smuggler, not the high born noble that he really is.the story started off decently, with jack being a typical overbearing male, but with kit holding her own, at least most of the time. however, as soon as they had sex, she turned into an idiot. she couldn't think when he touched her, and she let him get away with ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING because as soon as he touched her she 'lost her mad' and couldn't remember what she was going to tell him.he got even more overbearing as the story went on, and instead of her dealing with it in a way that allowed her to keep her independence, she just bows to him. also, her cousins who had stood up for her against her aunts and uncles suddenly decide they don't have the guts to stand up to her husband or to help her. please, some continuity in the characters.in my opinion the ending ruined the book. i liked kit until the end, and didn't mind jack - he was perfectly redemable - but the ending made me dislike both of them. i didn't care whether they ended up together, and kinda hoped she would leave him and never come back.as a side note - i did kind of think there was a lot of sex as well. not that i have a problem with sex per se, but it seemed like it was just to fill the pages. to be perfectly honest, they were wasted pages, because the scenes lacked (at least to me) lacked any emotional impact.so, if you are a laurens fan, i would recommend this book, especially to give you a background for some of her other books. however, if you haven't read her before, don't start with this book."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I really enjoyed this well written fast paced book. I thought all the characters in this story interesting, not just the lovers Jack and Kit. I also got the impression that these two adventurous souls were meant to be together. They were going to meet and marry it was only a question of when. It just so happens they meet with blades drawn. It's wonderful romp, this book is a definite keeper. After my 25 years of romance reading Stephanie Laurens is a wonderful new voice."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I loved the idea of this book, and it had all the potential to be great, but it just sort of fizzled and died. I thought that it was pretty sexist too, Captain Jack was too shovanist for me and the heroine played right in to that. YUCK. But despite the absence of two characters who were equals and him really respecting her, it was a fun read, just not as great as it could have been if the hero and heroine had been better developed characters."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Oh, dear. So many people recommended this book, saying that they had delayed reading it because of the cheesy title, but it was wonderful. In a word, no.Sure, Laurens is the queen of the panting, highly explicit sex scene, but this book took even that to the point of ridiculousness. Not that that's too hard to do. My biggest beef with this book is that the strong, independent heroine became a total wimp every time the hero came near her. Their relationship was about sex not love; I can't see them making it as a lifetime couple. Jack always has to have the upper hand and Kit always gives in the moment he touches her.Silly.The first books in the Cynster series are Laurens' best -- you know, the ones before she starts getting repetitious."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I admit I've been disappointed in the last few of Ms. Laurens books I read, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this story so out of her usual story line.Kit is a high spirited young lady who resolves not to marry convinced she'll never find love. The ladies in her small home town plot to get her involved with Lord Hendon the area's most eligible bachelor and newly returned war hero. Kit is bored with the slow life and starts taking moonlight rides on her horse Delia dressed as a lad. She stumbles over a small smuggling gang and leads them out of danger when the watch almost catches them. She finds herself surprised when they make her or \\"the lad Kit\\" the leader of their gang. Soon a much larger gang takes over and she finds herself falling for their handsome leader Capt. Jack.Capt. Jack is really the pseudonym of Lord Hendon who is working undercover for the government to bust the real leaders behind a gang who is smuggling in spies from France. When his gang takes over the smaller gang, he almost immediately figures out Kit is a woman and falls for her, vowing to make her his mistress. He believes she is the illegitimate daughter of one of the local gentry and seduces her. When he finds out who she really is he vows to make her his wife. He doesn't however tell her the truth about who is he is really working for and she is worried when the gang starts bringing in spies.What is so great about this story is they take two characters who are head strong, but allow them to show their softer sides without ever appearing weak. Kit is the headstrong granddaughter who gets involved where she shouldn't, but she never comes across as spoiled or unlikable. Actually for once, the heroine is the perfect blend of sassy and smart and actually has some common sense. She is one of the best heroines in any book I've read yet. Jack is the man we all dream of having, he gets you all bothered just looking at you. He respects Kit more than most heroes in the regency books but sometimes still falls into that I'm the man , you're the woman trap. His strength is he does recognize that he and Kit are equals. If Ms Lauren had all books this refreshing , with original characters she'd never leave the best selling list."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I kept feeling it just gets better! Never boring. Not many scenes on board ship. They mostly stick to land. He's a spy posing as a smuggler -- she is smuggling - in breeches/disguise. Lots of excitement. Funny. Sexy. Kit tortures the Captain with her curiosity. He doesn't guess she's an innocent legit lady. A+ for sexual tension. It's my favorite by this author, though it's not said to be her best.This is kinda the beginning of the Bastion Series; but before the 'club' was created. We meet Tony from \\"Gentleman's Honor.\\""},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"Captain's Jack Woman was a wonderful introduction to Stephanie Laurens. I like the characters and the pace. Kit was headstrong but met her match with Jack. Because if this book, I have bought others books by Laurens. Now, I'm waiting for the next installment of the Bar Cynster!"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I couldn't finish it. I got to page 80 on my e-reader and couldn't get any further. The story just was not engaging for me. Maybe because so much of it was narration, which I don't mind as a tool to move the story along, but as the main style of story telling it loses me.So, I found myself on page 80 skimming along, not really caring if these two characters ever actually figure each others true identities out, ever fell in love, or got caught smuggling. I didn't care what happened to them.A part of my problem is that I have read and loved historical romances by Kathleen E. Woodwiss, Julie Garwood, and even more recently Lisa Kleypas and Elizabeth Hoyt. I've seen this style of tale (i.e. mistaken identities, historical espionage, girl disguised as boy, hero pretending to be someone else, heorine in an out-law role) done so well by Woodwiss and Garwood that it's hard to settle for anything else than a fully engaging story with dynamic characters."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I like this story very much and how Capt. Jack found his women but my only problem is I have read most of the \\"Bastion Club\\" novels and I just have more questions about his connections to the \\"Boys\\" in the following books than I had before!! But as a stand alone book it is really a great story. I like that Ms Laurens women are strong and independent minded even if they follow the rules and regulation of there class.... most of the time!"},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This is a great prequel to the Bastion Club Series.

I wish I could have got into the plot - smuggling. I didn'tfind that to be very exciting. I did like the rest of the book,though. One of my favorite parts was the night of the masquaradeball (which I wish had been longer than it was), where Kit iskidnapped by Jack and is sitting under a lover's bench, where a couple sits and all the lady can talk about is -- you guessed it --Captain Jack! Another passage I liked was when Jack bought Kit a riding outfit for their reception ride home. I also got a kick out of her grandfather, when Jack came right out & told him what wasgoing on. Jack really didn't have to say anything -- her grandpappy was very perceptive! I made sure, after reading about3 or 4 books in a row where a redhead was the central character,to find a book about a brunette."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"After stumbling onto the Bar Cynster series (which has his moments but overall I love it) I was really disappointed with this book.

I'm looking forward to the next Cynster book which are on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"This book is a disappointment in many ways. It begins rather well, but the characters are not allowed to evolve, and the plot - which could have been excellent - fails miserably mainly because ms. Laurens time and again has her main characters jumping into bed instead of working out their problems. Don't get me wrong - I enjoy reading those scenes as much as the next person - but in this book they really get in the way. Frankly it feels as if the author tries to put as much erotic action into the story in order to avoid expanding the plot. Jack's personality also irritated me to the point of dislike. Obviously(!) he enjoys going to bed with Kit. But to do it constantly to avoid talking with and listening to his own wife? Sorry - &quot;that don't impress me much!&quot; In addition there is a certain feel of anachronism to the whole thing, which is very dissapointing considering ms. Laurens' other work."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"The Cornish smugglers fascinate me as much as the Scottish reivers. Of course it wouldn't be complete without a young woman trying to fool all into thinking she is a man. Along with sword fights, running from the revenuers, great horsemanship. As it says, midnight gallops and trysts in the hidden cottage. Anyway, what can I say, I liked it and am glad I won the auction bid."},{"Title":"Captain Jack's Woman","review":"I really disliked this book. I felt manipulated by the end.

The book (unfortunately for me) was written mostly from the UNIX perspective, and for those who already know something about Apache servers. The Windows Apache sections, which paralleled the Unix OS, seemed to take a backseat to nearly every discussion (configuration, switches/flags, etc). It was also too technical and written over my head--consequently, I eventually bought APACHE SERVER FOR WINDOWS (of the Coriolis Technology Press's series, &quot;Little Black Books&quot;).I'd recommend this excellent book, written by Greg Holden (Copywrite 1999, ISBN1-57610-391-9). This book presented the steps (with great explanations) that I needed to easily set up the Apache Server. It has breath enough for more expert users, too; and its content was equal or greater than the O'Reilly press's &quot;Definitive Guide&quot;.

When I first got the book, I agreed with other readers' complain of poor organization. However, after 1 hour of reading it, I began to realized that I was wrong. The unique part of this book is that instead of teaching you about install and configure apache on the first shot. It actually teaches you the more detailed configuration by trying different option one at a time. This way, you learn more about the internal of the apache instead of compile and install based on the original options set by apache.org. This way, you can avoid many problems that might occur later on. By the way, if you don't know much about linux/unix, don't bother to install apache on a linux/unix machine."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"O'Reilley and Associates seems to have a knack at publishing good, solid technical manuals -- and &quot;Apache: The Definitive Guide&quot; is no exception.One of the best features of this book is the assumption that the reader knows nothing about web servers, and builds a good solid knowledge of apache, the most popular web server on the internet today (and one of only a few offering true HTTP-compliance). The book guides the reader through the purpose of Apache, the HTTP protocol, and then on to writing Apache config files from scratch (once you learn how to do this, you'll never want to use the default config). From there, the book goes on to discuss advanced topics such as server-side includes, Secure socket layer, and even a reference into the Apache API.The only suggestion I'd add -- when you try the examples in this book, make sure you have a clean install of Apache. If you're on linux, don't use the version of Apache that shipped with your system -- start from scratch, follow the book. For windows users, don't be intimidated by the lack of a visual front-end (this is actually a benefit on a real production web server). Follow the book and all the special notes for Win32, and you'll be an Apache guru in no time."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"I would imagine that the book might be easier to follow if I had done exactly what the authors do, which is to install FreeBSD and then install Apache with the included CD-ROM. But that's not really an option in most cases unless you can afford to have a separate machine that doesn't have the standard Linux installation on it, just for following the book. I've learned a lot more about how to set up Apache to properly on Linux (Redhat 6.2) by searching around the web and reading the online documentation than from this book. This is so disappointing, because like others, I usually love anything that is published by O'Reilly. The only thing that stops me from giving it a lower rating is that some of the information is kind of useful. I have Professional Apache on order now, and I'm hoping for more from that."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"An unwelcome reminder that not everything that comes from O'Reilly is top notch.This book seems to have been written half heartedly. The explanations of many of the directives in the configuration file seem to be repetitions of online manual contents with the authors not taking the time to provide really useful insights or clarify difficult concepts.The attitude of the book seems to be: &quot;This is what we did to get Apache running on BSD and Windows. If it helps you, great, if not, tough !&quot;I also have a doubt about the technical credibility of the authors. Their advice seems glib and dubious at times.I have run Apache on Windows before without consulting documentation and I expected to learn something useful from this book. Not in the 1st three chapters.Not a great tutorial. Not a very good reference manual.One of the few books I would lend to someone and probably not worry about it being returned."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"Really, this book can be described as the Apache httpd manual in much greater detail.The book covers pretty much everything you might want to know about running Apache on a *nix or Windows Operating System, but the basic attitude toward Windows users is \\"If it doesn't work for you - tough luck\\", which is fine, since Apache really isn't meant to run on Windows as anything more than a test server anyway. Still, I fear that a lot of the Windows folks who are jumping into the Open Source craze may pick this book up and be greatly disappointed.Another problem I had with the book was the fact that it plays out as more of a step by step manual for setting up specific features of Apache. This makes it fairly difficult to use it for reference later on, but perhaps the idea was that once you got through this book, you could use the web and the manual as a reference instead.All in all, the book is fairly useful, it just takes some getting used to. If you plan to use it to set up a Windows server, you'd probably be better off braving the various forums and threads out there available to Apache users. However, if you have a good Operating System (BSD, Unix, or Linux), and you want some extra help setting up your Apache server, or setting up specific parts of your Apache server, by all means give this book a shot. It's an above average book, but it's below average by O'Reilly standards."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"This book is clearly written in understandable english.

Coming over from the M$ world where everything is a GUI, the httpd.conf file was a bit frustrating. Apache's online documentation was not newbie friendly. This book bridges that gap. I liked the way they begin with NO conf file and explains the Apache errors, and how to fix it in the conf file. The book then goes on adding additional functionality and options.This book does not explain every configuration option available to Apache, and it is a bit outdated (covers up to version 1.3.n). The book did come with a CD with sample conf files, but I found that I didn't even need to use them.

In addition, there is a lack of continuity between one experiment in configuration and the next. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's unclear who the intended audience is. I'm sure at some point I'll get some value from the API documentation, but as a newbie to Apache, I've learned considerably more through trial and error on my own than by reading this book."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"This book is targeted at the wrong people. It's written at a level of detail that falls somewhere between what you'd need if you already know how to work with Apache and that you'd need if you've never worked with it before. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to provide the information that's really most-needed for either end of the spectrum. There's little more than hand-waving over how and where to set up webs on a server or how to deal with configuration differences in Unix flavors. And the organization appears to be a weird hybrid between the &quot;read all and understand&quot; and the &quot;do as you read&quot; models for software books. My advice: Look for another book, or look this one over very carefully to make sure it's suitable for your level of experience and learning style."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"This book will not teach you how to set up Apache if you've never done it before, but is a handy guide for Security, LogFormat configuration etc. Although it could be more readable, if you ever touch a .conf file you should have this on your desk."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"For anyone new to Apache, The Definitive Guide is, by far, the best bet.

This book is not up to par with other O'Reilly editions. It is a good reference, though not worth the price considering the on-line docs are free. Also, there is something about the tone of the book and the writing style that seemed inappropriate for a technical book. Attempting to be funny in a private sort of way, poking fun at sales types and company motives. It gets old pretty quick.The book repeatedly stresses that Win32 is not a serious platform for securing web sites. This is true, but many of us have no choice.

Well...isn't that what books are for?Don't bother with the book if you're on Win32."},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"I respectfully disagree with most of the reviews I've read in this book. As the back ofthe book states it is designed primarily for those who are \\"new\\" to Apache (as I am).

It takes you through the evolution of a sample site and allows you to see and witness how theApache configuration changes to accomodate the web site. It teaches you by doing, not just by abunch of idle, technical words. I have not finished the book yet, but I have already set up Name-based,IP-based, Mixed-based hosts etc... with great ease.

This book is great for the Apache beginner,Take it from me :)"},{"Title":"Apache: the Definitive Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"I had been dealing with Apache before I purchased this book, and I tell you, learnt a lot. The feature of the book that I liked the most was illustration servers that they build on each chapter (almost on each chapter). Every single configuration is built upon the previous one. For example, they build the first web server in chapter 2, site.toddle with just the following configuration:User webuserGroup webgroupServername yourmachinenameDocumentRoot /usr/www/site.toddle/htdocsThen in the following chapters they introduce different issues, and keep adding lines to the above configuration file and building seperate versions of more advanced sites.However, there're several things that you might wanna be aware of before purchasing this book. Although the above mentioned feature of the book claims it's well-organized, it's not. Some of the directives just pop-up in the middle of the discussion, where they are not supposed to belong. I found that pretty annoying and confusing. I can recall the one about CERN Metafiles in chapter 3. Another annoying thing was the way they introduce directives. Consider the following lines from page 53:ServerSignature [off|on|email]Default: offDirectory, .htaccess[ ...6 line description follows...]Yes, it reminds me of the Apache's online documentation (which even does way better job than the above cold-blooded description). Of course, one expects more from a book than citing the online documentaion.If you want to know what kind of audience the book is designed for, my answer is straightforward: I don't know, period! I have a feeling even the authors don't know anything about their potential readers. They try to get as detailed as they can where it doesn't make sence to do so. And when you expect some detail, they just ignore you.I used the book as a referense during my internship, but it still didn't keep me from having to visit apache.org for more details.

This book skips over the essentials and the basics and wanders off to discuss odd topics that have never been of concern to me. Pretty much a waste of money and shelf space.

The tutorial approach makes it easier for sys admins and programmers to learn how to install and maintain an Apache server. The examples of the butterhlies company make the concepts a little easier to follow.

I can see this book being a little useful for beginners, but even then, it's not really getting into very detailed information about the configurations and whatnot for module installs/additions. I can see someone new still getting frustrated with this book if they run into a problem.I picked it up, well, because I buy every O'Reilly book that comes out (seriously) and thought I might be able to find something interesting, useful or that I wasn't aware of or forgot... maybe even a little tip about efficiency, compiling options or just anything of interest.This is no more useful than the README and INSTALL files that come with Apache's source code.

Each chapter starts out with a page or two of well-written text, then, just when you become interested you're faced with page after page of configuration settings, with very little explanation of what each setting does or, more importantly, why you would ever care what it does. Worse, the authors tend to use a lot of words where a few would have been better. For example, instead of just saying that Apache would report an error they say &quot;you have a problem that's signaled by disagreeable messages at the client end, plus equivalent stories in the log files on the server...&quot;Huh?As I said in the title, you'd be better off printing the Apache help, because at least it's free."},{"Title":"A history of costume","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child.

On the plus side, Kohler includes pictures of a great many extant garments, which are invaluable as a resource (the book's value as a source rises considerably after 1500 for this reason). On the other hand, there are many &quot;patterns&quot;--especially in the medieval period--which, unless you read carefully, can be interpreted as being taken from extant garments, and the introduction claims almost outright that these diagrams are &quot;correct.&quot; They are not, being instead Kohler's own hypotheses. Many of them do not work as patterns. I have known many a beginner who took these diagrams as gospel and have ended up with nothing resembling an actual medieval garment. Use the illustrations (but not the &quot;patterns&quot;) and the book can have some degree of usefulness."},{"Title":"A history of costume","review":"Amazing that the original author's name is listed without the names of the editor and translator.Author Carl Kohler died in 1876 near Nurnberg, Germany. His paintings and writings, upon which this particular reprint of a compilation are based, were previously published, intact, in German under the names \\"Die Trachten der Volker in Bild und Schnitt\\" and \\"Die Entwicklung der Tracht in Deutschland wahrend des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit\\", both in the late 1870s.Emma Von Sichart, the editor of this publication, took it upon herself in the early 1920s to gather up Kohler's sketches, drawings, paintings, and writings, and put them together in a new book. During the process, she deleted almost all of Kohler's introductory or period descriptive writings, and replaced those words with either her own, or Max von Boehn's, another historian.In addition, Emma Von Sichart added new, contemporary photographs and sketches to bring Kohler's work \\"up to date\\", at least as far as the very late 1920s. In many places she eliminated or changed Kohler's measurements, or interpretations of the cut of clothing, simply to make the work more \\"accessible\\" to the seamstress, costumer, or interested reader of the early 20th century.Further, in order to bring the publication to English speaking markets, Emma Von Sichart's writing was translated by Alexander K. Dallas, M.A., which might have further changed the original content.So, before we blame Kohler, who, in his time, was very highly regarded as a serious historian and quite the expert in period clothing, styles, customs, etc., we must first look to the likelihood of errors created by the editor Emma Von Sichart, and the translation errors of Alexander K. Dallas.If by any chance you have the original German publications of the late 1870s, you do indeed have a spectacular rare treat of period costume history.Just keep in mind that this particular book is a facsimile reprint of a translation of a heavily edited and recompiled selection of at least two originals."},{"Title":"A history of costume","review":"The text of this book is dry, but very informative. There are many sketched and black and white illustrations, but not enough to fully support the text. (I recommend Boucher's 20,000 Years of Fashion as a companion). The patterns give a better idea of the construction of the clothes, but they are approximations and no tips are given for making your own. Make sure you refer to other sources before using his patterns.

It also contains a few patterns that are minimally useful (lack or proportion or instruction, etc.) except to understand the anatomy of the garments and how the pieces might fit together. No color pictures, but enough illustrations and primary resources to contribute to an overall sense of a period in costume history."},{"Title":"A history of costume","review":"This is one of the first costume references I got when I began to study the subject in college.

Intended for young adults, yet accessible to anyone who may be fuzzy on the details of Catholicism, The Catholic Faith Handbook For Youth covers creed, sacraments, morality, and prayer, along with articles concerning information on current events from a Catholic point of view, advice for prayer, profiles of thirty-seven Catholic saints, notes on the history of the Catholic Church, and more.

Far too often the authors make false distinctions between a supposed \\"old\\" Church that existed before Vatican II and a \\"new and improved\\" Church that exists now. For instance, they describe worshippers before the council as \\"not participants as much as watchers, separated by distance, architecture, and language.\\" Nowhere in the documents of Vatican II or in authoritative pronouncements from the Magisterium will you find such a sweeping, negative assessment.The authors also claim that Vatican II removed Latin from the liturgy, when in reality the Council fathers instructed that \\"[t]he use of the Latin language is to be preserved ...\\" (albeit with an allowance that some of the vernacular may be incorporated.) Likewise, Vatican II had nothing to do with communion in the hand, an innovation introduced in the United States and other Western countries years later; the authors list it as an achievement of the Council. A frequent theme of this book on liturgical matters is disruption instead of continuity.In the chapter on the Bible, the authors operate from the presumption readers believe the Gospels were written soon after Jesus' death and Resurrection. To the extent teens have thought about this question at all, it's more likely that they believe the more pervasive false notion that the Gospels were written hundreds of years later. (See Dan Brown's \\"Da Vinci Code.\\")Perhaps one day someone will take the recently-releasedUnited States Catholic Catechism for Adultsand adapt it for teens. In the meantime, this book is a flawed substitute.

There is more to Catholicism than what meets the eye and what goes down at mass. Faith plays an important part in Catholic faith. Dectractors of Catholicism say that it's out of date, but remiains the world's number one religion. It's your choice- you either go to heaven or hell- up or down. Death has been described as a dream- like state of oblivion or an eternal slumber. Hell has been said is an eternal torment. Satanist groups have perpetuated far more than they've destroyed.

By coincidence he died at the same age as Sigmund Freud (l856-1939), whose concepts Rieff spent much of his life studying, analyzing and explaining. A universal scholar, decribed by colleages as a \\"kind of genius\\", Rieff was uniquely qualified to write this study of Freud.Philip Rieff was never a \\"public intellectual\\" nor did he aspire to be. His work was written mainly for the culture elites (professional intellectuals and academics) who in modern times have replaced \\"ministers\\" as guides toward right thinking, and its corollary, right conduct.When this, his first work, came out (while he was teaching at U. C. Berkeley) he was feted by San Francisco's high society and soon discovered he was an ornament for party givers to impress party goers, none of whom had read his book. However, the book was read in the groves of the learned and Rieff was rewarded in 1959 with a chair at the University of Pennsylvania. He remained at U. of P. until being forced to retire in 1993.Freud: The Mind of The Moralist is impossible to summarize. A critic once remarked that reading Rieff is like chewing ball bearings and finding the occasional cherry. I would add that even the cherry has a jaw breaking pit. This book is a rigorous exposition of the intellectual and moral implications of Freud's thought.Rieff holds that Freud's thought is not only a critique of modernity, but is itself a symptom of modernity. And the emergence of \\"psychological man\\", described in the final chapter, is the ultimate expression of modernity. Psychological Man is the \\"ideal type,\\" (viz. Max Weber) now populating the Western world. Psychological man does not believe in anything except his own sense of well being, and to this end Freud is the perfect therapist.Rieff's book raises, once more, in a very complex, way, the question of nihilism; the specter of which, since the French revolution, has hung over the culture of the modern West .Freud: The Mind of the Moralist, was first published in 1959; the second edition followed shortly thereafter in 1961, and in 1979 this third, and final edition. There are no revisions of substance in either the second or third editions, although in these later editions Rieff wrote significant prefaces about the character and private life of Freud. The second editon preface, which contains an assessment of Freud's correspondence, is included here in the third edition.This work is not, as another reviewer suggests, a biography, nor is it a summary of Freud's ideas. It is sociologist Rieff's critical analysis of Freud's thought and how it is both symptom and explanation of the death of culture in the West."},{"Title":"Freud: The Mind of the Moralist","review":"Freud was never really young. He was burdened by the wisdom of age. Sigmund Freud's task was the stripping of concealments. He could not abandon physiological presuppositions. Freud derived ideas on psychology from his French sources. His elegant and precise writing style displayed qualities of intellectual patience and thoroughness. Freud's theory of instinct demonstrate the contradictions in nature and culture. Neurotic symptoms are a mask for memory. Freud was fond of the rhetorical device, synecdoche, in which the name of a part or attribute is made to stand for the whole.The sense of inevitability in Freud's teachings are in conflict with the myth of democratic culture. The author charges that Freud never understood the ethic of self-sacrifice. In Freud's scheme the super-ego inherited the Oedipus Complex. The Freudian case histories are vigorously intellectual.The term analysis carries a rationalist promise. Nevertheless, dream is not faithful translation, it is not point for point projection. Nothing is unmediated meaning. The analytic method is indirect. Freud provides a critique of romantic love. Freud describes the psychological process out of which myth develops. He does not distinguish human purpose from natural development.Freud's messianic strain caused him to admire resolute minorities. He revered the moral tenacity of the Jews. He named one of his sons after Oliver Cromwell. He would have preferred an heroic father to a prudent one. Psychoanalysis defends the private man from public encroachment. Freud connected religion with an emotional need for authority. The author speaks of the euthanasia of religion by Freud. Instinctual desire may be the displacement of frustrated moral aspiration. There is a Freudian ethic of honesty.The book seeks to overturn some of the popular misconceptions of Freud and his discipline."},{"Title":"A History of Freedom of Thought","review":"It is well written, and I recommend this book for anyone interested in history of free thinking."},{"Title":"The 10 Smartest Decisions a WOMAN Can Make Before 40","review":"I'm well past 40 but I still have trouble making decisions and looked at this book partly to see if it would be helpful for my daughter, who also has trouble making decisions.

The 19th century sociologist and philosopher, Herbert Spencer, has long been the bete noir of progressives and socialists for supporting an allegedly anarchic laissez faire policy of government non-intervention and social Darwinism. The odd thing about today's Republicans, \\"conservatives\\" or \\"right-wingers\\" is the way they seem to join with the left in denouncing Spencer and laissez faire. For instance, many Republicans staunchly defend the Democrat party's largest government programs as if they were defending their own mother: Most Republican politicians today not only refrain from attempts to abolish the New Deal Social Security program but actually express eagerness to save and preserve this Democrat expansion of the welfare state, and in doing so often reject the alleged laissez faire policies of the 1930-40s conservatives who opposed the New Deal . The mystery grows deeper when we actually read the 1930-40s opponents of the New Deal such as Ogden Mills in his anti-New Deal manifesto, The Seventeen Million, and find that this Depression-era conservative also distanced himself from laissez faire in favor of some level of intervention (Mills 1937 p.40). Even Hayek, who apparently knows the true meaning of laissez faire (Hayek 1994 p.89-90), spends some ink denouncing certain \\"wooden\\" or \\"dogmatic\\" laissez faire attitudes (p.21,41).What might, but should not, surprise modern readers is that Spencer supported government intervention because laissez faire does not reject all intervention (1981 p.21). Indeed, laissez faire requires government intervention. Laissez faire is not anarchy because we already have a word for anarchy called \\"anarchy.\\" Laissez faire is the exact opposite of anarchy because laissez faire is the rule of law. The premise of laissez faire is to establish the framework in which individuals may freely allocate resources, a legal framework established by government intervention to secure defense, fair trial and property rights (guaranteed process). Thus, a laissez faire government does not order what contract you must sign but, once you freely contract with someone, the laissez faire government is pledged to intervene to enforce your contract rights if the other party defrauds or reneges. This is opposed to the central planning of socialism which prevents individuals' free allocation of resources and freedom to contract in order to engineer some pre-ordained social goal (guaranteed result). Social democrats oppose many market results which occur when laissez faire \\"only\\" guarantees process-- although it is not quite clear how government central planning is more democratic than the market result from the aggregate preferences of millions of free-choosing consumers.The other longstanding myth, which even modern conservatives propagate, is the false caricature of Spencer as a callous, social Darwinist and classic, Victorian scrooge. First, it is important to understand Spencer's argument that certain imperfections and undesirable results hardly invalidate laissez faire, because \\"it is not a question of absolute evils; it is a question of relative evils-- whether the evils at present suffered are or are not less than the evils which would be suffered under another system\\" (8). Although Spencer opposed the socialism of many \\"progressives,\\" it is clear that Spencer was a progressive who desired the amelioration of the common man and working poor-- improvements most likely gained by laissez faire, according to Spencer. In this 1891 book, Spencer took pains to avoid any misunderstanding on this crucial point, although his ideological enemies and history seemed happy to ignore his efforts: \\"Let me again repudiate any erroneous inference. Any one who supposes that the foregoing argument implies contentment with things as they are, makes a profound mistake. ... My opposition to socialism results from the belief that it would stop the progress to such a higher state and bring back a lower state. ... It is not then, chiefly in the interests of the employing classes that socialism is to be resisted, but much more in the interests of the employed classes\\" (p.29-32). Thus, the other benefit of this book is to indicate the humane compassion of this poor, traduced, laissez faire advocate.This is the advantage of primary sources; to read not what others wrote about Spencer's thoughts and writing but to read what the man actually wrote. A greater effort to verify claims by primary sources would redress a legion of falsehoods. This book provides not just the original writings of Spencer but those of numerous, able thinkers of the Victorian era."},{"Title":"Introduction To High Power Pulse Technology (Advanced Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering)","review":"The good: This book covers many diverse aspects of pulsed power technology, including insulation, switching, pulse generators, and diagnostics.

With a few editing changes, this story could pass as a novel written about the beginning of the 21st century rather than the 20th, as it is truly penned by a very famous Indiana author, pastor, and writer of many books including \\"The Robe\\", \\"The Big Fisherman\\", \\"Magnificent Obsession\\", and many others several of which were turned into film. This book could be done into a contemporary life film, complete with widespread economic hardship.It is the story of a lady (Hannah Parmalee) who self appoints herself to be a family housemaid, when the family, headed by Philosophy Professor Paul Ward, is tight for funds. She makes herself indispensable, immediately. she also has a secret past which is kept secret to all. The tale takes place in northern Indiana, much in Waterloo, Indiana, and mentions early the midsummer of 1916 and before the final page, the Wall Street Crash of 1929.It is not a religious book like some of Douglas' more famous books-to-movie have been, but it does take an in-depth look at the struggles of lower and middle class life in America. At honesty. At integrity. The astonishing part is the book's application of divorce, single parenting, credit dangers, technology innovation, adoption, and many other topics, often discussed in the book between the maid and the professor. I thought these topics seem more 21 century than early 20th, but then I didn't live in that time. What is apparent, this book is timeless. With the family action taking place 90 years earlier, the reader forgets it is describing the first decade of the 21st century (with a few exceptions). It is a delight to read, just for that reason.Running up \\"White Banners\\" instead of 'white flags' means taking a new position--not surrendering, not quitting, regardless of what life has to toss in our path. The protagonist lives that life, and often shares her philosophy of life with others, young and old.The fact that \\"WHITE BANNERS\\" is older, only available in previously owned copies, makes it a value.

I only wish I had something like this when I was self-teaching myself FrontPage 1.1. Jim Buyens is to be praised for the clarity and detail he put into this book. In plain english, he not only describes the uses of FrontPage, but he actually goes and explains aspects about the Internet that can often be confusing. Jim picks up where the normal FrontPage documentation leaves off. If I had a question on how basic or advanced features worked in FrontPage, all I needed to do was check the index and flip to the section. On very rare occasions, will I loan this book out, and even then, it is never far from my cubicle. You want to learn FrontPage? This is the book for you."},{"Title":"Running Microsoft Frontpage 98","review":"I liked this book because Jim Buyens is strong where I am weak--the network environment. I work at home, and it is hard for me to understand how the PWS works. Something goes wrong, and I don't know what to do because I am dealing with software more complex than programs and files. This is the best book that I have found to help me understand how a PWS works."},{"Title":"Running Microsoft Frontpage 98","review":"The book was a good book. Let's get that straight. It provided in-depth info on almost everything imaginable. Herein was a bit of a problem, however, because he did a little too much describing. For example, Chapter 4 is all about colors. Instead of just sticking to explaining how FrontPage handles colors, he goes off explaining Hexadecimal, CMY, RGB, and the scientific view of light and color. He also gets into screen brightness in that chapter.Overall I say it's a good buy, but you might get a little bored reading some parts."},{"Title":"Running Microsoft Frontpage 98","review":"Many books on the market focus on the features of a product and forget about the product as a whole. This book focuses on the product and then shows you what it can do. In addition to the excellent discussion and examples on how to use FrontPage and all it's features, this book also gives you some of the best gems on getting FrontPage to work for you the way you expect it to. This book presents a great general backgrounder whether you are a complete novice, or a FrontPage ace that wants to learn about a feature that you are unfamiliar with."},{"Title":"Running Microsoft Frontpage 98","review":"This book is fluff. There is just as much if not more pertinent information in the manual shipped with FrontPage 98 as there is in this book. If your into page after page of non FrontPage information then this book is for you."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"I didn't like this book very much. It tries to cover a lot of items, but it doesn't cover them well. For example a lot of commands are just mentioned, but not really explained. And a lot of important things are missing. And what I really didn't like are the jumps in the level of the explanations. Some things are explained over and over again and others a little bit more complicated are mentioned as if they had been explained earlier. I wouldn't recommend this book, because for a beginner there are a lot of things not clearly explained and for an expert it is not really useful, because it's not very compact."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"I have collected quite a few linux books and this one ranks as one of the top 5 books. This book covers the level 1 certification exams for LPI, RHCE and SAIR, and that alone makes this book worth purchasing. Each chapter contains questions about the items covered so you can stay focused, also there are some more questions at the back of the book and there are 2 75 questio sample exams on the cd. The material was covered in detail and with clarity, and I would recommend this book to anyone thinking of acquiring level 1 certification in linux."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"After reading the book cover to cover while preparing for the exam, I found that there were far too many errors. Some mistakes include answers to the chapter end tests not coinciding with the questions asked, index items not pointing you to the right pages(look up the print daemon, commands in the index). The mistakes left me with the feeling that this book was rushed out with out being proof read, leaving me with little confidence that the material I was reading was a good reflection of what would be on the exam. The CD provides 2 exams of 75 questions each that do not change each time you take them. Overall I felt the book did a good job with the topics that it covered, but would recommend you look elswhere for a book to help prepare you for the exam."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"I have about 4 books on linux topics, and I bought this exam book for a specific reason--to quiz me over commands and switches and to provide hands-on exercises. The best linux book I go to is LINUX, Second Edition: Installation, Configuration, and Use, (on installation, linux apps such as emacs, news readers and gimp)which is still current. Another book I really like for detailed examples of all the strange linux/unix commands is: A Practical Guide to Linux (1997) by Mark G. Sobell. Despite the date, all of the material is still current For general networking issues I have RH Linux Unleashed. It is rather boring, but it contains a lot of answers about network stuff and some of the RH interfaces (gnome, kde). This book (GENERAL LINUX I EXAM PREP) is excellent because it answers a lot of ordinary how-to questions, how to get basic things done that sometimes are impossible to find in other books without rereading two chapters or so Example: I was looking for how to change the init level, and while I was looking for fstab info, I found in this book a command &quot;init 5&quot; which will also do the job. I've learned some nice tricks from this book.However, the main problem in the book is that it lacks detail on the certification exams. This is certainly not the author's fault because the LPI exams were still being developed, and the others have been changing as well. I'm taking the LPI 1a exam, and this book merely lists the goals of the tests rather than listing the specific subjects being tested. It would be nice if the organization of the book follows the organization of a specific test. I predict that by the end of the summer the market will be flooded with books about linux certification exams (mostly red hat certifications) so you'll be able to find books with more specific test information. (also you can find excellent information at places like cramsession for more recent information about the test. In summary: an excellent learning vehicle, with good test questions, but little specific test information."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"Excellently comprehensive coverage.

Get real and pass this loser by."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"Great insights into the world of Linux, including what must be the best Hands-On Projects sections for any Linux book. Only complain is that the Title is misleading (not to be confused with LPI's General Linux I) and that the information could be better organized. What I mean is that the book tries to cover too much ground--claims that you can use it for LPI, SAIR/GNU and RHCE exams--NOT!!If you can navigate without the benefit of a proper system which maps the exam objectives, perhaps, but my advise is not to rely solely on this book if you wish to attain some form of certification under your belt. Otherwise, this book provides a top-rated section for practical lab exercises and some gems, but you gotta dig real hard for it and be able to recognize it too!"},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"I am preparing for the LPIC exam and have not found this book that helpful.

I have found that combination particularly beneficial in my preparation. This book has potential but definitely needs to be rewritten."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"When I was first learning linux I must have tried almost everybook on the market. This book however takes the cake. Weather it is your intention to pass the LPI exam to just learn how to run linux, this is the book for you. The book covers linux from how the operating system works to managing users and networking. In my opinion this is the best book out there for linux.

Coriolis has now put together a book the covers the Linux Professional Institute's Exam 101 and you have a go to reference book.In just over 650 page the book breaks down the exam objectives completely and detailed. The book covers areas like hardware and installation, Software and installation, management, file systems, booting, shut down and run levels.There is also coverage of shells, scripting, programming, compiling, and administrative tasks associated with the operating system. Linux is the fastest rising OS on the market and this book gives you the basics in a simplified yet easy to follow manner.Make no mistake about it, Linux is a complicated operating system with a new look and for those like me, this book clears up and takes the mystery out of the care and maintenance of the software. Included with the book is hands-on projects and review questions.Keep in mind this a General Linux, so you'll need a version of the OS in order to perform the hands-on projects. The book comes with a cd-rom that has 2 complete exams and other questions to enhance your learning. Overall a very good value and an excellent learning tool."},{"Title":"General Linux I Exam Prep (Exam: 101)","review":"This book sucks! It appears to be the authors first attempt at writing and she obviously has trouble in deciding the flow of information. The author is a RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer) and it show's in this book. The LPI exam is suppose to be general and not distribution specific, this is something the author obviously doesnt know or just really didnt care. This book was obviously not edited for accuracy either. Wanna fail the LPI exam, then purchase this book.

Lisson has obviously done her homework and her version is darker, more midieval and probably closer to the truth.However, she does have the Irish characters speaking like Clancy the New York Cop and frequently uses Gaelic words without any explaination. I agree that most of the characters are one dimensional, it's hard to get too upset when Art dies, for instance. The English are depicted as bloodthirsty dolts and simply evil. The English commander is amazed when Hugh, a Catholic aristocrat, speaks Latin. Well, duh!The politics is too black and white as well. In real life, the O'Neill, Red Hugh's ally, had been well within the English camp until rebellion seemed more attractive. Irish politics has never been clear cut, but in a youth book I guess you have to simplify a bit.In short, a great adventure tale for most everyone. For folks looking for real O'Donnell history, buy both this and Reilly, then shake them together and distill the truth.PS - there is a third Red Hugh book that is sometimes available on Amazon. It is a dense scholarly pamphlet that reads like a doctoral thesis. This is most likely the most historically accurate of all accounts of this story that are easily available. Definitely not a kids' book though!"},{"Title":"Unix Secrets","review":"Not very often do you come across a book that is so informative and well put together.

Part diplomat, part train operator and a lot of muscle are all needed to operate these antiquated beasts of the train world and this book looks at stories told by the cable car gripmen and conductors. Many of the stories are humorous, while informing the reader on the operations and dangers of the system.This may not be to the liking of a native who rides the cars every day, but to anyone not familiar with the system or who rides only occasionally on a visit, this book is fun and interesting as well as entertaining.

His translations, though they may serve the uncritical reader well enough for ordinary purposes, ought wherever possible to be supplemented by alternate translations as they cannot be relied upon for scholarly purposes. Cleary's work tends to be uneven, with some of his books being much better than others.Dogen's Japanese is highly idiosyncratic and extremely difficult, so much so that some Japanese will claim that his language can't be considered Japanese at all. Think 'Finnegans Wake' and you will appreciate their perplexity. Given the difficulty of Dogen's language, and the profundity of his thought, it would seem to follow that only a lengthy immersion in, and deep pondering of, his text could result in an 'excellent' translation.If you run an Amazon search for 'Thomas Cleary,' it will produce over 140 items. Now then, I could be wrong, but given the sheer massiveness of Cleary's output, one suspects a preference for quantity over quality, particularly if one considers that just one of these items is the incredibly long 1643-page 'Flower Ornament Scripture,' a translation that could have taken a 'lesser' man ten or more years.I know that there are some good things in Cleary's edition, because I used to have the book. But before deciding, readers might care to look at the Dogen translations of Francis H. Cook - 'How to Raise an Ox' and 'Sounds of Valley Streams.' Cook's output, numerically, is nowhere near as impressive as that of Cleary, but in addition to being a Zen adept his scholarship is impeccable, and some readers may find his readings more to their taste.Personally, I think it would be very hard to better Cook's translation of the 'Shobogenzo genjokoan,' of which the following is a brief extract:&quot;Conveying the self to the myriad beings to authenticate them is delusion; the myriad things advancing to authenticate the self is enlightenment&quot; [Sounds of Valley Streams, page 66].But whether you plump for Cleary, or Cook, or other translators such as Kazuaki Tanahashi or Gudo Nishijima, you should certainly get hold of somebody's reading of Dogen. You'll be impressed. He leaves most other thinkers behind in the dust."},{"Title":"Shobogenzo: v. 2: Zen Essays - The Eye and Treasury of the True Law","review":"Thomas Cleary has translated 13 of the 95 chapters of Dogens masterpiece, Shobogenzo, in this wonderful book. Besides the general introduction at the beginning of the book, he provides a modest but succinct introduction to each chapter, and footnotes at the end of each chapter. He has chosen 13 of the best chapters, including such classics as Genjokoan, and Uji. The only flaw is the fact that there now remain 82 chapters that must be read either in Japanese or by often less qualified translators. (Cleary has translated a couple other chapters in \\"Rational Zen\\", now out of print.)Anyone interested in Dogen will be happy to read and re-read this powerful collection of his writings. Tom, if you're listening, more, more..."},{"Title":"Shobogenzo: v. 2: Zen Essays - The Eye and Treasury of the True Law","review":"Your options for studying Dogen's thought are few. I believe that this collection of essays compiled by Mr. Cleary is an excellent one. This work contains a much smaller number of essays than that of the actual Shobogenzo. I think that Mr. Cleary has done a good job with his selection of essays for this book. This book offers the reader a very nice cross section from the whole of the original work. I like his translations and his introductions before each essay are helpful.Other options would be;a translation of the \\"The Shobogenzo\\" by Nishijima Roshi and Cross. This four book set includes all of Master Dogen's 95 essays that make up the whole of The Shobogenzo. This is a wonderful resource for those looking to really dig into Master Dogen's Dharma.Also, Rev. Shohaku Okumura of the Sanhin Zen Community is working on translating much of Master Dogen's writings and talks. Many of which are available.Finally, I feel that if you are to truly to see what Master Dogen's is pointing to in his Shobogenzo you will need to have a solid foundation in a correct daily Zazen practice. The insight resulting from your efforts is the tool needed to clarify or even just to penetrate Master Dogens work.One final thought, for those looking for a great book that is a \\"how to\\" of Zen practice, \\"The Three Pillars of Zen\\" by the late Phillip Kapleau has been a huge help to many.Best Wishes."},{"Title":"Shobogenzo: v. 2: Zen Essays - The Eye and Treasury of the True Law","review":"A useful &quot;best of&quot; selection of Dogen's enormous masterwork. Cleary is generally dependable in this venture. While not as comprehensive as &quot;Moon in a Dewdrop&quot;, the book has the virtue of fitting very neatly into a backpack. As 'wisdom imparts wisdom to wisdom', highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shobogenzo: v. 2: Zen Essays - The Eye and Treasury of the True Law","review":"For casual or beginning students, a very useful, selected 'best of', summary type of collection. Cleary appears dependable in this venture. Moon in a Dewdrop is more complete, but does not fit in the backpack nearly as well."},{"Title":"Shobogenzo: v. 2: Zen Essays - The Eye and Treasury of the True Law","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, these translations are good-yet not as to the point as \\"Moon in a Dewdrop.\\" For those of you unfamiliar with the book we are mentioning, I recommend purchasing it before this one. The reviewer prior to him mentioned Cook's translation of the Genjokoan, a text which some 20 years after Shobogenzo's completion was made the first chapter. Personally, not to play one-upmanship here, I find Taizan Maezumi Roshi's commentaries on Genjokoan as erudite as the original work itself. I recommend grabbing \\"The Teachings of the Great Mountain: Zen Talks by Taizan Maezumi.\\" Very clear text it is. All in all this is a pretty good translation, while there are better out there frankly. The one I mentioned starting the review is the best I've found in the form of \\"best of\\" in terms of Dogen's work and even poetry. So buy this book to expand your horizons, and yes even learn some things. But be sure to continue your quest in understanding Dogen's crucial Zen more and more, because this isn't the best book out there on the subject. Having said all this, I think you'll really enjoy it. Take care!"},{"Title":"A Kipling Pageant","review":"This is probably the best single-volume collection of Kipling's work. The Viking Portable Library collection excludes some of his most important stories and poems. This volume has a better selection of his early work -- although Kipling was so prolific that a second large volume of his best could easily be compiled. This book however excludes some his cryptic and difficult later stories such as \\"Dayspring Mishandled\\" which were little noted in their day.The master himself wrote the introduction to \\"A Kipling Pageant\\" in 1935 not long before his death and the essay is a priceless example of Kipling's imagination at work. Among the essential reading in this book I would list the following stories: Lispeth, The Man Who Would Be King, Without Benefit of Clergy, Mowgli's Brothers, Rikki-tikki-tavi\\" and \\"The Church That Was at Antioch.\\" The best poems include \\"If, Recessional, Mandalay, Gunga Din,\\" and \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy.\\" An essay, \\"An Interview with Mark Twain\\" is excellent. However, don't bother to read the novel included in this book, \\"A Light that Failed\\" unless you're really addicted to Kipling. Kipling was not a novelist -- except for \\"Kim\\" which is wonderfully atmospheric, although uneven.Kipling got a bad rap as a racist and conservative among his contemporaries. Actually, he had more sympathy with the subjects of British Imperialism than did many of his critics -- and vastly more understanding. What made Kipling great as an artist was an imagination so expansive that he could imagine himself as the ruler of a country in the future, the engine of a ship, a boy lost in the jungle, a Cockney soldier, an early Christian missionary, or an old woman looking back on life.Kipling and Somerset Maugham in my opinion are the best writers of short stories in English. Kipling, in addition, is one of the most quotable of poets. \\"On the road to Mandalay, Where the flyin'-fishes play, An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!\\"Smallchief"},{"Title":"Thumbs Up Australia: Hitching the Outback","review":"I very much enjoyed this novel and found it to be a real page-turner in that it was a tale of endeavour and continually emergent experiences. This novel touched on an area most Australian's seem to be little aware of and seem themselves to experience almost as a foreign country most notably the centre and north of this massive country/continent. Indeed an area that most of us won't experience whilst traversing the urban parts so well advertised by the brochures. As such I found it a fascinating contrast from that given by the rather conservative and urbanised travelogues I'd read on this country by Bill Bryson's \`Down Under' although in itself an interesting travelogue. Bill Bryson's travelogue was the last book I bought for my brother when he left for Australia three years ago, this will be my next one."},{"Title":"Thumbs Up Australia: Hitching the Outback","review":"If you have a sense of adventure, grab a copy of this book.

Bravo, Hugo!When I get back from Tunesia, I'm going to brush up on my command of German with your colloquial German cassette/book course..."},{"Title":"Hugo Language Course: Arabic In Three Months (with Cassettes)","review":"First off, I am a student of Arabic and have been studying both Modern Standard Arabic (fusHa) and Levantine Colloquial Arabic ('amiyyeh) for awhile. Additionally, I am Palestinian, so I'm quite familiar with what is and isn't suitable for the real world.Most Arabic books are terrible, terrible books. The problems are numerous, including: teaching you the rather user-unfriendly writing system in the first chapter and writing in Arabic script after that, having script that's way too tiny, leaving out diacritics that are vital for learners, teaching you tourist phrases in incorrect Arabic and other such things, leaving out grammar or using way too much grammatical jargon that you can't make any sense of it....This book is different. When I found this book, I looked through it and instantly noticed that it teaches spoken Arabic that was very familiar to me - this is the same Arabic I hear spoken in my house! (The author is Jordanian; the dialect taught by this book is used mostly in Palestine, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.) I was very surprised, as no other book I had come across taught the spoken Arabic that is /actually used/ in Arab homes and businesses.Other reviews were disappointed because of the use of the transliteration system and the complete absence of Arabic script. One must understand that colloquial Arabic and modern standard Arabic are quite different. The former is what you speak, the latter is what you read with and give speeches with. Colloquial Arabic /is not written./ Thus, one shouldn't expect a colloquial Arabic book to use Arabic script. I found that the transliteration system was the clearest one I have come across yet AND that it really facilitates learning.Also of vital importance is that this book explains grammar in a lucid way instead of getting bogged down in jargon, as most other books do. There are very, very few resources for people wanting to learn the nuts and bolts of colloquial Arabic and this book does an excellent job of it.I very highly recommend this book.Note: As I said, this book teaches the dialects used in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan. Arabic dialects do differ in varying amounts from each other. If you use this book with the intention of using it in Egypt, it will work well enough; if you read this book and then go to Morocco or Algeria, it will be essentially useless. Do your research on dialect differences."},{"Title":"Hugo Language Course: Arabic In Three Months (with Cassettes)","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I bought this book and therefore would not suggest it to anyone. I had previously studied some Classical Arabic and I desired to brush up on my knowledge especially in regards to speaking. Unfortunately, this book only uses a transliteration system. Therefore, it becomes difficult (or at the very least a big headache) to match the words and phrases taught with standard written Classical Arabic. Admittedly, the point of the course is to teach spoken Arabic and not written Arabic, but I think it would be useful for the student to see the written Arabic alongside the transliterated text. However, I do not believe that this work would be useful for an absolute beginner either. Since the book uses its own transliteration system and not an international linguistic system, the student will not be able to progress beyond this course should he or she ever finish it. Finally, I found the vocabulary and the phrases to be very random. There were very few recorded conversations, which I thought was strange considering it is trying to teach conversational Arabic. Furthermore, I found the tapes rather hard to follow and not well done. Usually, the books and tapes of the Hugo Language series are very well done, however, this one seems to be a very bad exception. I would recommend instead the &quot;Teach yourself Arabic&quot; book and tapes by Jack Smart and Frances Altorfer. While not perfect, it is a much better system."},{"Title":"Hugo Language Course: Arabic In Three Months (with Cassettes)","review":"This book throws random words and phrases at you without building up any sort of consistent vocabulary or grammer.

It is one of the the top two or three book s on the subject and as such, is easy to recommend. BUT, be very careful of most example scripts. Many have syntax errors (which is strange , given they are clearly 'cut and paste' from a screen dump). If you are an experienced DBA, you will spot them on reading. At worst they will be obvious when they generate an error. However for the less experienced, there could be some frustrating moments. This is very disappointing for the second edition of a book (some of the grammar leaves alot to be desired too!). Also on the downside, the book claims to include updates for Oracle 8, but this is a rather generous claim, Many examples or recommendations are redundant in an Oracle 8 environment but are not identified as such. Overall though, still a worthwhile part of any DBA's toolkit."},{"Title":"Oracle Performance Tuning (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"To say this book is only about 'Performance Tuning' would be like saying 'The Complete Works of Shakespeare' were only about Elizabethan England.

But that good schema looks very confuse when the author starts to make suggestions or tips that aren't sorted by any kind of category (and they often takes a lot of pages)... Those comments are very good, so it needs a bit of more organization.I recommend this book for instance and database tuning, but not for SQL tuning (the author has another excellent book on this subject).

At the same time, it does not covers statspack or AWR (only basic utlbstats/utlestat). Working with Oracle for the last 20+ years, I found Oracle statspack and AWR irreplaceable analysis tools. These tools actually enable DBAs to quantify performance impact of the bottlenecks and clearly see root causes of performance degradation. This is especially important for analysis of oracle RAC systems, as quite frequently, activity on one of the instances negatively impacts other RAC nodes or even causing instance eviction.I have tried number of tools to analyze AWR and statspack data, including native Oracle EM (Enterprise manager). So far, I have found that Enteros' Performance Explorer-i (from [...]) provides best and state of the art performance analysis capabilities for statspack and AWR data. Usually, work of hours with AWR or statspack reports is compressed into minutes by using proprietary Enteros' spike analysis, that analyses hundreds of metrics together and provide clear picture of performance bottleneck development and correlations. Performance Explorer-i also enable me to perform automatic cross-instance analysis for RAC instances, which is extremely important for resolution of complext issues.Also, many DBA not changing standard collection period and retention of AWR snapshots (1 hour and 7 days).

It's rare to find a book that combines the fast read enjoyment of a Stephen King novel with some depth of thought. Imagine, an intelligent fantasy?! Jack Cassidy (Saint Jack) is a NYC firefighter who loses his own family in a tragic fire. He's so distraught he wants to kill himself but is kept from doing it by the sudden appearance of a vision that tells him he must live in order to save the world from a growing threatening evil. This he agrees to do and so his adventures begin. Along the way he's helped by a pair of angels (who appear to him in the form of rats in his basement) and by a talisman that grants him great powers (invisibility, etc.) All of this is wonderfully written with a good deal of imagery. In each scene the reader feels like he/she is right there. And the book gives you plenty to think about after you put it down. Apocalypse soon? Maybe, and it might be us humans who bring it down upon ourselves. Scary."},{"Title":"Saint Jack and Toad: Third Angel of the Apocalypse","review":"\\"Saint Jack\\" is a great urban fantasy but the other published book is superior to this edition.

Set in modern-day New York City, it reads like a suspense tale but contains touches of fantasy, and is as realistically gritty at times as the backstreets and alleyways of New York's rougher neighborhoods...(A) stirring tale but...also storytelling with intelligence and social consciousness (increasingly rare) that allows the book to transcend the limits of a \\"genre\\" novel.Jack Cassidy (the \\"Saint Jack\\" of the title) is a New York City firefighter. The book opens with a vivid scene in which Jack is attempting to rescue a young child from a raging fire:\\"And he'd better find her fast! Heat! He could feel the beast nearby,its vast appetite for destruction coming closer. The fire scared him but it was the heavy smoke that made him fear for the child's life at the moment. Nine times out of ten it was the fire's breath and not the fire that killed. Is the girl still alive? Maybe not. Not in this...Smoke concealed everything. The fire began to perform for him, presenting him with spirals of flame curling along the ceiling. Chilling grins of flame which his sight could discern despite the billowing fog.\\"Jack does save the young girl and then, in perverse irony, that same night, driving home, he is shocked to discover that his own house is ablaze, and that within that blaze are the cremated bodies of his own wife and child.(The novel) is a love story as well, for Jack never fully recovers from the loss of his wife and daughter. His love is too great. A short while after their deaths, he walks to their graves with the intent of killing himself. He is stopped...by the sudden appearance of a holy vision, a Lady, who tells him he must live in order to save humankind from a growing evil that would summon the \\"Third Angel of the Apocalypse\\" and destroy the world....Most of the action takes place on the streets of New York City's coarse Lower East Side...The novel is filled with characters from those hostile streets, prostitutes, pimps, youth gangs, professional gangsters and runaway teens. This is a novel as gritty and New York City streetwise as it is philosophical and thought provoking......The \\"Toad\\" of the title is a runaway boy who lives by his wits and by street-performing his magic tricks for donations on the sidewalks of New York City. He and another recent runaway, Susan, are thrown inadvertantly into the path of the evil that Jack is seeking to find and destroy. Susan, who ran away from the threat of molestation by her stepfather, now has her life threatened by circumstance and Toad and Jack must risk their own lives to try to save her....fast paced action, a novel of faith and redemption, of good versus evil,an adventure-filled tale that stretches out to explore the nature of things, of greed and even of God...There is much magic in this book, not the least of which is Carraher's superior prose......

It was presented to me as a highly recommended twist and turn for contemporary suspense and adventure - and it is. It's a different type of story. One that strikes you as odd at first and then runs into a direction I never expected. I eased through the story with a quick eye and relished at the verve and style of the writer. Not a bad piece of work and worth a read, especially when the story begins to roll. The beginning, I will say, sort of lingered for me (it stretched for a moment) - but then everything peaked into high gear like a tsunami. My favorite scene (don't worry - no spoilers) occurs during midday or so, and there is someone on a rooftop, along with money and a rifle. That was very well written.There are more great scenes in this book - and Jack (the main) has some of the best movie-like moments that are so picturesque, and visual, it adds to the cool of the book. In a nutshell, the book is AWESOME. It was a nice change of pace from my typical musings. I am only giving this book four stars because I caught something that the editor missed - but I am forgiving - the story still has impact. The story is an odyssey and fun and surprising. I also give it a four because I think that I would love to know more about Cimmerian Farms - but I should give it a five for the nice touch with a character named Piejak!

He is so distraught that he goes to the family grave to kill himself, to put a bullet in his head. But he's stopped by a vision, a Lady in Blue Light, who tells Jack he must live so as to fight a gathering and growing evil occurring in the world. Jack accepts the Lady's words. But what is that evil? How is he to find it? A dream tells Jack where to start, telling him to go back to where he grew up, back to the mean streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side. Amongst the sinners there, he will find the one great sin he seeks. It's here, amongst the pimps and prostitutes, thieves and downtrodden souls, (some of whom he helps)that he gains his nickname: &quot;Saint Jack&quot;.Toad is a runaway boy, surviving through his wits and his talents as a street entertainer. A boy &quot;dressed in the Armor of Avoid&quot; as he trusts no one and is friends with few. But he meets another runaway, a girl Susan who has fled abuse at her home, and he befriends her. The two young souls huddle together in a sense, surviving the potentially cruel streets of the big city. The evil Jack seeks eventually swirls about Susan, threatening her life, and so it is that Saint Jack and Toad are pushed together by circumstances, by the touch of an evil that affects them both. Jack is pledged to destroy it while Toad seeks to rescue the friend he's grown to love from it. Jack has help in his mission, he's not alone in his fight. He's been granted the friendship of a pair of protecting angels as well as the gift of an ancient talisman with great powers. He'll need all the help he can get for the evil Jack seeks to destroy has its defenders as well, that of the very powers of Hell, which powers want to see this evil succeed in this world. Jack is a warrior standing in the middle, a fighter between the forces of good and evil. This is a superior, intelligent, imaginative book with wonderful writing which is rare today. A book worth reading many times."},{"Title":"Saint Jack and Toad: Third Angel of the Apocalypse","review":"This is an intelligent and humane book and, in an odd way, sentimental. There is an underlying sweetness in this book (if one can use that term when speaking of a gritty urban novel that takes place in large part on New York City's &quot;mean streets&quot;). Perhaps that sweetness exists because love is so prominent in the novel. Much of the actions of the two main characters (the fireman Jack and the runaway boy, Toad)are motivated by love, by Jack's love for his family (now lost) and Toad's for Susan, a runaway girl.After reading the book I found I was as interested in some of the underlying themes as I was in the main story itself. There's a lot of &quot;food for thought&quot; in this book.There is the event Jack experiences when he first goes out with the super powerful crystal he took off a dead man's bones, a corpse that he dug up in the basement of his brownstone. It is a stone that has the ability to grant the wearer many powers. And it offers Jack one such power immediately as he is suddenly seeing people as the &quot;angels see&quot; them. That is, he sees the souls of the people he passes on the street walking side by side with their physical bodies, and he is shocked to horror by what he sees in many (not all)of the people passing by. This struck me as an enhancement of the Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme. Here the good side of people(presented for public consumption) exists side by side with the evil side, with the evil being hidden underneath. Hidden from the sight of other people but on grotesque display for God and the angles to see. Jack, after experiencing the &quot;truth&quot; about people, is frightened of what he might see if he looked in the mirror and saw his own hidden self. Is he like the others?This same theme is repeated later in a sequence in which Jack meets &quot;Truth&quot; (an anemic Truth) and she tells him one truth in particular, that all of society is based upon humans learning to hide what they truly are, both from others and from themselves. A point which is worth contemplating.Here, the author is not talking of a single man (Dr. Jekyll) with a dark secret of evil, but of many of us in society, many with our souls scarred and gone to rot by what we secretly choose to do.Another of this book's themes is the DNA experimentation that is taking place in this book (and in real life). Is it possible that we humans are in fact, tinkering with the &quot;Waters of Life&quot;? I.e., the natural &quot;order&quot; of DNA. Will we, in the name of science, ultimately produce a destructive force that will threaten all of us? The more I read in newspapers the more I think it's possible.And the means by which this experimentation takes place (in this book) is quite terrifying when one thinks about it. Young runaway children are kidnapped off the streets to be used in labs for scientific purposes. Could that be happening now, in real life? God forbid, but there are a lot of youngsters missing every year, aren't there?In real life, scientists are splicing jellyfish genes into mice, so that the mice glow green, for goodness sake. Who knows what else is being done that doesn't make it into the news? And what if one of these experiments escapes from a lab (as some movies would have it) and begins to corrupt the DNA of the world itself?It is only when going back and contemplating the novel's underlying themes that one realizes what a harsh indictment the book is actually giving us, against the nature of people (with their hidden sins)and against the many current ills that permeate the societies (even the best of them) of our world.There are other themes worth discussing in this rich and layered book but it would take too many pages to write of them here. This is a book that is great fun to read and, perversely, a bit disturbing to think about."},{"Title":"Saint Jack and Toad: Third Angel of the Apocalypse","review":"I loved this book.

Best I've read in years."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"I've read many bad computer books and this one is less then horrible, but it sure ain't good.The authors start with a very important forward pointing out that most books and courses in C++ and Java make the mistake of covering basic implementation of the language without employing object orientated techniques. Then, when object orientated programming style is introduced, students are bound to be frustrated and confused. This is a correct description of a serious problem that university's need to address. However this book goes too far in the other direction. The authors take an extreme Ivory tower approach. They expound eloquently on program specifications and design philosophy while ignoring the implementation, which is half the battle. Explanations related to programming become meaningless unless there is good code to edify the ideas they are trying to convey. This book has very little good code in it that you can employ in a useful and instructive manner. Related to this overly object orientated Ivory tower teaching approach some major problems with this book are:IO streams are not even covered until the end of the book. I suppose the author's de-emphasis of realistic programming problems relates to their desire to teach beautifully rather then practiaclly.A continual stream of program methods are thrown about in later chapters which are not appropriate to a CS 101 level courseJava language conventions and fundamentals are given swift and inadequate treatment in first three chapter (except for objects which are covered well).Very few compact code examples to illustrate basic and intermediate programming concepts.No answers to programming exercises at the end of chapters.The worst thing is the stupid D&amp;D program that they use for half the book to demonstrate too many concepts. Who in Tar-nation is going to be able to figure out what the heck is going on with a program this advanced by the time its dragged through the sixth chapter? It's a forty method, multi-class implementation! Please. How are you going to learn basic Java concepts from a program that takes up 40 pages? If you can emulate what the heck their doing with this program at that point then you should be teaching the class not taking it."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"I've been a designer/multimedia developer for the past 10 years (using Director/Lingo and Dreamweaver/HTML and After Effects). Until recently, I'd been sorely underdeveloped in the areas of scripting and application customization (not to mention application development) since I had only a very basic understanding of programming concepts and tended to use &quot;black box&quot; code off the web, which I'd modify to suit my purposes. I'd studied Java at Career Centers (a NYC-based training facility) but although I had learned the syntax and general usage, I was missing a foundation in the underlying programming concepts...A month ago I decided to buckle down and learn core programming techniques. I found this book, and it has served me WELL. (Paid $40 for a used copy).I'm not sure how frustrating this book would be to someone who had never seen Java before, or had little knowledge of the scope of the language. However, if you're a &quot;scrip kiddie&quot; or a developer with a &quot;working knowledge&quot; of programming tools, but no thorough understanding of core techniques -- this book is for you!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"If you already know quite a little about Java (I mean, you have finished reading at least one whole book about Java basics), maybe this is a good book to explore the OO aspects of Java. But this book is definitely NOT for the beginners. It is crazy to use it as a textbook in an intro CS class. If you happen to be a self-study guy, it would be a nightmare."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"My business card says &quot;software engineer&quot; but I code very little. This book is the text for an introductory computer science course I am taking. While I admire the authors' attempt at putting Objects First in the curriculum, they have only succeeded in confusing and alienating a number of my classmates with little programming experience. The most glaring weaknesses are the the relatively few, undistinguished examples, and the lack of rigor in teaching Java syntax and semantics. The authors' freely admit that they do not attempt to teach Java itself, but this ultimately leaves students stranded as they peruse the hundreds of Java titles at the local bookstore, looking for a decent language reference. Lastly, they mix a lot of software engineering practice in with the actual computer science. While topics such as programming by contract and software quality are important, I am not convinced that this material is suited for students at the beginning level."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"I'm unfortunate enough to use this book for my object-oriented software design class. The text is very complicated and very difficult to understand. Plus, there is not a whole lot of examples provided in the book. The problems on the back of each chapter make you more confused rather than increase your understanding. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"This book, in my opinion, is probably one of the few better introduction books that should be widely used in many intro computer courses. I have programmed for many years, and I have learned that I have made the same mistake in the past that I know many others have done, when they first started programming. The problem I am talking about is when some people program, they just go up to the keyboard and screen and just type, which I have learned from this book that it is very wrong to do. I have learned from this book that when one programs, he/she has to have some kind of design implementation (UML) set and ready before going to turn the designs to code. As an introductory book, this will teach beginner programmers the correct way to program, without the sloppy coding techniques.The first two chapters are a good explanation to how computers process code and the meaning of object-orientation. The next couple of chapters gives a brief overview of what Java is and how Java ties in with object-oriented design. If one already has Java experience, I think he/she can just skip these chapters, because it may get repetitive to the eyes. For beginner Java-ers, the book gives excellent pure examples in Java, without any confusing documentation or coding.Then comes Chapter 10 and on... These chapters covered are for Java programmers who have already passed the Beginner's stage, but feel they need to 'dip their feet' in Java water a little more before declaring themselves as proficient Java-ers. These chapters cover excellent computer terminology and basic computer aspects (lists, sorts, searches, abstractions) and classic algorithmic ideas. The last couple of chapters deal with introduction to Exceptions (Java) and GUI Applets, after dealing with TUI most of the book.So in closing, a good book for introduction, but if you do have experience in Java, then you still would find the book useful, with a handful of excellent defined computer programming terminology and examples. Also, I took the class with one of the authors (Dr. Jaime Nino) and he is truly an exceptional professor at heart who loves his programming."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"For nearly two decades, the computer science department at the University of New Orleans has had the outstanding reputation of possessing one of the finest academic programs in software engineering in the south. A huge part of this reputation can be attributed to the presence of two legendary software designers at the department, Professor Fred Hosch and Professor Jaime Nino. Now, for the benefit of those who are unable to experience the expertise of these two professors first-hand, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. proudly presents An Introduction to Software Construction with Java, the very first textual authority ever to be written by Professors Hosch and Nino. Although no substitution for the professors themselves, this paperback mentor will teach you how to program and program well.Unlike any other textual teaching tools on the subject of software construction today, such as Java In a Nutshell by David Flanagan, Hosch and Nino's text is geared towards the novice programmer, that is, an introductory-level student who does not even know the meaning of the phrase &quot;computer science.&quot; In this textbook, the authors first define what it means to be a software engineer. Then, they will take you by the hand and teach you the basic syntax and grammar of the Java language. You will learn how to define variables and construct objects. You will know what the concept of &quot;object-oriented designing&quot; means.Next, these authors will teach you what no other books on software that I have read thus far will teach you: how to design a good software system. These authors will teach you how to construct interaction diagrams and how to use them so that you can implement well-organized relationships between clients and servers. You will fully understand and appreciate the extremely important, yet often overlooked, concept of designing a good programming by contract relationship between objects. Often, I see textbooks presenting as examples to students implementations that Hosch and Nino would refer to as a &quot;house of cards.&quot; In other words, the relationships between the objects in such examples are so unnecessarily complex that any minute modifications to these poor implementations will cause the collapse of their entire software structure.A programmer, by definition, is one who can implement software systems that execute properly. What, then, is the definition of a good programmer? A good programmer is one who knows how to implement software so that it can solve a problem within the least amount of time possible. How do you gauge the time complexity of a software system? Hosch and Nino will present you with a classical tool for measuring software speed that is guaranteed to increase the efficiency of your designs in no time.Other topics covered in this book include: constructing lists, guidelines to writing better comments and documentations, techniques for building maintainable and adaptive software that completely encapsulates a single notion, techniques for optimizing your software's interface via the principle of information hiding, handling exceptions and failures, developing graphical user interfaces that adhere to the model-view-controller pattern, constructing advanced containers, such as dynamic arrays, linked lists, stacks, dictionaries, queues, and hash tables, and, finally, learning how to develop your very own software library.So, if you are a software developer or are just remotely interested in the craft of software engineering, I urge you to buy this book and let Hosch and Nino, two legendary professors from the University of New Orleans, teach you the proper marksmanship of legendary programming."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using Java","review":"The book is really heavy and big,and it arrive before due date.The book is perfact except some little problem,for example,the CD with the book can not work."},{"Title":"The provinces of the Roman empire from Caesar to Diocletian,","review":"While the author's admiration for what he calls &quot;the Latin-Greek civilizing process&quot;is unquestionable, his exploration of how the widening circle of Roman influence sustained itself is handled with systematic scrupulousness. Mommsen describes Rome's acquisition and ultimate control of Gaul, Spain, Britain, the Danubian lands, as well as Greece and Asia Minor. He then discusses at equal length Rome's difficult dominion in Egypt, Judaea, Syria, the North African territories, and the frontiers along the Euphrates.The Provinces of the Roman Empire was originally published as two volumes in Mommen's magnificent multivolume History of Rome, a life's work that contributed to his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1902. (The award was given for Mommen's eloquent style-the work itself is first-rate historical scholarship.) That Mommsen structured these two volumes as a work that could stand alone within his larger istory is made clar in his introduction, and has been affirmed by later historians."},{"Title":"The provinces of the Roman empire from Caesar to Diocletian,","review":"Theodore Mommsen's Provinces of the Roman Empire will provide an indescribable wealth of material for readers concerned with Rome's military history, expansion and growth, from Caesar to Diocletian. While this book lacks the eloquence and depth of Gibbon, and reads more like reference material than pure history, it still must be regarded as the foremost authority upon the subjects it covers. The only real negative about this immense work is the fact that rarely is anything said about culture. Its hard to believe that a book illuminating the history of the provinces has almost entirely overlooked the cultural impact Rome had on the provinces and likewise that the provinces had on Rome."},{"Title":"The provinces of the Roman empire from Caesar to Diocletian,","review":"Provinces of the Roman Empire gets a bit slow at times, and that is understandable since it is a compiled two volume book on the history of those important provinces of Rome and their contributions to the empire. I agree with the reviewer who said there was not enough culture. After pages upon pages about inscriptions, coins, wars, and revolts it would have been nice to have at least more than a paragraph or two on the native religion and the culture of the people before the hellenization. The best section for me was that dealing with Judea. Since the Jewish religion is so intertwined with the Hebrew state, then Mommsen was forced to include more information of the culture of the populace than what he devotes in the other sections. I'm not qualified to judge this book on its merit as a historical reference, but I have come away from reading it with more information about the lands that were subject to Rome. If you have a thirst for Roman history, then by all means read this book, just don't expect a great deal of information about cultural issues."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2000 Design & T-SQL Programming","review":"This book is OK, but gives the impression that you will learn how to design a SQL Server 2000 database, not as an academic computer science exercise, but for what I need it for - work!There's only 4 chapters on the design, not nearly enough information on normalization, and the remainder of the book - using SQL Server 2000 - was covered far more comprehensively in Rob Veera's book from Wrox Press.In short, OK for a complete beginner but not nearly enough meat for those who need to know this information on a daily basis."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2000 Design & T-SQL Programming","review":"Headaches..Headaches..Headaches..I personally go through a lot of technical books. This one is a nightmare. If you like to read books that are just get to the point, then this book is not for you. The writing style so horrible that I have to take a break on almost every 3-4 pages. This book claimed that it is for all level. However, I honestly don't think this book is for a beginner person. If you are looking for an entry-level book on the SQL 2000, I would recommend &quot;SQL Server 2000 Programming&quot; from Wrox."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2000 Design & T-SQL Programming","review":"This book has been specifically written for database administrators, designers or programmers who want to know more about logic behind SQL2000 GUI. This book also can be a significant step to understand T-SQL and database design and implementations. In particular for someone preparing for the MS certification exam on SQL7 or 2000 DB implementation, this book should be the first to start. After reading this book you should be well advanced in using not only proper T-SQL syntax but also understand execution plans in Query Analyzer. This book can give you a fresh view to understand how to design and write to get optimum from SQL Server. Final words in my review: this book is rather not for beginners but can give you info on SQL real world challenges."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2000 Design & T-SQL Programming","review":"I have been using this book for four years now. I used it yesterday to look up the syntax for the CONVERT statement in relation to date/time formatting, for use in a SQL 2005 stored procedure. I could say more, but chances are that if you are reading this, you should get it anyway.I predict this book will be used for years to come because SQL 2000 is the heart of many DB systems."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2000 Design & T-SQL Programming","review":"It is really sad that a serious piece of work like this book doesn't get the deserved appreciation. Five years ago, I started my first steps with SQL-Server 2000 using this book and I admire it deeply and I am very thankful for the authors' efforts. It is true I had to scratch my head 10 times an hour, but this had nothing to do with the writing style, the book is full of information, ideas, design guide lines and I had to keep up.While reading this book, you will never hear the angry voice in your head saying \\"Get to the point\\" or \\"What is the God d.... point\\". You are not going to cry as a lousy sense of humor's side effect.You also are not going to be insulted by pre made assumption that you are duh and you have to be instructed, in killing details, how to tie your shoes. Unlike some other red books writers, the authors didn't care about inflating the page count to justify an over priced, few pounds of blah, blah and more blah.I read this book cover to cover, more than once, and I assure you this is the book you want to read if you want to get the most for your time. Just be aware that the authors neither treat you as a baby nor are willing to tell you any bed time stories. The book has a scientific writing style, words and paragraphs were chosen carefully and meticulously to strike the point at heart, nonsense was cut down to zero.We all know that design is the art of balancing trade offs. The authors didn't save any efforts making you fully aware of your options explaining in details the when(s) why(s) and how(s) to, or not to, apply them based on an educated decision not a good luck wish.Don't take my word for it, grab the book and read any chapter, CH16 Indexes or CH18 Triggers for example and then compare by reading the same chapters in Professional SQL-Server (Wrox) which is amazingly overrated compared to this book which is amazingly underrated. You will see the differences immediately.If the book claimed to be \\"Professional Blah,...\\", I would take one star out for not covering some important subjects (the details of using Index Tuning Wizard for example) in more detailed way (the same subject is not covered in Wrox's Professional SQL-Server either)."},{"Title":"War Pilot of Orange: Dutch Fighter Pilot WW II","review":"This book presents the Great Escape from a Dutch perspective. Bob Vanderstok (Brahm van der Stok), the author, was only one of three of the 76 escapees who made it to freedom. Fifty of the 73 recaptured airmen were shot by the Germans in flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention.The book begins with description of Vanderstok's experiences in the Dutch Air Force and then the RAF. His descriptions and photos of the German conquest of the Netherlands are graphic. When later a POW, Vanderstok hears the Germans whining about the Allied bombings of German cities, to which he replies by recounting the deaths and destruction of Warsaw, Rotterdam, and other cities by the German Luftwaffe.Vanderstok elaborates on some events that stand out in the film on the Great Escape. There is the \\"wire happy\\" Irishman (not Scot) who flagrantly climbed the wire and got shot. There is a description of the shootout between the French Underground and the Germans at the time that he was being escorted through southern France. Vanderstok contends that tunnel Harry came up short of the woods not owing to an erroneous measurement of the tunnel length, nor an error in estimating the distance to the woods, but because there was a slight error in the direction of its excavation.Vanderstok presents some information not found in other books on Stalag Luft III. For instance, there is an account of an escape attempt using a hot air balloon. It had to be abandoned because there was no way of concealing the homemade balloon before it was ready for action. There is also an account of a small escape being covered up, during the appel (counting parade), by mannequins dressed as the missing men. It almost worked.Unfortunately, there are a number of factual errors in the book which require correction. The tunnel found by the Germans was Tom, not Dick. The head of the tailor department at Stalag Luft III was Tommy Guest, not Pawel Tobolski. The designers of the traps of the three tunnels had been Polish engineers, not Czechs. The designers of the air-bellow pumps for the tunnels had been a Norwegian, not a Czech.Escaping from a POW camp is only half the battle. Following the Great Escape itself, Vanderstok had a long way to go to freedom. Much detail is given about Vanderstok's surreptitious travels across Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, and Gibraltar. After arriving in Bristol, England, he resumed his duties as a combat pilot. He fought until the surrender of Germany. He also reports postwar incidents of German snipers shooting at the Allies, and setting up wires to behead unsuspecting Army motorcyclists.After the war, Vanderstok became a doctor and eventually emigrated to the US. Vanderstok also describes postwar reunions of erstwhile POWs and German guards. Moroever, his book includes photos of many of the locations (in Belgium, southern France, the Pyrenees Mountains, Spain itself) involved in his trek across German-occupied Europe in 1944, and which he revisited and photographed in 1986."},{"Title":"War Pilot of Orange: Dutch Fighter Pilot WW II","review":"A dutch fighter pilot,from the 1939 German invasion :his escape from Stalag Luft III ...

This memoir delivers a vivid account of WWII in a way that is very real. So many of these types of books gloss over the horror and leave the reader with a rose colored synopsis of events. Not this one.It was painful to read what humans are capable of doing to each other but it is also heartening to know there are those like Dr. Vanderstok who will think not of their own safety but only that of doing what must be done. The courage of this one man should serve as a testament of the very best humanity has to offer.

What a treasure it is! It is a joy to behold, to browse, to read. The author's writing style is a bit ponderous, but that's acceptable in view of the wealth of information that he offers. The book does need updating: it's missing some information that I have in some other vexillology books (e.g., Znamierowski and Crampton) and contains a couple of subtle errors.

New countries have been born; old countries have changed (and sometimes rechanged) their flags.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jeeves and the Mating Season","review":"In a world sorely in need of a few good innocent laughs if not guffaws, there are always the Jeeves novels of P.G. Wodehouse. For those who spend too much time driving to read actual books, many of them are now on audio tape under the Audio Partners label and the latest of them is &quot;Jeeves and the Mating Season&quot; (61318), complete and unabridged. (Is that last phrase a tautology?)I have reviewed so many of these Jeeves books that I can only say they take place in a mythical time between the world wars when featherbrains like Bertie Wooster cannot survive without clever man servants like his Jeeves. Always intending the best and always creating the worst until Jeeves pulls him out of it, Bertie tries very hard to live up to the Code of the Woosters, a long list of chivalric ideals, one of which is that if a woman is convinced you want to marry her, marry her you must. So to avoid walking down the aisle with the most bubbleheaded female of them all, Bertie must make sure her present affianced does not desert to the camp of a glamorous actress. And so on.To reveal more details can only diminish your enjoyment of this romp, but I can give the basic situation. Gussie Fink Nottle (lover of newts) is engaged to Madeline Bassett but falls into the clutches of Corky Pirbright who is engaged to Esmond Haddock (a man dominated by aunts) and whose dog has bitten Constable Dobbs who is in love with the maid and daughter of Jeeves' Uncle Charley who.... Well, you must by now know the Swiss clockwork plots of Wodehouse.Suffice it to say that Bertie has to pose as Gussie while a chap named Catsmeat poses as.... Again, I leave it to you to sort out.And always remember, it is not only the funny situations in the Jeeves novels but Bertie's (that is Wodehouse's) funny way in which they are told. I got a good loud laugh about once a page as read by the wonderful character actor Jonathan Cecil, the best of the readers in this series.There are six cassettes with a running time of just short of 7 hours. Very funny and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jeeves and the Mating Season","review":"Do yourself a big favor and disregard the ill tempered blighter that gave this CD a poor review because of Cecil's reading...he preferred Davidson. Amazing! Yawn.....Cecil is brilliant and far better in his interpretations than most others. A master of his art. A sensational deal too! Hear for yourself."},{"Title":"Jeeves and the Mating Season","review":"Jonathan Cecil isn't the best reader of this material. His Bertie is all right, but his Jeeves is all wrong. Cecil gives Jeeves an almost flamboyantly snooty accent that overplays the comedy and spoils the gentle irony of Jeeves' remarks. Also, the other male characters (besides Jeeves) sound too much like Bertie. Cecil also gives every line the same emphasis, as if he were putting an exclamation point at the end of every sentence, which becomes monotonous.My advice: avoid Cecil and go straight to the version read by Frederick Davidson. Davidson reads this delicate material with just the right feeling. He doesn't push the jokes too hard, and lets Wodehouse's beautifully bizarre phrases do their own work. His Bertie is somehow more &quot;real&quot; than that of Cecil, who sometimes seems to be reading his lines one word at a time from a distant cue card. Davidson's Jeeves is far superior as well--more reserved, and at the same time much funnier. And Davidson gives each of the characters a unique, interesting, but non-irritating voice--especially the aunts. His Aunt Dahlia (who appears in some of the other books, but not this one) is astonishingly good.I'll put it this way: if your favorite TV comedies have a laugh track, you'll probably prefer Cecil's reading. For a defter touch, I recommend Frederick Davidson."},{"Title":"Jeeves and the Mating Season","review":"We have sampled most of the narrations of Wodehouse's books over the years - from cast dramatisations from the BBC with Richard Briers to Jarvis to Jonathan Cecil and can tell you that Cecil comes out on top.I can comfortably tell you to ignore the blighter who most ill-advisedly recommends Jarvis over Cecil. Jonathan Cecil brings consistency and clarity to some incredibly convoluted passages, the voices and affectations are appropriate and help the narrative. Pure joy is the only way to describe our experience of Cecil's reading of Wodehouse.On my last rip to London, I picked up the remaining Wodehouse audiobooks narrated by Jonathan Cecil for our next long driving trip. One of joys was discovering that the U.K. release includes the narration of the preface/introduction written by P.G.

Spanning from the mid-1890s to 1945, this saga concerns the Hazeltines, who hold themselves aloof from the commonfolk in their small New England town. This isolation intensifies when Mr. Hazeltine, distraught over his fifth child's stillbirth and the failure of his horseless carriage business, commits suicide. Left behind is his fragile wife Olivia and their children: oldest child Francine, cold, sadistic Paul, and the two youngest, Margaret and Constance. As Olivia's mental state decreases(and her morphine use and drinking increases), Paul comes to dominate the household, cruelly lording his power over everyone, especially Francine, whom the adolescent Paul holds a most unnatural interest in. Fleeing this nightmare with a travelling peddlar, Francine makes her way to a big city, where she becomes swept up in the theater and becomes an actress of some reknown. Meanwhile, the years pass at the Hazeltine mansion, which has grown increasing decrepit. Olivia has died (and been deposited in the ice house by her thoughtful children)and Paul, Margaret, and Constance live like hermits. Still following their dead father's edict of non-fraternization with those that are \\"beneath\\" them, Paul, Margaret, and Constance take comfort only in (and with) each other, venturing forth occassionally to shop for groceries amid the sneers and whispers of the townspeople. But Francine has not forgotten her sisters. She promised them to come back, and she does. But the self-contained trio have some most unpleasant plans for her . . .Some might compare this gothic sleazefest with V.C. Andrews' books, in a roundabout way. The sheer degree of degenerate and insane behavior is enough for a dozen of Andrews' books. The shocking scene in which the returned Francine is drugged and then violated by Paul makes one's skin crawl. She escapes, but will literally bear the scars of her encounter the rest of her life. And the eventual deaths of the three remaining Hazeltines, physically decaying like the mouldering tomb of a house in which they live, are both grotesquely sad and morbidly disturbing. Lewis makes great use of images that convey the moral and psychological decay of this family: cracked dishes, broken bed springs, sagging and dusty furniture, dining room tables heaped with years' accumulations of newspapers. Everything is coated with a patina of rottenness, but its impossible to look away from these three freaks masquerading as a civilized, proper family.

My only problem is that I wish this book could have been more detailed.Some of the plot points had a lot of potential to be used, but it wasn't really taken advantage of, since some parts felt somewhat skimpy.

If you're looking for a cookbook that doesn't have a lot of Cuban and Puerto Rican recipes this is a good choice. Just know that the largest recipe section is drink and desserts. The other sections are rather small in comparison and some of the recipes aren't what I would consider Caribbean staples. For example, the fish section has a few recipes with salt cod and other fish like snapper and grouper but several of the recipes in this section call for lobster, crab, shrimp, even salmon and scallops. None of the fritters recipes used salt cod. One used lobster/crab, the other used a generic \\"white fish\\", and a third used ham or bacon.

Although it has always gone well, until now, I had never made the attempt to get deep under the hood and examine what is happening behind the scenes. It always seemed that delving into the C++ code would be a low Return On Investment (ROI) operation. When I first received this book, I read the blurbs and was somewhat skeptical. However, once I started, the reading was completed in less than a day, and the ROI was rather high.It was gratifying to learn that some of the implementations were as I had always suspected. The basics of underlying data transfer are thoroughly introduced and several of the points made in the book will be incorporated into the next rewrite of my ASP material. While it does help to understand C++, particularly Visual C++, it is not an absolute requirement.I learned more about the underlying mechanics of IIS and ASPs in the reading of this book than I have in over six sessions of a class where students and I always tinker with the code.

As a heavy-duty ASP programmer, the subject seemed very interesting and relevant, but the book was quite a let down.There was nothing terribly deep here. I was hoping that we might learn about how ASP works as a very high bandwidth service, but all we learn is very straightforward info that is more or less obvious to anyone with COM and IIS experience. True, there was some discussion of Microsoft's continued use of undocumented interfaces (!) that is probably not findable anywhere else, but these tended to be minutiae of how ASP works.Since the theme of the book is the ASP clone that Flanders wrote, you'd think the source code would be available somehow. There are lots of excerpts in the text, but it would be nice to be able to see the whole thing somewhere - and perhaps even try to run it. But if this code is available somewhere, I couldn't find it.The book is advertised as 212 pages, but in fact the text is a grand total of 123 whole pages - the font is large, and big margins....The level of discourse was also very uneven. The first chapter was a first-level cut at how HTTP works, which I would hope would be blindingly obvious to the target audience for this book.So kudos are in order for taking on a new and important topic - at least it wasn't yet another copy of publicly available documentation.

If you actually see patients and try to intervene in a helpful way then this book should be required reading. The ancient process of history taking and doing a competent physical examination ( a finger in every orifice included!!) is a lost art and can only be recovered by an intentional desire to come to a working diagnosis before they hit the CT room. Alas, since many are paid by number of encounters per hour the incentive is to triage rather than diagnose. This book is a great antidote and with patience, time and effort an average physician could become extraordinary. Since becoming extraordinary only increases your risk of liability today I would recommend it stay on the dusty bookshelf and await a future renaissance time when excellent physicians are actually valued in society and NOT SEEN AS A COMMODITY TO BE TRADED, BOUGHT AND SOLD."},{"Title":"Cope's Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen","review":"The book came within a couple days of ordering it.

However, we are left in the dark as to why Marguerite (the heroine) came to marry the wretch in the first place.The best part was the inclusion of Jacqueline Montarri, from the Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium II: Children of the Night. I won't tell you who she is if you don't know, but she is truly a chilling enemy and one I wish had been better utilized in this tale.The story was fantastic up until the end, where it seemed to suddenly grow tired as we waited for Marguerite to... well, I won't say, as it is one of the major turning points of the book. However, I wish that some space had been given to the domain's history (I don't even know its name; Donskoy?), save that it is an island and that Donskoy basically captured it long ago.In all, I recommend the book, even if it is slow at times, and think it to be one of the better ones in the series."},{"Title":"To Sleep With Evil (Ravenloft)","review":"To Sleep with Evil by Andria Cardarelle is the fourth book in the recently re-released Ravenloft line.

I would like to go more in-depth about this plot, but quite honestly, that's really all there is to the plot. At best the plot is mildly interesting; at its worst it is a slow ponderous foray into a cure for insomnia. It's just not that interesting of a book. It almost seems to me that the author had enough material for a short story and stretched it to fill 308 pages to make a novel.The characters in this book are mildly interesting at times.

The character Marguerrite, is the clich&eacute;d maiden that does her best to survive in challenging circumstances and somehow develops extraordinary skills to discover things and survive where countless others have not. The most interesting character is Ramus, yet he only appears in about 30-40 pages of this book, leaving the rest of the book to flounder through until the next point he surfaces.

Her parents, in an effort to save her from her stalker-vampire, broker a deal to betroth her to a total stranger; a somewhat wealthy lord in a far away land. The Vistani, a.k.a. gypsies, drug her and take her through the mysterious mists to the land that will be her new home. The gypsies drop her off on an abandoned looking road in the middle of a dark forest since they refuse to take her any further. With the foreboding cryptic comments of the gypsies hanging in her ears, she is picked up by two servants of her betrothed, Lord Donskoy. The crusty and creepy servants take her to the decrepit decaying castle that is her new home. She meets her betrothed who, while twice her age, appears to be nice if somewhat moody. Once settled into her new home, Marguerite befriends Zosia the cook who is an old Vistani witch and Yelena the mute girl who is her personal servant. She also befriends a strange gypsy man, Ramus, who lives in the surrounding forest and helps her home one day when she is lost.The day after she arrives Lord Donskoy declares the marriage will take place the day after tomorrow. Meanwhile, Marguerite discovers the presence of her betrothed's mistress, Jacqueline Montarri, on the eve of her wedding in the castle, and also at the wedding and reception. She assumes that her new husband will set aside his mistress once the marriage takes place. But he does not. After the ceremony and the consummation of their marriage, Donskoy insists on strange bizarre rituals to discover if Marguerite is pregnant or not. He is determined to have a son, no matter what the cost. When the tests continually reveal she is not pregnant, Donskoy grows furious and strikes her. He vows that if she does not conceive soon, he will put her aside and sell her off to other lords he knows in favor of a more fertile wife; hinting that he might even kill her to be rid of her. Fearing for her marriage and her life, Marguerite is jealous of the attraction she senses between her husband and Jacqueline.Consumed by unease and jealousy, Marguerite comes to depend on her friendship with Zosia. After several disturbing events, such as the apparition of her husbands deceased first wife, and signs of a gypsy curse, Marguerite begins to suspect something is very wrong with Donskoy and his strange household. One night she follows Donskoy, his mistress, and his deformed 'acquaintances', into the dark forest. She witnesses them slaughter inoccent stranded travelers, reveling in the bloodshed. Horrified, she unintentionally reveals her presence and her husbands hounds hunt her down. Now on the run, she knows she can't go home, believing Donskoy will kill her for what she has seen. She decides to leave, but finds she cannot. When she enters the mists and comes out the other side she finds herself even closer to the very castle she is trying to flee from. It is then she finally believes what others have implied, that the mists are magical and prevent anyone except the Vistani (and those of powerful magic) from leaving. In order to leave she must have a gypsy guide so she seeks out Ramus, who instead of helping her escape as she thought, bespells her so that she agrees to lay with him and conceives a son. He tells her that her husband is cursed, and as such cannot ever sire a child, in order to help her and spare her life of her husbands rage, he begets a child on her that will be passed off as her husbands. He tells her she must return to Donskoy, who won't kill her now that she bears his child. Then Ramus disappears leaving her no choice but to return when Donskoy's servants find her.She soon falls seriously ill. Her pregnancy is far from normal and her belly swells more rapidly than it should. Only five months along she births the child, who has monstrous claws and black scarred hands. Then, this is where the book is a bit confusing, the baby turns into a shadow monster that takes on the form of a serpent and kills Donskoy. With the evil Lord Donskoy dead Zosia sends a now insane Marguerite off with a caravan of gypsies to return her to her home land of Darkon, where all her memories of her former life are erased and replaced with an entirely new identity.And thats where the story ends, just as it was getting interesting. We're never told what happens to the baby/monster/shadow serpent that Marguerite bore. We don't know what happens to Ramus, the child's true father, or if the curse he is under is broken too. We don't know what happens to Zosia, Yelena, or the others left behind at the castle. The evil Jacqueline Montarri, presumably, is left now completely in charge and free to wreak evil wherever she wants without Donskoy to restrain her.I don't mind a book with an unhappy ending, in fact I find it quite refreshing. But the one thing I can't stand, especially in this book; are all the loose ends and the complete lack of any form of closure or resolution. The story just seems so unfinished, perhaps because the author intends a sequel? But whatever the cause, once I finished reading this book I was left with a distinct feeling of disappointment, dissatisfaction, and frustration. I wanted to know what happened to all the other characters! Especially, Ramus who seems to be a damned and lost soul looking for redemption. Overall, the story just seemed so pointless to me. At the end of the novel Marguerite is in a worse position than when she first started. She is returned to the same land she fled in fear of her life (I presume with the same stalker-vampire waiting to pounce on her since the author never clarifies this), and the only reason she's not insane is because her memories were erased and replaced with happier ones. She ends up a far cry from the young, inoccent, and beautiful girl she first starts as; and not in a positive way. All the other characters, with the exception of Donskoy, are pretty much the same as when the novel began (at least I assume so since the ending never says otherwise). The characters, with the exception of Marguerite, fail to undergo any development, and Marguerite's changes were all for the worse. The author's writing and descriptions are excellent but the total lack of closure at the end makes the whole novel meaningless in my opinion. Afterwards I was left wondering what point was the author trying to convey, but (at least in my case) failed to do so? Why did she feel compelled to write this seemingly random and pointless story that has no real ending? And most importantly, why did I waste my time reading this? Therefore, my overall recommendation is to avoid this book. Maybe a sequel would make this book more bearable, tying up all the loose ends, but I doubt it."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Heyer is best known for her several dozen light and humorous romances set in Regency England, but she also was capable of far deeper and more complex historical writing. Before Heyer, the best known and most highly regarded fictional account of the Battle of Waterloo was in Thackeray's classic _Vanity Fair_. (Victor Hugo wrote about the battle, too, in _Les Mis&eacute;rables_, but he was writing from the French viewpoint.) More recently, Bernard Cornwell, justifiably famous for his rousing and highly accurate battle scenes, did a marvelous grunt's-eye view of the battle in _Sharpe's Waterloo_. So how does this novel fare, compared to those? Heyer's approach focuses much more on the tension-filled events of the previous three or four months leading up to the climax at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. Brussels was filled with high-ranking English civilians and officers' families who were taking the opportunity of Napoleon's exile to Elba to travel to the Continent for the first time in a generation. The Peace Conference was under way down in Vienna and the victors were celebrating. When the Emperor re-entered France and proclaimed his return to the throne, gathering his old subordinates around him and being cheered by most of the French people, the Allies were caught unprepared (the best and most experienced English regiments had been sent across the Atlantic to fight the Americans). But the frenzy of balls and society picnics in Brussels foreshadowed a similar mood in Paris in 1940, as the Germans were tooling up to invade. It's that atmosphere, alternating between complacent boredom and near panic, that Heyer captures so well.There are two stories here, actually. The first, we observe from afar, in a sense: The arrival of the Duke of Wellington, the filtering into town of his subordinate senior officers, and the gradual acceleration of the preparations to confront Napoleon. Nearly everyone in this plot-line is a real historical figure and Heyer does an excellent job of describing their personalities and styles and the often touchy ways they interact -- especially the English, Dutch, and Prussians. The other story, which we see close-up, is the awkward and often painful off-again-on-again romance between Col. Charles Audley, the eldest and most experienced of Wellington's aides -- the Duke's \\"family\\" -- and the young widow, Lady Barbara Childe, who was raised badly by her father (her mother having died when she was small) and has become an unbridled and ungovernable \\"wild child.\\" Charles falls irretrievably in love with the beautiful and lethally sexy Lady Barbara almost at first sight -- a notion which has always seemed improbable to me, but I suppose it happens -- and proposes to her within hours of meeting her. And Barbara accepts, for reasons she doesn't really understand herself, because she's certainly not going to stop flirting or deliberately shocking people or behaving with complete lack of propriety. Charles says he doesn't want a tame, dutiful, obedient wife, but Barbara, who seems to live for scandal, is more than even he can handle and things, naturally, go awry. The story of their relationship is complex and multilayered and Heyer's examination of their competing personalities is first-rate -- and far more interesting than in most of her lighter romances. The supporting cast here, in the form of Col. Audley's brother, the Earl of Worth, and his sister-in-law, Lady Judith Worth, n&eacute;e Taverner, and Judith's brother, Sir Peregrine Taverner and his young wife (all of whom first appeared in Regency Buck), are also very well done.In fact, there is a great deal of very good writing everywhere in this book. But most notable is Chapter 17, which describes the Duchess of Richmond's famous ball on the night before Napoleon's approach, with its descriptions of the Highlander infantrymen, accompnaied by their pipers, dancing reels for the attendees (most of them would be dead the next day), the news being brought in by mud-stained young gallopers, the more junior officers immediately hurrying off to rejoin their regiments, the Duke of Wellington determinedly showing a cheerful countenance and then asking for a map, and finally the regiments called from their billets and sorting themselves out in the center of town, forming up, and marching off in the dawn to leave Brussels empty and silent. All this provides some of the most moving and affecting descriptive writing I have ever read. Equally mesmerizing is the picture she paints of high-born ladies of fashion forgetting their complexions and their intramural jealousies and intrigues and getting down in the dirt and the blood to care for the wounded who manage to stagger back to Brussels, \\"toiling as their scullery-maids had never done.\\" Beautiful stuff. In fact, the only section of the book that isn't quite up to scratch is the detailed order of battle in which the author indulges between Quatre Bras and Waterloo itself; it's a result, I'm sure, of her insistence on meticulous research, but it could have been considerably shortened and summarized with no loss whatever to the story. My recommendation is to go to Cornwell's Sharpe for the strategy and tactics, the blood and guts, of one of the most important military engagements in Western history -- but read this marvelous book for the psychology and the personalities on the Allied side of the battle and of the period leading up to it."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Georgette Heyer was the master of historical fiction, particularly in the Regency era. 'An Infamous Army' focuses rather more on historical events than the romance than most of her other novels, its central theme being the description of the Battle of Waterloo and the events leading up to it.The main characters in this story are Colonel Charles Audley and Lady Barbara Childe; Charles Audley appeared as the younger brother of Lord Worth in \\"Regency Buck\\" and Barbara Childe is the grandaughter of Dominic and Mary from \\"Devil's Cub\\". There has been a slight fudging of historical dates to fit these characters in but it is interesting to read more of Lord Worth and Judith's marriage in this story as parts of the book are told from Judith's point of view. Many readers may find Barbara Childe a rather unsympathetic character, her wild behaviour and rather cavalier treatment of Charles Audley can be hard to stomach; however, as the book continues and the battle takes place she shows more depth to her character, despite her faults. Charles's instant attraction to her isn't always understandable but in some ways the love story in this book feels very much as a hook upon which to pin the main thrust of the book, the battle itself.The romance in the story is definitely subsidiary to the historical events which are described with an excellent attention to detail. The way that society in Brussels continued its usual round of Balls and Soir&eacute;es as the French troops drew nearer was fascinating, as were the portrayals of several historical characters, not least the Duke of Wellington, the horror and agony of war and the real possibility that Napoleon's troops might have prevailed.Although an excellent book the heavy emphasis on the fighting of the battle of Waterloo means that it isn't particularly easy reading. It's also quite a long book and with the usual Heyer writing style which is full of cant phrases that can be hard to understand for a first-time Heyer reader. Still she is many people's favourite historical novelist for good reasons and this book does not disappoint with the quality of the writing, the historical detail and the author's excellent storytelling ability.Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book, www.curledup.com.

I have always hesitated about starting this book. I knew it would feel a little sad, like visiting with very dear old friends for the very last time before each goes their own way...I have always loved Charles in Regency Buck, in this book he was his usual merry, good humoured self, a little more mature but just as amusing as ever. Barbara had her great-grandma Leonie's hair and eyes, and she is a true scandal-creating,arrogant, spoiled Alastair that you can't help but like. Judith had turned a little more prudish that I would have thought for someone who used to take snuff and have a curricle race on the way to Brighton ( Regency Buck). Julian the quiet strength and as always a wonderful brother. Mary (Duchesse of Avon) her usual no-nonsense, practical self. Dominic is still my favorite Alastair. The tumultuous courtship between Barbara and Charles was what I would expect of an Alastair and an Audley...A note of warning: this is one of the sadder Heyer books. The second half of the book is poignant with a very realistic portrait of a society living in the middle of a war: partying in the middle of chaos, loosing dear friends to the senselessness of war, and finally the bitter-sweet end. I cried my eyes out in the last few chapters... a rarity when reading a Heyer!!!!I loved this book. I strongly recommend it, probably not as an introduction to Heyer's world but definitely at one point when one realises the genius of that woman and the tour de force she accomplished once more with her attention to historical details..."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"After reading several reviews on this site I was a little bit reluctant to read this book specially when I saw someone had given only 3 stars. I guess I was in for a great surprise! This is the best novel I have ever read. It has everything war, romance etc.... I was surprised that some people didn't even see the romance between Charles and Barbara. Let me say one thing I grew up in a war (Beirut-Lebanon)and every emotion that people experience in this book is for real. Giving parties, dancing, falling in love from the first sight, horrors of war, people without limbs etc.........It's all real. I just couldn't put the book down. Thanks God I have been living in USA for the past 17 years, but you never forget those crazy days. I give 5 stars although the book deserves million stars.

Ms. Heyer uses characters from previous books, \\"The Devil's Cub,\\" \\"Regency Buck,\\" and refers to characters from \\"These Old Shades\\" to build this enthralling romance that has no happy ending.Reading the four (her only series) is a visit with old friends, when you need a fix for good writing, strong characters, good dialogue, and a firm sense of a historical period.Nash Black, author of \\"Taxes, Stumbling Blocks and Pitfalls for Authors 2007\\" and \\"Qualifying Laps.\\""},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"The events surrounding the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 are so accurately researched and well presented that this book has been used in many history classrooms. The love story between &quot;Bad Bab&quot; Childe and Charles Audley is moving, but you get the feeling this is one Heyer couple that's not headed for &quot;happily ever after&quot;. Lady Barbara is an unusual heroine who shines during the darkest moments of war, but her capacity for self-absorption and cruelty when she is bored or offended would make her a mighty uncomfortable wife for the gallant and kind-hearted Colonel Audley."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I. Love. Georgette. Heyer. She rules. She rocks. Insert your soon-to-be-timeworn accolade here.No one else can capture the meeting of spirits and minds that constitutes the beginning of true love the way Heyer can. In (almost all of) her romances, when hero and heroine first speak to each other, you know, immediately, that these two people -- no matter how unalike they appear -- are two of a kind. Their love is inevitable.I've said all this, clumsily, because in \\"An Infamous Army,\\" Heyer makes almost every mistake in the romance writer's book. Let's count 'em.1. The heroine is too gorgeous to be true. Lesser writers commit this sin, but (normally) not Heyer. Every man wants her, and I do mean EVERY man. Yawn. In one scene, the heroine merely smiles at a man and he leaves the side of his pregnant wife to spend the evening in her company. Riiiiiiight.2. The hero falls in love with her instantly ... because she's beautiful, and ONLY because she's beautiful. Did I mention he's 35 and universally described as sensible? I guess he fooled them!3. The heroine is, for approximately 400 pages, selfish, capricious, ill-tempered and cruel. Yet we're supposed to root for her.4. The hero is, for more than 400 pages, content to stand by the heroine's selfishness and cruelty and, at times, even defend her. He iz stoopid.5. Most of the scenes that drive the romance plot are seen through the eyes of, not the hero, not the heroine, but the hero's sister-in-law ... who's already had her own book.6. Did I mention how mean the heroine is? When it comes time to throw the reader a bone -- c'mon, don't hate the heroine! -- the best defense a character can come up with is to TELL (not show) us that occasionally the heroine has visited a sick soldier, rather than go to a ball. Given the number of balls we do see her attend, she must have cloned herself back in 1815 to accomplish the sickroom vigils. We never see her being kind, or courteous, or considerate, or even rueful. Ever.7. Eventually, the hero has a falling out with the heroine. Go, hero! At this point you pray that Heyer will do something completely unexpected and find another heroine for Mr. Hero. And yet.8. The heroine has a moment of redemption, in which she nurses injured soldiers with little complaint. This is admirable. If she were halfway likable, you could buy this experience as being enough to mature her. But. Heyer even has a character observe, drily, that the heroine's redemption might well wear off, once the drama of the battle is over. Word. I mean: WORD! But then the hero comes back from battle, wounded, and goodgawdalmighty, he takes the beeeeyatch back.That was the sound of a book hitting Sheetrock.9. There's a subplot that is mishandled, too, not only in being so confusing you need a chart to name the players, but also in forcing several characters to behave nastily ... just when you really need them to not be nasty. Yes, the heroine is one of them.So. Heyer, the ultimate historical romance writer, really laid an egg with this love story.But the story of Waterloo, of Wellington and his staff and the battle itself, is very well-done, if you like that sort of thing."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This book is ASTONISHING! Both historically and as a novel. But do yourself a huge favour and go to this link and use it to refer to the battle plans as you read through the action of the battle.[I can't give you the link. It must be against the rules. Go to greatmilitarybattles.com and find the waterloo page and the battle plans.]You will not be sorry. Doing this, not only clarified exactly what was going on in the battle but it gives it a setting. It increased both my understanding and enjoyment of an incredible book.I actually printed off the first plan and kept it in my hand to refer to as I went. If they ever reissue this, I think they should add a print in the the inside cover.But don't just see this novel as a war book or think its just about a battle. There's so much to it than than that. I was put off reading it for years because of the subject, which is a shame. It deserves to be read. I thought it was an absolutely stunning piece of work, underpinned with a lovely relationship. I hope you won't miss it."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Georgette Heyer wrote a terrific history of Waterloo - so well done, in fact, that both Sandhurst (in the UK) and West Point (in the US) have used this book in their military classes. However, her popularity was largely for romances, and she inserts one here, which doesn't completely meld. If you like history, you may want to skip the fiction. If you like romance, you may want to skim past the battle details. If you like both, however, you will really enjoy this. A better work of Heyer's is \\"The Spanish Bride\\", which combines a true romance with the true military details of the Peninsular War. She has less difficulty joining the threads of that book, since the characters were real, and she took most of her information from their memoirs. As an aside, it is a mild pleasure to see the descendants or relatives of characters from other Heyer novels."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"A wonderful and accurate account of the Battle of Waterloo and evoking brilliantly the atmosphere in Brussels before, during and after the event. Heyer reintroduces characters from Regency Buck and Devil's Cub in a very realistic romantic story. The charming brother of the Earl of Worth, Charles Audley, falls heavily for Lady Barbara Childe, spoilt and headstrong grand-daughter of the Duke of Avon (Devil's Cub). Their story is anything but straightforward and is intertwined that of other characters both fictional and real. As usual Heyer's research is immaculate and the historical facts are seamlessly woven into the story. Like the Spanish Bride its really more of a history lesson than any of her other books but wonderfully done."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Since I read \\"These Old Shades\\" last year I have loved Heyer completely and have spent a small fortune acquiring her books. This, I have to say, was one of the rare disappointments. I suppose one could enjoy this book very much if one were interested in Wellington and the war. The book is very well researched and absolutely perfect in the war aspect. But for someone who picks up a Heyer to immerse herself in heady romance, it is bound to be a disappointment."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This is different from most of Georgette Heyer's novels. It's very heavy on historical details, historical people, battle scenes, etc. And, when a book gets into battle accounts, and troop movements, and strategic planning, my eyes start to glaze over, and I start skimming heavily. However, those details are such a huge part of the book, that I ended up skipping over much of it.And the relationships aspect of the book wasn't particularly strong. I enjoyed the character of Lady Worth, but I didn't find the romance between Lady Barbara and Colonel Audley that believable. They both fall for each other in relatively short order, despite the fact that they are very different people. The behavior Barbara engages in is often the type that Audley would find appalling, but somehow he sees that she's really good underneath, despite having had only a few minutes with her. I also had no real attachment to Lady Barbara with her general recklessness, selfishness, playing men off of each other, etc. I thought Colonel Audley deserved better. There were, however, some nice scenes and bits of dialogue, a strength of Heyer's.Still, unless you're a fan of battle descriptions, I wouldn't recommend this book. After you skip over those sorts of details, the romance left is only of so-so quality."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This is my first read by Georgette Heyer. I've heard a lot about her, and I mean a lot, both from the historical fiction and the historical romance readers I know. She is the favorite of many, many readers. I was expecting a lot, and the book didn't disappoint. It is, in fact, a pleasing mix of romance and historical fiction.Lady Barbara Childe is the female equivalent of a rake. She flirts with many men, but refuses to get married after her first atrocious attempt. Colonel Charles Audley, however, is determined, patient, understanding, and in love with Barbara. They quickly get engaged, but that isn't the end of the story, although it had me confused for a bit, wondering where they would go next. On the other hand, there is the lead up to the Battle of Waterloo. As one of the Duke's personal staff, Charles is bound to go to the fighting and a great deal of the book deals with the looming conflict and the battle itself.I definitely was immersed in the period while reading this book. The beginning was a little slow because it takes time to get used to a whole different world. Heyer never slips out of it, and while the book was written a good 70 years ago, I still think that's impressive. The characters surprised me and jumped out of the page; especially Barbara, who is incredibly compelling and understandable by the end, despite the fact that she is about as different from me as possible.The best part, however, was definitely Waterloo. The book alternates between Charles' family and the battle itself, giving us two viewpoints. Heyer does a brilliant job getting across the tension, the distress, and the complete alienation from the world that the patient loved ones are feeling. The battle scenes are astounding and even upsetting because the author puts you right into the army's shoes. This is historical fiction at its best, showing us what the past may have been like.So now I begin to understand why Georgette Heyer is so popular. I've got another of hers waiting in my TBR pile and I'll be on the lookout for more. Her books are being reissued, so this may not be too difficult. The lovely cover above is the result of this reissue."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"An Infamous Army is the story of General Wellington's successful routing of Napoleon Bonaparte in the battle of Waterloo. As Napoleon's troops make their way towards Brussels, General Wellington is having trouble obtaining solid and trained soldiers and enough ammunition and artillery to fight the battle successfully. Beloved by his forces, Wellington must direct and marshal the tactical forces over the countryside in order to overtake the French forces. In addition to those problems, he is working with various other military leaders and troops not under his command, and the effort to create a unified front is one of the major problems in this battle. The mood in Brussels, however, is one of excitement and merriment, as many of the English gentry are visiting Brussels, and fete's and dinners are the order of the day. Of the party going set, the most illustrious is the Lady Barbara Childe. Barbara, a young widow, is flamboyantly fashionable and out to take the city by storm. Both glamorous and ostentatious, Lady Barbara has her pick of men among the crowd, and is never without an admirer. Her bold behavior and extravagant flirting keep her name constantly on the lips of those around her. But Lady Barbara is not prepared for her unexpected feelings for Colonel Charles Audley, whom she meets at a party. Audley too is quite smitten with Barbara, and instantly proposes marriage, a situation which shocks and stuns their social set. Can Barabara put away her coquettish ways for Audley and make herself a true and devoted wife? As these questions loom, Napoleon advances, and the battle begins in all it's bloody glory. When all is said and done, many will be lost and injured, and all must look to the future in their newly changed circumstances, including Audley and Lady Barbara.Normally, I love historical fiction. I enjoy the enlightenment of discovering little known details surrounding historical events, and the glimpse into the lives of characters who have changed the course of history, even when they are slightly embellished. However, this book was not very enjoyable. The amount of detail, while impressive, was overwhelming. Some of the military tactical information and battle scenes seemed to go on forever, and the jump back to the events surrounding Barbara and Audley seemed too few and far between. I also disliked the minutia of the details. For example, there was a lot of information on the various colors and styles of the uniforms of the soldiers, which divisions had been deployed, and who was leading them. It was almost like reading a roster of names... very dry and lackluster. While I appreciate the amount of research that went into this account of Waterloo, it was very uninteresting and leaden. Perhaps if one were reading this as a history book, it would have been different, but I believe that the inclusion of the story of Barbara and Audley failed at the attempt to elevate this book into the realms of historical fiction. They seemed an afterthought, something pushed in to give the story some flavor to a rather dull military procedural. The book's tone was one of instruction, and rather than being interesting, it was instead informative.I also disliked Lady Barbara. I don't believe that in order to be a complex character you have to be cruel, but that's exactly what Lady Barbara was. She was very spoiled and recalcitrant, always pushing the boundaries of propriety just because she liked to make a spectacle of herself. Many times in the book she admitted to being an intolerable vixen, yet she shrugged it off and claimed that her behavior was something she enjoyed and would continue. If she had not made other's so uncomfortable and ill at ease I could have accepted that. However, she seemed to enjoy playing one man off another and disappointing her friends and family. In one scene she specifically begins to take interest in a man in order to take revenge on his wife for a small social slight. I found this to be repulsive and ill-bred. It was almost unbelievable that Colonel Audley felt so strongly for her, because he was the most gentlemanly and kind person in the book. I found them to be a bad match, and an implausible one as well. Barbara spent the book flitting off from one flirtation to the next, dropping each one as her interest waned. I did not believe that her behavior would change after circumstances were altered. She seemed flighty and her serious emotions were not believable, and I had no patience for her or her antics by the end of the book. I lost a little respect for Audley's character for being so blind to her shenanigans, and felt this portion of the book to be highly vexing.Although I didn't enjoy this book very much, I can see that it has its importance. Looking at it from a historical perspective, it is quite an accomplishment. The stellar research and the author's ability to keep all the specific information clear and well paced might be more appreciated by some who are fond of military history. Had the story been less focused on the battle and more focused on the periphery I would have enjoyed it more, and been better able to recommend it. As it was, this book was not really to my taste."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Great history, in its way a marvelous anti-war novel and, of course, the great Georgette Heyer romance at its best."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This book seemed to bog down. I know waterloo was a horrible battle and I learned some from this book, but for some reason the book dragged."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Heyer is the role model for Anya Seton and Philippa Gregory. and in that tradition, her characters are so well described that the reader can easily visualize them and feel empathy, disdain, or dislike as the author intended. The historical backgroud is rich and accurate. The only drawback might be that the language and dialogue might be a big awkward for readers not used to the speech patterns of the upper classes during this time period. I do encourage readers who find it so to persevere and perhaps reread a page or paragraph until the flow becomes more comfortable. I believe that after the war with Napoleon, this book was required reading for British military men as an example of how not to run an army or a campaign."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Very interesting book but a little hard going with all the Battle of Waterloo detail, which was certainly thorough and I learned a lot more than I previously knew"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Fictional and historical figures together to describe the Battle of Waterloo both from the military and civilian perspective.

I became so interested in the Battle of Waterloo that I searched and read several other essays on this topic. Heyer uses several quotes of Wellington's in the book. It is a very accurate account of the battle. It brings to life the human tragedy and the horrific toll taken on all that are caught up in the unfolding horrors of war. The first two books in the trilogy should be read first to develop an understanding for the Alastair family."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"A sweeping romance of Lady Barbara, fiery tempered grand-daughter of theDuke of Avon and one of Wellington's Aide-de-camp's, Charles Audley. Set against Napoleon's Hundred Days. A mere three months in Brussells which culminated in the battle of Waterloo.For confirmed Heyer fans this novel is the conclusion of two series. It winds up the affairs of the Dukes of Avon who we have read about through The Black Moth, These Old Shades, and Devil's Cub. And the affairs of the Earl of Worth's younger brother, first introduced to us in Regency Buck. An Infamous Army is the last time Heyer wrote a sequel. The book is immaculately researched and comes with a formidable bibliography of sources used. As Heyer was also best friends with Carola Oman, whose father Charles wrote one of the seminal works of the Peninsular War and Waterloo, she had impeccable sources at hand for this book.Many people might be put off by the long battle descriptions of Waterloo towards the end of thestory, if you aren't interested in military history then much of the detail can be fast forwarded through - although bear in mind that Sandhurst, that most British of officer training instituions has used Heyer's book as a study piece for this battle. This is no light-weight rehashing of the facts.I find myself torn by the this book. It is very good, and the story of Charles and Lady Barbara gripping - but the mix of the two styles - Historical battle description and fictional romance just doesn't work well for me. I find that I compare this book with MM Kaye's novel, The Far Pavillion's in which there is a long description of the seige at Kabul . I skim over that section whenever I re-read it - but you can't skim them completely, you see both books have two of the saddest events tucked away in the middle of the battle scence. Scenes which make me howl with tears each time I read them. In Kaye it is the death of Wally, in An Infamous Army there is an equally gut-wrenching death - but I won't tell you because it might spoil the book for you. Heyer deals with the event so well, it is stripped of pathos and false emotion.An Infamous Army was written in 1937, and shows all the strengths and weaknesses of Heyer's style. Her incredible attention to detail, her ability to blend various sources into a gripping story, and yet while the book is very good, it struggles between its desire to be a serious attempt to represent the battle of Waterloo, and its need to be a romantic novel.I find this conflict apparent in most of Heyer's Historic novels (Spanish Bride, Great Roxhythe, The Conqueror) It was really only her second to last attempt at a Historical novel, the following year, 1938, that I think she finally cracked the code. Royal escape sticks closely to the detail, and doesn't try to interweave too many fictional elements into it. In Spanish Bride, her last historical, a story of Harry and Juana Smith on the Peninsular, again I feel she suffers from historical detail overwhelming the story.Finally, I have always assumed that the character of Charles Audley is based on John Kincaid whose two memoirs - Adventures in the Rifle Brigade and Random Shots, Heyer used as sources for this book. Their natures, good-humour and general character are so similar. It is interesting that in An Infamous Army she has the two characters meeting up.If you do enjoy this book, then John Kincaid's two books have been republished and are available through Amazon - they are well worth reading and I think he is the best author to start reading - he is such good fun"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"but oh my gosh, it demands twice as many again! An Infamous Army is an incredible book. On one level, it is considered by Waterloo historians to be one of the most important texts ever written about the Battle of Waterloo and its aftermath; and actually used to be - I don't know if it still is - a compulsory read for all Army cadets and students of military history. And on another level, it features a passionate, outrageous romance between the lovely, scandalous Lady Barbara Childe - the ultimate of all Heyer's Bad Women - and Charles Audley, the handsome and dashing soldier. She is the descendant of the hero and heroine of Heyer's great 18th century melodrama, &quot;These Old Shades&quot;. He is related to the Earl of Worth in &quot;Regency Buck&quot;. Their blazing and passionate courtship sets this book almost on fire. Babs, brazen as her red hair, is definitely the most shocking of all Heyer's heroines. The book is full of character development set against a practically flawless reconstruction of the events surrounding 1815. Heyer handles tragedy, humour (ranging from the decorous to the deliciously vulgar), high emotion, dislike and distrust, arguments, and pathos, and a dozen other elements without the smallest suggestion of sentimentality. The only problem is that, if you are not a military buff, you may find the description of Waterloo hard to follow. But I just allow this wonderful book to flow past me, and have re-read it many times. Many critics consider this Heyer's greatest achievement, and I must agree. It blends her two main features - her humour and her historical accuracy - so that both stand on their own, yet complement one another. Along with Cotillion, a witty subversion of Heyer's own traditional Regency plots (I've also reviewed this book on Amazon); and The Grand Sophy, which was voted one of the top 400 Novels of the Millennimum recently; An Infamous Army shows Georgette Heyer at her best. If only all set books could be this enjoyable!"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I cannot believe that when I read reader reviews of Miss Heyer's work that I see numerous comparisons to Barbara Cartland! What an insult to one of the great writers of the 20th century. Cartland produced nothing but badly written attempts to rip off Georgette Heyer's work. I hope that during her lifetime Miss Heyer's sense of humor allowed her to bear it.\\"An Infamous Army\\",an account of Waterloo from the perspective of numerous old & beloved characters,along with some new ones, is,as always,true literature and highly recommended to anyone who appreciates fine historical writing. The accompanying love story is both tragic and joyous. You will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This book is a must for anyone who likes both history and romance- and neither clean and neat. It's the story of of a difficult woman who's had a difficult life and a soldier who's had everything- but is not a wimp. An Infamous Army is still required reading at Sandhurst (the military school the English Royal family attend) and I infer at many other schools. It is an epic tale and pulls no punches. Some readers have problems with it because the protaganists seem so ill-suited; I think that that is worked out in the \\"third act.\\" I'll admit that the love story is secondary to the battle of Waterloo, but if you have any desire to understand that battle on a large scale as well as on the microscopic scale of the people involved, I, and Sandhurst apparently, can recommend nothing better. I think the romance works out well as a mature acceptance of eachother. Barabara is shocked into accepting life as is Charles- both accept and appreciate the other with warts and all. I didn't like this novel as a young girl nearly as I appreaciate it as an appreciatively older girl- and I think that makes the point."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I have read this book several times, and just finished another re-reading. For many years, I only read the romance, but gradually phased in more of the history. Generally I love historical fiction. Unfortunately (or fortunately), Heyer was such a meticulous historian that she had had trouble blending it with fiction. Parts of the book can be quite dry unless you are a Waterloo historian.I have mixed feelings about the romance. I agree with the other reviewer that it's hard to see Charles and Barbara living happily ever after. They are both vital, interesting people but so different in type. Partly, this is because their basis for falling in love is never well established. They meet at a ball, and suddenly the capricious Barbara and the seasoned Charles have found true love? They have little in common; no meeting of minds or common values to build on. It's hard to agonize over their love affair. I join Charles' friends in believing he'd be happier with Lucy.In the real world of the Regency, they'd probably have had an affair instead. Barbara being a widow would have made it acceptable, if they were discreet. But in Heyer's 1930's world it was not possible to explore that in romantic fiction.This brings me to a few plot points that always bother me. There is the quarrel that separates them, involving Harriet and Perry. Charles says he'd already asked Barbara to sheath her sword where Harriet was concerned. True, but he ignores the additional provocation Barbara was given. It seems he wants to marry a spoiled, strong willed, hot tempered woman, but expects her to change completely the moment they become engaged. How realistic is that? It always makes Charles seem slightly priggish, in that final quarrel, and I feel that Barbara gets more blame than she deserves.The other thing I dislike is the attitude of Judith and Barbara towards Lucy once her secret is revealed. They are both so superior and contemptuous, though Barbara has done things far more scandalous.Good points of the book include following the further story of the Alastairs and the Worths, both improved from their original stories. I particularly enjoy the Duke and Duchess of Avon. It is this, plus the vividness of the characters and story, that makes it re-readable, even if you have to suspend disbelief over the romance."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Red-haired, green-eyed, tempestuous Lady Barbara Childe was a devastatingly beautiful widow. Her reputation, well deserved, was scandalous. For her, one man was enough. Or two. Or three. She was the talk of every dazzling party, ball, and concert.

He was a man of considerable strength. And he was not about to tolerate Lady Bab's outrageous, seductive games.

I love the romance side of this more serious and historic novel, and though, as many readers have already mentionned, the historic details of the battle of Waterloo can be quite overwhelming and confusing for a non military buff like me, I was very drawn by the atmosphere that I felt from the description of the battle and the personnality and behavior of the different groups of soldiers mentionned. Also for anybody who has visited or lived in Brussels, it was quite interesting to read the descriptions and mentions of places that are now parts or suburbs of this big city.Because of some reviews, I nearly did not read this book, but I am very happy that I did and will be reading it again sometimes in the future."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Of the several historical romances by Heyer that I read prior to Infamous Army, I very much appreciated Heyer's attention to detail in accurately portraying language, manner and custom and in avoiding anachronisms. Her scholarship was evident in the quality of her work without her work feeling scholarly. Infamous Army, on the other hand, feels like a text book. Frankly, I think I skimmed well over half the book in order to get past the biographical presentation of Wellington and the historical presentation of the Battle of Waterloo. I suppose I should have paid better attention to the subtitle, for it accurately foretold what the novel principally contains: Wellington, Waterloo and war. It was not my favorite."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"An absorbing story of two families that Heyer has written about in earlier books, and the story of the battle of Waterloo. It seems incredible that so many of the characters were at a fancy ball that evening before, but Wikipedia has the list: see Duchess of Richmond's Ball.I also find the format of Sourcebooks publications, with larger type and better paper than the usual paperbacks, to be a pleasure to read. I will be ordering more of their books."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I love this book, but if you're looking for a typical Regency romance, or even what most of her readers might expect from Georgette Heyer, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very heavy on the military history of the Battle of Waterloo, crowding out to some extent the humor and romance you might be looking for. This is a more serious book than many of her Regencies, although if you've read \\"The Spanish Bride\\" and enjoyed it, you'll probably like \\"An Infamous Army,\\" in that it has a similar approach to intertwining military history with romance. Also, if you've read \\"Regency Buck,\\" you'll run into some familiar characters from that novel."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"It's clear from this story that Georgette Heyer did her research. I've seen it written that the description of the battle of Waterloo was in fact used for teaching purposes as it's accuracy was that exact. It's interesting to see the characters before, during and after the war and how events change them.The pivotal characters, including Babs, are in Brussels at the start and really it's a home away from home for them, whiling their way through time with balls and dinners. The threat from Napoleon is there in the background but it's a vague threat, nothing that really impinges on life until it does. It's then that the characters discover more about their strengths and weaknesses and the brutality that is war.I would recommend this to anyone who dismisses Georgette Heyer, there is so much detail and interesting events in this that it's hard to know where to start praising it enough. The contrast between the frivolity of before the battle and the slaughter of the battle is well drawn. It's not my favourite of hers but it's almost a 5* story."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Spring and summer, 1815. It has been reported that Napoleon Bonaparte has left the isle of Elba and is marching down to France from the north. The Duke of Wellington and other commanders are gathering their armies to prepare for any potential attack, though most people think it will lead to nothing. The Duke describes his troops as an \\"infamous Army, very weak, and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced staff.\\" You can cut the tension with a knife. As Europe prepares for battle, Colonel Charles Audley, during his stay in Brussels, falls for Lady Barbara Childe, a beautiful widow with a questionable reputation. She is a flirt, has broken many hearts, which is why everyone is shocked when she accepts the colonel's marriage proposal. Audley is a penniless soldier, and everyone thought that she would go for a wealthy gentleman. As the Battle of Waterloo looms and the people begin to flee the premises, the lady and her brave colonel embark upon a journey of self-discovery all their own...I read this book about the same time as I reread Jane Austen's Emma, and I must say that it is difficult to pinpoint which one of the two I enjoyed reading the most. This is one of the best historical novels I have read in a very long time. Georgette Heyer describes Waterloo in such a way that you feel like you are there. She even describes the passage that Bonaparte takes in his effort to invade France. There is a main romantic plot centered on Lady Barbara and the Colonel, but the chapters that concentrate on the Duke of Wellington and the political affairs are much more fascinating. Put together, however, makes for a fascinating read. Georgette Heyer doesn't get enough credit for her novels. She -- like English contemporaries Daphne du Maurier, Mary Stewart and Anya Seton -- don't get the sort of praise that older novelists like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte get. Yet they deserve it, including Heyer, whose work includes some funny Regency romances, some of which I've read, but had also written intelligent historical fiction and dark mysteries. An Infamous Army, first published in 1937, is the perfect novel for those who love the Napoleonic era. Cannot recommend this enough!"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"When I'm in the mood for light reading, I pick up a Heyer novel. However, this one took me a while to get into due to the need to establish historic figures.

Of course I've read and re-read all the prequals to this book so I know where the threads are from the previous works. But this is a stand alone work of glorious historical sweep.

It was hard to understand all the military planning and battle action. I needed to see diagrams and pictures. It was also hard to follow the various officers' names by listening as opposed to reading. I understand the author did a lot of research in order to be accurate about the \\"Battle of Waterloo.\\" The narrator spoke too fast for me which did not help.I may be off on my percentages but it feels like half the book is about a relationship between an army officer and a widow. The other half is about military planning and fighting the Battle of Waterloo. This is NOT for someone wanting interesting and fully developed romantic relationships. I never understood what they saw in each other. It was just instant attraction at first sight.Two characters in this story (Barbara and George) are the grandchildren of characters in Devil's Cub. You do NOT need to read that book in advance. This is definitely a stand-alone book.There is a mystery about Lucy and her love interest (a minor third story). I can't remember how that was resolved or even if it was. It needed more explanation - or it could be my own bad memory.STORY BRIEF:Colonel Audley sees Barbara at a ball and falls in love at first sight. Barbara is a notorious widow who is unlikeable, mean, vain, and spoiled. She is beautiful and loves to flirt. She falls for the Colonel as well, but her bad behavior causes problems. Lucy is sad and we don't know why until much later in the book. The Battle of Waterloo is the second story. Colonel Audley is part of the action.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 14 hours.

Rediscovering them now, as an adult, I find it still delights me more than most.The plot, I must admit, is quite reminiscent of \\"Ozma of Oz\\" -- a girl and a mortal animal wash up on the shores of some fairyland, encounter the man Tik-Tok and find themselves trapped in a battle with the king of the Nomes. It has been said,in fact, that the plot of this novel came when Baum converted \\"Ozma\\" into a stage play, then converted the stage play back into a novel.However, the book itself is still quite delightful. We don't meet too many really interesting new characters in this book -- not as many as most Oz books, in fact -- but it no longer follows the tired \\"someone tries to get to the Emerald City and meets interesting creatures along the way\\" formula that began in the very first book and crippled several books after \\"Ozma.\\"Tititi-Hoochoo and Quox the Dragon stand out as the new characters, and it is the sequences featuring them that I find most entertaining. Kaliko and Ruggedo in the Nome Kingdom again draw a grin from me, and the final few pages have a laugh-out loud moment that must have come when someone pointed out an inconsistency in the Oz books that Baum had to suddenly explain away.\\"Tik-Tok of Oz\\" may not be the best of the Oz books, but it's probably the funniest, and it's certainly one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"Tik-Tok of Oz by L. Frank Baum (Books of Wonder edition)Tik-Tok of Oz is a delightful book with an interesting story of how it came to be. A small Editor's Note by Peter Glassman on page 10 of this book tells the story. There had been two successful stage plays based on the first two Oz books and Baum wanted to write a play based on the third, Ozma of Oz. However, he found out he couldn't use many of the characters because he had already sold the stage rights to them. He took the plot of the third book and changed Dorothy and Ozma into two new characters Betsy Bobbin and Queen Ann Soforth. Then he used the popular Shaggy Man who was introduced in The Road to Oz and changed many of the incidents in the story to create a new script for the stage that he called The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. The play was a success so he then rewrote it into this novel.If you have read Ozma of Oz, you will indeed see the similarities. Once again an army of one soldier and many officers is led by a girl leader in an attack against the Nome King. This time it is Queen Ann Soforth from the smallest and poorest kingdom in Oz. She is young and tired of her tiny kingdom and wants to seek adventure. When her sister jokingly suggests that Ann raise an army and conquer Oz, Ann likes the idea. She convinces all but one of the eighteen men of her kingdom to join her army and they set out. However, the sorceress Glinda, learns of her plans and magically transports Ann and her army across the Deadly Desert and out of Oz entirely.Meanwhile Betsy Bobbin, like Dorothy in Ozma of Oz, is lost at sea in a storm with her companion Hank the Mule. They are cast up on shore of the Rose Kingdom where they meet up with the Rose Princess, the Shaggy Man and Polychrome, the Rainbow's daughter. This group goes on a quest with the Shaggy Man who is seeking his lost brother, a prisoner of the Nome King. They meet up with Queen Ann's army and Tik-Tok. This large group decides to go in search of the Nome King together.Their quest leads them to the fairy kingdom of the great Jinjin, Tititi-Hoochoo where they meet a young dragon named Quox. Their encounter with the Nome King is terribly amusing and their search for the Shaggy Man's brother has a remarkable outcome.What starts out as a reworking of another story takes on a life of its own to become an entertaining and amusing story. The John R. Neill illustrations are wonderful and there are 12 full-page color plates. The end papers present the first published map of the land of Oz."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"I read Tik-Tok of Oz, and I thoght it was a wonderful tale. It begins when Ann Soforth, queen of Oogaboo decides to conquer Oz. When she sets out with her army towards the Emerald City, Glinda finds out immeadiately about it in her book of records. She then changes the army's road direction, over the deadly desert over to the Nome King's Dominions. Meanwhile, a girl named Betsy Bobbin and her mule Hank are shipwrecked on the shores of the Rose Kingdom after their ship sinks. They go to a nearby greenhouse, where a bunch of female roses cast them out. Then who should come crashing through the roof than the Shaggy Man. He and Betsy pick a rose princess, and proclaim her the new ruler of the Rose Kingdom. However, the roses don't wan't the rose girl, whose name is Ozga, as their ruler, so he to is cast out of the Rose Kingdom. They then travel over a bridge to the Nome Kings Dominions, where they find Tik-Tok crashed in a well. Then Queen Ann's Army comes along and tries to capture the party. The private then resigns, and Tik-Tok takes his place. Then the two parties band together, and go to conquer the Nome King, because they have to rescue Shaggy Man's brother from Ruggedo, the King of Nomes.

Anyways, this book is he greatest, and should be greatly praised."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"When L. Frank Baum set out to write and produce a second Oz musical for the stage, he discovered he had signed away the theatrical rights to his early Oz stories and characters. Apparently unwilling to create new material, Baum drafted a play that he called Tik - Tok Of Oz, which was simply a retelling of his third Oz novel, 1907's Ozma Of Oz, with some character names changed and minor plot elements rearranged. Since he owed publishers Reilly & Britton a new Oz book, Baum then rewrote his new play into a novel, and 1914's redundant Tik - Tok Of Oz was born.With such a circuitous pedigree, it's no wonder that Tik - Tok Of Oz is a generally unimpressive entry into the Oz chronicle. Baum was occasionally careless with his prestigious fairyland, and nothing suggests that here more than the fact that wind - up mechanical man Tik - Tok, though his name lights up the book's title, is only a secondary character in the narrative and often appears to be absent from much of the story, even when present in theory. In fact, the Tin Woodman or Jack Pumpkinhead could have replaced the clockwork man without altering the essential plot in the least. But the uncomplicated Tik - Tok was particularly useful in a lazily composed narrative, since, as a preprogrammed machine of limited potential in need of continuous winding, Baum could silence him at any time by simply having him run down, no dramatic action or mental fatigue required. Despite several warm and imaginatively written chapters, such as \`The Lovely Lady Of Light,' the book plods on without building in strength or imagination until its final section, when it suddenly awakens to life.Dorothy Gale doppelganger Betsy Bobbin, accompanied by sidekick Hank the Mule, reaches the shores of fairyland when a ship on which she is inexplicably a passenger explodes at sea. Baum's ho - hum attitude towards his material is immediately evident when introducing Betsy, who does indeed do some \\"bobbing\\" up and down on the waves and billows: \\"Suddenly the sea was lighted up by a vivid glare. The ship, now in the far distance, caught fire, blew up and sank beneath the waves.\\" No mention is made of the fate of the other passengers or of Betsy's guardians. Meanwhile, in the tiny northern Winkie kingdom of Oogaboo, irritable queen Ann Soforth ('And so forth') has decided to conquer all of Oz through the use of her army, which consists of four Colonels, four Captains, four Generals, four Majors and one soldier. The third plot thread finds the Shaggy Man tramping across Oz in search of his missing brother, who he believes has been captured by the Nome King. Ozma, concerned about the Shaggy Man's progress, sends Tik - Tok to assist him, though he promptly gets thrown down a well.Potentially interesting new character Princess Ozga, a beautiful vegetable woman grown from a rose bush, remains underdeveloped and underutilized, while the apparently always - on - standby Polychrome strays from the rainbow yet again, and acts, here as elsewhere, as a convenient deus ex machina whenever Baum writes himself into a tight corner. To his credit, Baum allows Polychrome a little more common sense and perception than she reveals in other titles. Arch Oz villain Ruggedo, whose original name was Roquat before he drank from the \`Waters of Oblivion,' is alternately called the Metal Monarch or the Nome (Gnome) King, while on the other side of the planet readers are introduced to the \\"Famous Fellowship of Fairies,\\" which is overseen by the Jinjin, who is also known as the Private Citizen and as Tititi - Hoochoo, a name which must have delighted grade school boys and irked educators for decades. Readers never learn the true name of Shaggy Man's brother, but, when he is not referred to as such, is simply called the Ugly One due to a punishing enchantment Ruggedo has cast upon him. Like the Little Wizard and Dorothy and Captain Bill and Trot, the Shaggy Man and Betsy eventually form a partnership: elderly man - little girl relationships lacking blood ties are common in the Oz chronicle.A good indicator of a weak Baum title is an absence of imaginative description, as readers will find here. Baum's Nome Kingdom might have been wondrously described, as E. T. A. Hoffman detailed his own underground fairyland in 'The Mines of Falun.' Hoffman's underground caves, mines, and tunnels emit a claustrophobia readers can feel, a strange otherworldly magic that is both threatening and powerfully seductive. Once Baum establishes that his characters are underground, except for a brief scene in a metal forest, readers are left to visualize the rocky, gem - rich nome world as best they can, or rely wholly on John R. Neill's humorous illustrations.In an apparent mistake on Baum's part, sorceress Glinda the Good's castle on the far boundary of the southern kingdom of the Quadlings is said to \\"stand far north of the Emerald City where Ozma holds her court,\\" despite the two comprehensive maps which open and close the book and demonstrate that the castle rightly stands in the red southern kingdom of the Quadlings where it should.Oz newcomers beware: Tik - Tok Of Oz reads much like the uninspired retread it is; like the clockwork man himself, the book is sorely in need of additional winding under its left arm. Baum should have saved the few good ideas he introduced here for his next entirely new manuscript. This is one of the few Baum - authored books in the Oz series which readers may decide to put aside before finishing."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"A few months before the publication and huge success of The Patchwork Girl of Oz, L. Frank Baum loosely adapted his Ozma of Oz and The Road To Oz novels into a stage play titled The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. When the time came for an eight installment for the Oz stories, Baum adapted the play into what would become 1914's Tik-Tok of Oz. In the brief preface, he once again thanks his readers for enjoying his stories and informs them that Dorothy's come through with yet another tale via \\"the wireless\\".The story begins in Oogaboo, a small valley in the far corner of Oz ruled by Queen Ann Soforth. Dissatisified with her tiny monarchy made of \\"eighteen men, twenty-seven women and forty-four children\\" and jealous of Princess Ozma's vast kingdom, Ann gathers together an army of seventeen men to conquer the Emerald City. However the Good Witch Glinda is already aware of their plans thanks to her magic Record Book and uses her powers to guide the measly \\"army\\" in the opposite direction.Meanwhile Oklahoma girl Betsy Bobbin is shipwrecked with her mule Hank and the two find themselves in the Rose Kingdom, home to snobby, self-centered roses of various colors. The Royal Gardener, the only human allowed in the domain, is ordered to execute Betsy and Hank when the Shaggy Man falls through the roof of the greenhouse and uses his trusty Love Magnet to save them. Unfortunately it doesn't work on the heartless roses and Betsy plucks the Rose Princess Ozga before they're thrown out. Shaggy explains to his new friends that he's on a journey to find his brother who's gone missing since digging underground. Seeing as the Nome King hates it when humans come anywhere near his home, it's surmised that he's kidnapped him. Along the way they meet Polychrome (the Rainbow's daughter who's slid off her father's bow once again), rescue Tik-Tok from a well the Nome King tossed him in, and join forces with Queen Ann and her army.The terrible Metal Monarch knows of their quest and tries to stop them. They're soon cast into the Hollow Tube where they find themselves on the other side of the world. Tititi-Hoochoo the Great Jinjin aka the Private Citizen is angered by the King's actions and sends the travelers back the other way via the back of a dragon named Quox for a face-off with the Nome and his cronies.Does the plot sound familiar? It should since it's a copy of Ozma of Oz and a poor one at that. My biggest beef with this installment is how underdeveloped the new characters are. Queen Ann starts off as a slightly bratty girl with the unrealistic ambition of overthrowing Ozma, but quickly becomes an utter annoyance I cared little for. Little Betsy's sweet enough, but she's a total knock-off of Dorothy and Hank is useless. I almost forgot Ozga was even a part of the story, she was barely there and the same goes for Tik-Tok. Although his name is in the title, he's sorely underused.Then there are the continuity issues. Polychrome and the Shaggy Man had already met and traveled together to the Emerald City in The Road to Oz, but they're complete strangers to each other here. In that same novel it's said that one only needs the Love Magnet on their person for it to work, but in Tik-Tok it has to be physically shown or its power is useless. Minor issues maybe, but they're unnecessary and avoidable.On the positive side, Baum's knack for holding the reader's attention is still there. Even when I found myself rolling my eyes at the obvious rip-offs of past (and better) Oz stories, I was never bored. John R. Neill is back with his colorfully alluring illustrations and includes a beautifully detailed map of Oz and its neighboring countries in the book's endpapers.Apparently Baum's fans were also unpleased by Tik-Tok of Oz at the time of its release since it sold 3,000 copies fewer than its predecessor The Patchwork Girl of Oz. Fortunately The Royal Historian of Oz would get his groove back with The Scarecrow of Oz."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"In the Land of Oz, where animals talk and logic is delightfully warped and fairies mingle with mortals and clockwork men, Betsy Bobbin and her mule Hank are shipwrecked. Along with Queen Ann's army, Polychrome, the Shaggy Man, Ozga (the Rose Princess), and Tik Tok, Betsy and Hank find themselves on a rescue mission for Shaggy's brother imprisoned by the selfish Nome King.

The Marvelous Land of Oz and The Tin Woodman of Oz are still the strongest in the series. Grade: B"},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"I teach creative writing to children and have used this book as an excellent model for the fantasy genre. It has all the great elements of a fantasy story--strange and enchanted happenings, magical creatures, faeries, and a wonderful quest. Many of Baum's books are not so plot-driven; this, like \\"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\\" is an exception, and the story works marvelously. Fans of the Oz series will know that this book is a re-telling of \\"Ozma of Oz,\\" but there are enough new characters, settings, and details to make it a fresh and rewarding tale. Certainly, old favorites such as Tik-Tok, the Nome King, Polychrome, and the Shaggy Man are at their best in this tale (one of the most delightful scenes is when Shaggy \\"breaks the law\\"), while new additions Private Files and Quox the Dragon bring much humor and whimsy. Young children will certainly enjoy the test of the three maidens towards the end of the book. This books has a very cohesive direction (not always the case with Baum) and I especially enjoyed how each chapter title is alliterative (I suppose that's the English Lit in me!). And, as usual, the John R. Neil's illustrations are wonderful; my favorite illustration is that of the greedy Nome King strutting out of his kingdom, his countless pockets filled with jewels."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"Tik-Tok of Oz is one of the best books in the Wizard of Oz series!

Frank Baum introduces this book -- the eighth in the Oz series -- by explaining that he's been consulting with our beloved Dorothy over the \\"wireless.\\" Well, this was a \\"wireless\\" of a century ago, 1914 to be exact, but that doesn't in any way lessen the appeal of Baum's imaginative tales.Here, he brings back Tik-Tok, the tubby little Clockwork Man, as well as the Shaggy Man. They're part of the force for good in this book, for it seems a little evil has sprung up in a far corner of Oz. Queen Ann of Oogaboo is quite bored with her tiny kingdom and fancies she could perhaps conquer the Land of Oz and rule in the place of its fair Princess Ozma. So off Ann goes with her small army.A young girl named Betsy, meanwhile, gets shipwrecked with her mule, Hank, effectively getting mixed into these adventures and, of course, finding her way to Oz. Baum alliterates every chapter title for a little something different in this one: Betsy Braves the Billows, Tik-Tok Tackles a Tough Task, etc. And his usual delightful brand of creative elements are there, this time bringing us the Rose Kingdom and its exiled princess, as well as the Queen of Light and her maidens, Sunlight, Moonlight, Starlight, Daylight, Firelight and Electra."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"I started reading this series with my son back in October. He turned 4 in June and we'd just started reading chapter books in the fall and I was looking for great stories without the presence of annoying pop culture. The Oz books were recommended by a trusted friend and I was skeptical at first, especially at his age, but the first book is so much better than the movie, and each subsequent book has been better than the last. After checking a couple different versions out from the library we now make sure to always get the books with the original illustrations by John R.

They are so well made and make a wonderful library addition for young children. Couldn't be more pleased with the quality."},{"Title":"Tik-Tok of Oz","review":"It's funny what stays with you from books.First of all, let me say that I'm aware that Tik Tok of Oz is generally considered to be a weak Oz book. There are a number of character inconsistencies. Betsy is a poor Dorothy substitute. The Shaggy Man and Polychrome have met each other before this. Reading this as a grown-up who is currently re-reading the whole series, I see these errors and acknowledge the point.Still, I have to say that as a child, this was one of the Oz books that stuck with me the most strongly. First of all, Polychrome was one of my favorite Oz characters, and I loved every book in which she made an appearance. Second of all, I was secretly quite sympathetic with Ann of Oogaboo. Even at a young age I wasn't very fond of Ozma, absolute ruler. Third of all, I was absolutely fascinated with the Rose Princess, and the idea of a royal family grown on vines. I was heartbroken on behalf of poor Ozga by the reception of her subjects. Something about that bit stayed with me quite strongly, entering my personal mythology.I do think that the plot is reasonably well-formed in this book, compared to others in the series. While adults may take issue with some of the errors, there are many aspects that I believe would appeal strongly to children. At least, I can say that it certainly appealed strongly to me. As a kid I was reading these from the library, and I must have checked this particular book out twenty times.

Contemporary relationships between departments, workers, and managers are clearly articulated and are accurately described. Management, production control and material management functions are described in great detail, and reflect current operating practices in many organizations, both large and small.The story is told from the perspective of a Manufacturing Engineer (Sandy) from the fictional Garrett Gear Company, and chronicles efforts to build a set of garage shelves using traditional batch manufacturing techniques. The work team is comprised of volunteers from Garrett Gear and others recruited by 'Joe' (VP of Manufacturing at Garrett). This is also the story of how Sandy is introduced to WCM techniques, aided by his neighbor and counterpart, Ralph Morita of Yamachi Gear (a competitor to Garrett).This book will have a varying value to readers, depending on their background and position in their organization. There is nothing to be gained by senior or middle management, while first line supervisors may be able to decipher the &quot;how NOT to's&quot; and translate them into &quot;how to's&quot;. Both supervisors and shop floor workers can benefit by relating to situations presented and recognizing wastes introduced BY the manufacturing process.While the book is quick to point out flaws in current mass/batch production techniques, it comes up short in terms of solid solutions that can be implemented by supervisors or workers. The work contains several logical flaws, including comparing the industrial manufacturing environment to a home project, which may be akin to comparing capital costing in terms of a household budget. Others include stabs at unions, traditional production measurements, quality personnel, specific management structures, etc...The book espouses several 'lean production' techniques, which will be useful to any reader. It contains many simple and easy-to-remember phrases that can be used as idea 'seeds' on the shop floor. The glossary is an EXCELLENT reference which I recommend highly.In short, I recommend the book for shop floor personnel and first line leaders, but not for the purpose for which it was intended. I recommend the book as part of the cultural change process, which is a precursor to (or perhaps parallels) any WCM/Lean Manufacturing effort. This book will open minds to possibilities that may not have been previously explored in traditionally structured organizations, and may be used best in conjunction with The Day I Learned About Quality in Joe's Garage: High Quality Made Simple, and Manufacturing Beyond Joe's Garage: Value Based Manufacturing (both works by Wm. B. Miller, not yet available)."},{"Title":"All I Need to Know about Manufacturing I Learned in Joe's Garage : World Class Manufacturing Made Simple","review":"The electronics industry requires rapid product development, quick turnaround on orders, low inventory and manufacturing costs, and high quality to satisfy customers in the face of cut-throat competition.

It is actually about management strategy, i.e. how to run the business, and how to communicate that in a way that everybody in a business will understand and buy into. The book also shows how to deploy the strategies into specific world class manufacturing techniques. It has complete, and clear, descriptions of all key world class management tactics.

Its main problem is that it stopped short of attaining this goal. Coming as it does on the verge of the third decade of America's realization that the American Production System is not the ultimate manufacturing system it highlighted manufacturing problems, but not their solutions. The idea behind the book was excellent. Building a neighborhood project within a close neighborhood highlighted problems with the common American Mfg. system. It allowed one to easily attain the concept and the Japanese catch-word that defines the solution. If you want a book that will help you relate catch-words this is it. If you are interested in a solution, search elsewhere. It needs a little further development on the reverse side of the coin. Such as the following week the group should have had a project at Ralph's or Sato's garage and with the same style demonstrate how the project should have been handled. I did not like this book because it is only one side of the story.

The depiction of American manufacturing in the pamphlet is getting old. American managers have grown tired of hearing how a Japanese approach is superior and of needing to use terms such as kaizen and poka-yoke when talking about lean thinking. If the Japanese approach is so superior, why are many manfacturing companies have trouble competing in today's global market? This approach can get in the way of adoption of lean thinking. Many of the terms in the glossary are not used in the book.On the positive side the book does provide a number of bad practices, management and production."},{"Title":"All I Need to Know about Manufacturing I Learned in Joe's Garage : World Class Manufacturing Made Simple","review":"this is a great teaching tool, an easy read but drive the point home!

It was supposed to enlighten us into the world of lean manufacturing. Instead, it simply painted a distorted picture of one manufacturing philosophy and how it was better than another. The stage was set early when the character &quot;Joe&quot; was made out to be a difficult boss, someone not sophisticated and rough. This slanted the reading from comparing processes to comparing personalities. In addition, assumptions were made that employees in Ralph's company had the ability to improve their manufacturing processes on the fly (page 18). Supposedly this was a good thing, but it never referenced how to go about doing this and fitting into an ISO environment or how much paperwork that would have involved.In any event this book should not be taken very seriously. It is a story with little substance that raises two significant points. The first is if George Washington screamed when Joe squeezed a nickel....what happened to Thomas Jefferson must have been really bad.(Page 14) And if Joe actually got 20 people to show up to his house on a Saturday to help him build shelves in his garage....shouldn't he really be in sales?"},{"Title":"All I Need to Know about Manufacturing I Learned in Joe's Garage : World Class Manufacturing Made Simple","review":"Another book fawning all over Toyota and the Japanese as being the absolute masters of production.

For all of the 1950's and most of the 1960's, \\"Made in Japan\\" was not a good thing to see on a product. Only in the past 30 years have they gotten good.

When the book was in process the world really knew little about Linux and the average business decision maker knew even less. Netware, OS/2, and Windows for Workgroups ruled the day and that's what corporate decision makers were used to. Those tools had significant vendor support in training, manuals, and for pay support.In the 90's Linux introduced a new paradigm (obligatory business speak) that said \\"You have control\\". It broke the absolute dependance on the vendor for support resolution and new code fixes. It provided tools that required creativity and imagination to use, not just another training class. Business leaders needed to know what was there for them and Marcus sought to give them an introduction that covered several possible needs.The world has changed, and for the better, in my not overly humble opinion.

A string of winning championships have won him the town's acclaim. But the one person he is really interested in seeing again does not welcome him back with open arms.Peg Lathrop knew that forever just was not something Cutter has to give. She never intended to tame his free spirit, but she is certainly not ready to repeat that summer of six years ago. She lives with the consequences every day, and while she would not change a thing, her heart cannot survive a second onslaught.In TAMING THE OUTLAW, author Cindy Gerard dazzles readers with heart rendering situations and deeply emotional characters. Peg bears the wounds of a loving and leaving rodeo man; Cutter does not even know the consequences of their short time together six years ago. Peg knows better than to try to lasso a rodeo man; Cutter does not believe he has what it takes to be a stable, stay at home kind of guy. Yet together they create magic that leaves them both longing for more. Add this one to your keep keeper shelf! TAMING THE OUTLAW earns the Winner of the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"Taming the Outlaw (Man of the Month)","review":"Written in 2002 I picked up this quickie Harlequin romance because I'm such a huge fan of Cindy Gerard's Bodyguard and BOI's series. Unlike her newer stuff, TAMING THE OUTLAW is a straight up contemporary romance, theres no real suspense here, no bad guys and nobody gets kidnapped. Gerard's hero also doesn't get shot at or blow anything up. Instead we get a sexy, somewhat emotionally tortured rodeo star, a jaded single mother and a reacquainted lovers theme, all set in Sundown Montana's cattle country.Initially this story didn't grab me, it was just kind of blah (please, somebody shoot something) but then about halfway in the heroine grew a back bone, got some personality and made things interesting. And Cutter the hero, well he let his emotions loose, big time and in a couple of \\"awww\\" moments captured my heart, as all of Gerard's men eventually do. Damn she's good with the anguished/I'm too damaged/not good enough for you heroes. So even though this wasn't the Gerard I'm used to it was still a sweet, uncomplicated little read with a handsome cowboy, some hot lovin and lots of horses.Cutter Reno always knew that one day he'd drift back into Sundown Montana; he just never expected it to be as grand marshal of the Forth of July parade. But after 6 years on the rodeo circuit and a recent winning streak he's now a local celebrity. Unfortunately the one person he really wants to see again wants nothing to do with him. It seems pretty Peg Lathrop hasn't forgotten about that intoxicating summer they spent together either, however she's older and wiser now and darn if she ain't a mama too.Peg knew that forever wasn't in the cards with someone as wild and untameable as Cutter Reno, his spirit belonged to the open road and the rodeo. But a little goodbye would have gone a long way because when Cutter left he unknowingly took her heart with him and left a little piece of himself behind. Peg's never healed from those wounds and there ain't no way she's letting this smooth talkin cowboy back into her life, never mind into her bed. Yet Cutter swears he's a changed man, ready to settle into a home on the range complete with wife and child. Only thing is Peg can still see the flight reflex written all over his face, even if he can't.Will Cutter cowboy up and become the kind of man both Meg and her daughter need? Or will this footloose freebird hit the road again without ever realizing that he is worthy of love and that together they can break the cycle of desertion and loss that has already altered both of their lives.

TNOF offers a rundown of Japanese populist heroes from the past 2,000 years - all of whom are doomed to complete and utter failure - and provides a convincing analysis of why Japanese culture produces such men, and why their failures actually raise their status in the eyes of many of their fellow citizens.Morris was perhaps the leading Japan scholar of his day, but even he finds many of his subjects bizaare.

Morris is eloquent and concise, and his work is thoroughly researched (almost half of this study's pages are notes and references - truly a treasure trove for researchers). I find a lot of the myths really compelling, and the conclusions Morris draws are right on the money. His thesis is relatively simple: Japan idolizes and remembers it's historic failures much more than successes. There's something about being committed to an ideal or a cause to the bitter end, even if it's wrong, that resonates strongly with the warrior culture of Japan. But not just there, I think that in contemporary American culture, with its attraction to whimsy, instantaneous gratification, and billion channel satellites, there can be found a certain respect for people who can commit themselves solidly to a cause. There's something romantic about lost causes in general that I think people identify with, the almost types of stories get embedded in our culture as well (here I'm thinking of Rudy).A good read for a piece of dense and thorough scholarship."},{"Title":"The nobility of failure: Tragic heroes in the history of Japan","review":"I first read this book in the 1970s and have reread it several times.Initially I had trouble understanding the concept of the \\"failed hero,\\" as I am an American, but learning about this broadened my viewpoint.The book reads like five or six novels -- each failed hero has a detailed back story filled with intrigue, romance, rivalries within the Japanese imperial family, battles, assassinations, political conflicts, religious concerns, suicides -- never a dull moment. I learned so much about Japanese culture and history from this book.You do not need to know anything about Japanese history, literature or language to enjoy the book.

The author, professor Ivan Morris, is said to have written the book partially to place Mishima's suicide within Japan's historical context of failed heroes.The fact that the book deals with tragic heroes who were mostly executed or exiled has additional poignance for me from my discovery that Professor Morris died in 1976, shortly after the book was published."},{"Title":"The nobility of failure: Tragic heroes in the history of Japan","review":"I lived in Japan for two and a half years, have visited the country several times since, and cannot speak highly enough of this book.In TNOF, Ivan Morris provides a much-needed look at - to most westerners, anyway - one of the oddest aspects of Japanese culture, the self-immolating hero. TNOF offers a rundown of Japanese populist heroes from the past 2,000 years - all of whom are doomed to complete and utter failure - and provides a convincing analysis of why Japanese culture produces such men, and why their failures actually raise their status in the eyes of many of their fellow citizens.Morris was perhaps the leading Japan scholar of his day, but even he finds many of his subjects bizaare. He deftly, though not necessarily disrespectfully, pokes fun at the absurdity of many of their situations. Not many scholars can make you laugh while they make you think."},{"Title":"The nobility of failure: Tragic heroes in the history of Japan","review":"\\"La Nobleza Del Fracaso es el &uacute;ltimo de los grandes libros de ese erudito cuya muerte prematura constituye una p&eacute;rdida grande para todo aficionado a la historia y a la literatura japonesas\\".Marguerite Yourcenar."},{"Title":"Women, Art and Geometry in Southern Africa","review":"Extremely inspirational.

But the fact is that many books are all the same. They start with a nice little example that everyone knows: class Hello{ public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;); }} I think Jamie does a superb job. And for you beginners: This is a book with alot of code examples, such as the Black Jack Game! And I can tell you the code is well structured and follows an appropriate code standard. There are many nice exaples, like the complete HTTP Web Server, etc.So if you know something about programming, and if you want to explore some interesting things in Java, this book IS very nice.There are comments enough in this book for you people who at least have a clue about programming!

I thought it was a book that actually HAD chapters for the beginner when I bought the book, but nope, the author was serious when saying 'experts only'. So, do NOT buy this book if you're a newbie.This doesn't mean all experts should buy the book, though. The 60-70 pages on Swing are a perfect example of how Swing should NOT be introduced. The same stands for thread deprecation.To summarize, only buy this book if you're interested in EITHER the enterprise APIs OR Java2D / non-standard API's (e.g. JavaMail).Werner Zsolt"},{"Title":"Java 1.2 Unleashed","review":"This is a comparative review - Java 1.2 Unleashed is compared to other four Java 2 books, namely:Horstmann - Cornell: Core Java 1.2 (4th ed, Core series, Sunpress/ Pr. Hall, 1999)Peter van der Linden: Just Java 1.2 (4th ed, Core series, Sunpress/ Pr. Hall, 1999)Bruce Eckel: Thinking in Java (with the new chapter on Collections).Aaron Walsh: Java 1.2 Bible (IDG Press, 1998).I cover all the important areas of the books. Don't forget only the first volume of Core Java has been published. In the table below, I used parentheses to evaluate the corresponding chapter in vol2, 3rd edition of the book. Don't let these remarks mislead you - I'm only referring to the 3rd edition, NOT the forthcoming 4th one! Let's hope vol2 of 4th edition will be even better than the prev one (and also contain ALL the swing widgets and everything about Java 2D)To summarize:- The comprehensibility of OOP's discussion is outstanding in Just Java 1.2. All the other books are far worse in this respect. If you don't understand a word of the other 4 books' OOP chapters, give a try to Linden's book. Unfortunately, Linden's book is far more superficial than either Core Java or Thinking in Java. It's its being extremely comprehensive that makes it worth the money.- All these books are particularly weak as far as Swing widgets are concerned. The only exception is Core Java. This book doesn't cover many widgets (only the basic ones), but is very thorough. Let's hope vol2 will cover all the missing widgets and the reader won't be referred to Topley's Core Java Foundation Classes.- IDG's Java 1.2 Bible and Java 1.2 Unleashed plain sucks. The former is just a compendium with a lot of mistakes (the biggest error is that it says we synchronize on a method, so 2 or more threads can't call the same METHOD. It doesn't even mention wait()/notify(). The latter, Java 1.2 Unleashed, has nothing to offer to beginners. I hoped Jaworski would write a much better book (his 1.1. dev handbook was quite cool). His book just sucks, it covers a lot of additional, non-basic 1.2 APIs, while the discussion of basic (Swing, Java 2D) APIs is very bad.- Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java could be much better. It indeed has outstanding chapters (inner classes, reflection etc) but discussing Swing just sucks. You indeed should get the book, but don't expect to become a Swing programmer after reading it. The same stands for the emphasis on the 1.0 event model - most AWT components are presented using the 1.0 event model. It's indeed a bad move from Eckel. Nobody wants to learn / code the old event model any more."},{"Title":"Java 1.2 Unleashed","review":"Maybe only 20% of this heavy book contains useful information. It mentions almost every feature of Java, but that's the problem -- it ONLY mentions most of them. It is helpful with the Java 1.2 Swing library, since many older books do not cover that much at all.I've referred to it for information I cannot find in other books, but it does not provide a full explanation, and I end up looking elsewhere for a more complete understanding."},{"Title":"Java 1.2 Unleashed","review":"A real disappointment (as are most books on this subject).

It is especially good at explaining Mormon family life, and the many admirable traits of the Mormons are well documented. The explanation of the Mormon theology was even handed, quite detailed, and very eye-opening. I found discussion of the controversies which dog this religion (racism, second class status for women, etc) somewhat superficial. One criticism about the writing of the book: I found the almost constant tips \\"for more on this see Chapter 7\\", \\"for a full explanation see Section6\\", etc extremely annoying and distracting. For those readers who wish to know more about this up to now somewhat mysterious religion, this is a good primer. if somewhat biased since it was written by two practicing Mormons."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"There are other good reviews here that discuss why this book is so good. I will only add what they didn't cover.My favorite part of the book was when the authors covered cultural and sociological issues, such as retention and attendance rate. For example, did you know that Mormon attendance on Sundays in the USA/Canada is only about 50%? I was really surprised by that. For some reason I thought it would be a little bit higher. (In the USA/Canada, weekly attendance is about 83 to 87 percent for English Jehovah's Witness congregations. The attendance is higher for foreign language congregations in those countries. Jehovah's Witnesses are frequently mistaken for Mormons and vice versa.) The book, \\"Leaving the Fold\\", written by a Mormon, sheds some light on the situation.They joked about Mormon parents buying their kids cars so that the young men would become missionaries, but that the Mormon church is now stricter about getting \\"worthy\\" candidates for missionary service. Although I knew that young single women can also become missionaries, I didn't know that some retired Mormon couples also serve as missionaries.My interest in the Mormon religion stems from the fact that I've been mistaken as one. I'm actually one of Jehovah's Witnesses now and I would never become Mormon. I simply disagree with their theological beliefs and teachings about the Bible.For example, the authors admit that Joseph Smith made corrections to the King James Version of the Bible and gave some examples where this occurs. They explained that their version of the KJV Bible is the only accepted one by the Mormon church authorities but that they didn't know why the LDS honchos don't accept modern day translations that are based on modern day discoveries of older parchments and scrolls. I'm referring in particular to the Dead Sea Scrolls. All the authors say is that the modern day Bible translations are not acceptable to the LDS church honchos. To my ears, this sounds like a convenient way for the Mormons to keep saying \\"we believe the Bible only as far as it's been accurately translated.\\" For example, many mainstream Christians, while acknowledging the beautiful language of the archaic English used in the KJV Bible, prefer using a modern English Bible that is based on older and more accurate scrolls/parchments. That's why they printed the New King James Version of the Bible.The old KJV Bible was printed in the year 1611 CE. Since then, many more ancient Bible scrolls/parchments have been discovered that correct the flaws in this version of the Bible. It will be interesting to see if other ancient parchments will come to light in the near future.At any rate, this book is excellent for anyone who wants a reasonably comprehensive view of the biggest Mormon sect from a devout Mormon point of view.P.S. I surmise a Mormon/LDS Christian is more likely to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses than vice versa. I personally know several Jehovah's Witness households that are ex-LDS/Mormons, but not vice versa."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I bought this as a gift for my friend who recently moved to Salt Lake City and it not a Mormon. I hope he too finds it interesting, well organized and gives him an overview of this religion."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"What I appreciate the most about the \\"Idiot\\" and \\"Dummies\\" books are that most of the time, they provide a great overview on a wide range of interesting subjects. I never saw these books to be the only resources available, but, they are great to initiate further study if desired, or at least give enough data to provide an interactive conversation with a person more exposed in the area of interest. I am a solitary Pagan who tries to take time to read about different faiths; not for personal conversion, but, to see where people are coming from with they stem from different faiths than what I am familiar with.This book on Mormonism has provided that for me. It has nice comparative charts on the differences between Mormonism and mainstream Christianity, information on some of the origins of their beliefs and provides resources for further reading. NO religion is totally right or wrong. What most people are looking for is a basic understanding. Even if you found the book to be inaccurate, it can STILL give information to initiate a conversation with a follower of Mormonism, and all that follower can do is explain their view from THEIR experience. At least it leave fertile ground for discussion. And, if you are interested in reading more or visiting with them, you can if you wish. I highlighted so many areas on my Kindle Fire to discuss with my best friend, who also likes to discuss different philosphies and religion."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Pros: well written, really funny at times, easy to read and through.Cons: Paints a pretty rosy picture of the polygamy period.This is a really well written overview of the Mormon Church, Very through and honest, it gives non-Mormons a clear picture of what today's LDS practice and believe. I have family member who are Mormon and the book is a valuable tool to help understand how they live their lives. The authors don't shy away from controversy, explaining in more detail than I expected the differences between Mormon faith and other Christian churches. I was a little surprised at the detail provided regarding Temple ordinances, while not explaining exactly what is done, the authors explain what the services are and why they are done. Any differences between Mormon and traditional Christianity are explained away by continuing Revelation and that in their view, the LDS church is the one true faith. Not a problem for me, the book is written by Mormons to explain their church to non Mormons.Given the level of honesty in the book I was a little surprised at the coverage of polygamy. If the authors are correct, most women were very happy being one of several wives. There is a page that tells how many sister wives were doctors, teachers, and other professionals. They do admit that while polygamy is now forbidden by the church the revelation that encouraged it has never been withdrawn, and that many in the church expect that polygamy will be the norm in the 3 levels of Heaven (read the book). In their favor they do admit that during the time of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young girls as young as 14 were taken as wives.If you are looking for a layman's guide to the Mormon faith, I highly recommend Mormonism For Dummies.."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Good book. Learned a lot about our faith and what others thought. Thank you.Karen Kay Ullom"},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I am a Mormon and I can tell you that this is probably the worst book to understand our faith. I gave it 2 stars because it at least attempts to explain our beliefs, but it leaves out soooo much detail that is actually pretty essential to fully understanding certain concepts.Like, for example, in chapter 1 it talks about \\"LIFE BEFORE MORTAL LIFE\\"... it says that \\"Mormons believe that God created spiritual bodies to house each person's eternal essence...\\" hahaha I'm sorry, this totally made me laugh & smile. Ok, so we believe that we lived before this earth life - yes - but there is no such thing as a \\"spiritual body\\". hahaha Spirits do not have bodies! They are spirits! :P One of the big reasons why we came to this earth was to RECEIVE a physical body... because we did not have them in the pre-existence. (Which is another laughable thing... in the book it says, \\"Premortality, as Mormons call this stage...\\" I have NEVER heard one Mormon call the pre-existence: \\"premortality\\". hahaha) But then that begs the question: Why do we need or want a physical body? Why did we even leave Heaven in the first place?! What is the purpose of coming down to earth?? The core answer is because we desired to be like our Heavenly Father, and He has a physical body - a glorified, perfected one. But we didn't just want to have a body, we wanted to become LIKE Heavenly Father. In other words, we wanted to become Gods & Goddesses too. But it's not easy to become a God... it's hard work! Not everyone is cut out for the job. But Heavenly Father is more than willing to help us attain our goal. Think of our earth life as a \\"spiritual bootcamp\\"... It's gonna challenge you in ways you never thought possible. You'll have to do exercises you don't always like. It's pushes you to the limit - mind/body/spirit. But guess what? If you work hard in bootcamp what usually ends up happening? You get stronger! You get smarter! You become a better version of yourself. And if you can pass through bootcamp you get to join the ranks, right? Well, similar concept... Now, something that really bothered me about \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" explanation of this test is that they say, \\"Those who pass the test with flying colors get the chance to eventually start an eternal family like God's.\\" Pass with flying colors?? I'm sorry, that's implying some sort of perfectionism which is IMPOSSIBLE to obtain in this life. We are IMPERFECT beings by nature (because of the fall of Adam). We make mistakes all the time, we sin all the time, and that's ok! God doesn't expect us to be perfect. All Heavenly Father wants to see is PROGRESS and part of progression is CHANGE. Part of changing is through REPENTANCE and with repentance we can move FORWARD in life and get one step closer to becoming like Christ. This begs the question: What is Repentance? Is it just saying \\"sorry\\"? In a nutshell, remember the concept \\"actions speak louder than words\\". Repentance is when you GENUINELY feel sorry and you change your actions to reflect this apology. So, for example, if you have a problem with stealing, God expects you to show you're sorry by not stealing anymore. Sounds simple, but if you have, say, an addiction it might not be. And that's ok! You can obtain forgiveness of your sin or addiction through Christ's atonement and you have the Holy Ghost to help you make better choices. But anyway...What irks me about \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" is that it speaks in a very \\"worldly\\" manner... meaning, there is absolutely no \\"spiritual understanding\\" in any of their descriptions. Which is kind of funny... How do you expect to truly learn about a religion if you take all spiritual understanding out of it? The way this book words everything makes it all sound like a fairytale instead of something that is real and that people actual BELIEVE in. Also, in their attempts to be light-hearted or humorous in their descriptions, the authors' come off being condescending and rude towards Mormons - which I don't appreciate.I dunno, if you want to learn about ANY religion, it's much better to ask the source than a 3rd party. Check out www. mormon.org if you'd like to ACTUALLY learn about the LDS church and what Mormons believe in. The site does an excellent job at breaking down our foundational beliefs into easy-to-understand sections... it's really cool!

However, that lingo hasn't exactly caught on, even at the daily Salt Lake newspaper owned by the Church.\\" (Pg. 16)\\"Mormons believe that God the Father underwent a test much like this earthly one, which they argue doesn't deny his eternal nature because ALL individuals have always existed, in one form or another...\\" (Pg. 18)\\"Does that mean that single people can't enter the highest level of the celestial kingdom? Well ... LDS leaders assure righteous, unmarried Church members that they won't be denied any blessings in the hereafter. Some Mormons believe that these people may have the opportunity to marry in the afterlife.\\" (Pg. 37)\\"Mormons believe that God has a better half. He's eternally married to a glorified, deified women who's known as 'Heavenly Mother,' with whom he has spirit children. Most Mormons discuss their spiritual mother only rarely and briefly...\\" (Pg. 41)\\"In the Mormon view, God fathered everybody's spirit, but the Savior's PHYSICAL body was the only one literally procreated by God, in partnership with the mortal Mary.\\" (Pg. 46)\\"Mormons believe that Jesus Christ ... must've gotten married at some point... some Mormons believe that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had children... However, modern Church leaders pretty much publicly avoid this subject altogether.\\" (Pg. 47)\\"Mormon theology hasn't offered a definitive statement about the origins and identity of the Holy Ghost... As one Mormon Apostle explained, God hasn't yet given revelation on the Spirit's origin or destiny, and debating it is 'speculative and fruitless.'\\" (Pg. 53)\\"The Church has carefully downplayed this last point in its official history, but the fact is certainly true that, like many other Americans of this period, Joseph Smith was involved in treasure seeking.\\" (Pg. 62)\\"Mormonism is adamantly, unapologetically patriarchal.\\" (Pg. 72)\\"Mormons uphold traditional gender roles. Ideally, men earn the money so women can stay home with the kids. However, U.S. demographics show that Mormon women work outside the home just as much as non-Mormon women do.\\" (Pg. 76)\\"Mormons are a bit puzzled by the hullabaloo (about their proxy baptism for Jewish victims of the Holocaust), because proxy baptism doesn't MAKE the baptized person Mormon or force a spirit world conversion---it just provides deceased spirits with the CHOICE.\\" (Pg. 79)\\"One has to ask, 'Why doesn't the LDS Church just go ahead and publish an edition of the Bible that fully incorporates Joseph Smith's corrections?' Perhaps one answer ... (is that) If the missionaries used a version of the Bible rewritten by Joseph Smith, mainstream Christians would be quicker to dismiss it.\\" (Pg. 156)\\"Although Mormons today carefully read, quote from, and research the Book of Mormon, they haven't always done so... the LDS emphasis on reading and studying the Book of Mormon is actually rather new.\\" (Pg. 169)\\"Although the Articles of Faith touch on several important aspects of Mormonism, they ... don't say anything about humankind's premortal existence, the performance of gospel ordinances for the dead, eternal marriage, or humankind's potential to become like Heavenly Father.\\" (Pg. 175)\\"So what happens when the teachings of LDS prophets seem to collide? ... a living prophet always trumps a dead prophet.\\" (Pg. 183)\\"Unfortunately, the Church ... chose to cover up the evidence of the (Mountain Meadows) massacre for years, blaming Native Americans even when Mormon involvement was obvious.\\" (Pg. 220)\\"...anecdotal evidence and surveys suggest that black converts in the United States have a low retention rate, a possible indication that African American members' initial enthusiasm for the gospel diminishes when they find out about Mormonism's racially troubled history or don't adjust well into white-dominated Mormon culture.\\" (Pg. 255)\\"One thing you don't normally see in Mormon circles is the group Bible study beyond Sunday school class, as you do in most Protestant and some Catholic churches.\\" (Pg. 296)"},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I am not Mormon but I wanted to learn as much as I could about the LDS faith in as short a period of time as possilbe.

The study of American history often omits the driving force of various religious denominations that defined and divided the inheritors of the American Revolution. I enjoy studying faith systems; religious traditions entwine with and shape history. The settlement of the inter-mountain West often leaves Latter-day Saints out of the picture, focusing on Frederick Jackson Turner's secular Frontier Theory. The development and tribulations of early Mormonism, from upstate New York, to Governor Bogg's 1838 extermination order in Missouri, and the pioneer period, are fascinating. Unique in American history, Mormonism was singled out for persecution, yet survived the difficult exodus West.This book is an accessible introduction, though when Bigelow and Riess attempt to be topical, they become glib. When the humor works, it's fun, but bloopers abound: they describe writer and Mormon convert Anne Perry in Peter Jackson's filmHeavenly Creatures, stating the film \\"is based on a girlhood experience of Perry's\\" (Bigelow and Riess 2005:320). A girlhood experience? Riess and Bigelow make it sound like the gal just went on a picnic, or tried out for cheer-leading. Perry was convicted of brutally murdering her girlfriend's mother, which Jackson's film portrays. As well, there is a constant mocking of conservative Mormon culture, decrying that \\"Mormonism hasn't yet given rise to a Phillip Roth or a Woody Allen\\" (2005:317). Stereotypes, anyone? Mormons can be thankful not to have produced such dated, overblown, wretched misogynists and pretentious pseudo-literati as Roth or Allen.Though the historic Mormon experience has been extremely well researched and documented by many, Riess and Bigelow seriously err with their lite portrayal of Joseph Smith's life and death. Smith repeatedly relocated early Latter-day Saints in the face of overwhelming obstacles, from upstate New York to the creation of the bustling city Nauvoo. Try the vivid biography by eminent historian and National Book Award winner Robert Vincent Remini instead:Joseph Smith (Penguin Lives).A surprising error perpetuates prejudices, when the authors describe Joseph Smith's death from the point of view of the mob. Bigelow and Riess write that when Joseph Smith ran to the window to escape the assassins, who had already killed his brother and were shooting at him, Smith was: \\"reportedly lifting his arms in the MASONIC signal of distress\\" (Bigelow and Riess 2005:197). Caps mine. Why repeat balderdash created by the perpetrators? The man was fleeing shooters, not making superfluous Masonic gestures. You don't have to be a Mormon to figure that out. Many accurate accounts exist, none of them ascribe Masonic movements to Smith's death. The characterization of the historic Missouri Danites simply as a \\"gang,\\" when they formed to defend fellow Mormons against persecution, is controversial, whatever they may have morphed into. \\"For Mormons, history is theology, so they can't take it lightly\\" (2005:185). Thus, get it right. The slim history portion of the book, however flawed, should have been placed at the forefront, to provide context for the faith. However, Bigelow and Riess describe many unique aspects of Mormonism. Regarding the Mormon pioneer experience, they humorously describe food-storage and desire to never go hungry again, with substantial portions of tater casseroles.

If you are (as the title implies) a dummy, read this book. If you are an intelligent person capable of critical thinking, then Mormonism isn't for you and neither is this book."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"This book describes the main tenets of Mormonism: polytheism, polygamy, racism, baptism for the dead, Mormon rituals etc.It is easy to read, but deliberately dishonest in many points.Throughout the book the authors say that the Mormon god has one wife, while, standard Mormon theology teaches that he is a polygamist (Journal of Discourses vol 13 page 109, the Seer by LDS Apostle Orson Pratt). This is the reason why they believe there are so many spirit children that have been waiting for a body of flesh and bones.The Mormon \\"Jesus\\" is a polygamist too, and according to early Mormon leaders was crucified for this reason. (Journal of Discourses vol. 2 page 210, vol. 1 page 345).Polygamy, according to early Mormons, was compulsory to become a god (Journal of Discourses page 11 page 269), so God and Jesus must have practiced it.The authors also claim that the celestial hope for Mormons is to become like god while the most important Mormon revelation, Section 132 of Joseph Smith's Doctrine and Covenants, teaches that the Celestial Mormon hope is to become a god.Men and women in Mormonism are spiritually unequal and women cannot have the same \\"privileges\\" after death.The best hope for a man is to become a god, reign over his own kingdom and be worshipped by his children.The best hope for a woman, that according to Doctrine and Covenants 132:62 is nothing but a belonging, is to become one of his unnamed wives, eternally pregnant. Nobody will worship her and she cannot be the main god.For this reason, as the authors write in page 129, a widower who marry another wife has the power to spend his eternity with both wives, a widow can marry a second husband only for time. Being a property and a goddess by reflection, she cannot spend her eternity with both husbands.Being spiritually inferior, according to Mormonism, she is not capable to love more than one husband.In page 221 the authors describe the typical Mormon missionaries' alleged reaction when asked about polygamy. They imply that they look unconfortable.I spoke to many missionaries and when I asked about polygamy, they were not uncomfortable at all. They always are very professional and polite, and usually say that there were more women than men and polygamy was a temporary sacrifice for the restoration. (lying for the Lord is a strategy promoted by the LDS Church).When they are showed Doctrine and Covenants section 132, they admit that polygamy is a holy practice and the purpose of God for the human race.They know that the practice is only suspended and it will be reinstated with the Second Coming of Jesus.(Mormon Doctrine, by LDS Apostle McConkie, page 578).They are not bothered about that.The reaction that the authors described is typical among LDS women, though. They usually cannot accept that the monogamous families in their Church are the result of a political compromise (1890 Manifesto by Woodruff) and that Mormon men are still polygamist at heart.In page 223 there is an attempt to show early Mormon women strong and indipendent.The authors wrote: \\"Strong women who believed in the nobility of their cause didn't appreciate being described as oppressed or delusional. According to custom of the time, first wives sometimes initiated the discussions about bringing home a new wife into the family and tipically had to approve of the new marriage\\".LDS prophet Brigham Young had a different opinion on this matter:\\"But it is not the privilege of a woman to dictate the husband , and tell who or or how many he shall take, or what he shall do with them when he gets them, but it is the duty of a woman to submit cheerfully\\" Brigham Young Journal of Discourses vol. 17 page 159.Doctrine and Covenants 132:64 openly predicted the fate reserved to disobedient women:They would be destroyed. These women did not act out of strenght, but out of fear and submission.Furthermore, the approval of the first wife was not always compulsory.If she had refused without a good reason the Church would have performed the new marriage anyway. (\\"Mormon Polygamy: a History\\" by LDS scholar Wan Vagoner; his book reports early leaders' commands and early LDS literature).Young wives were usually forced by their devout Mormon parents; this was the case with the youngest of Joseph Smith's wives, Helen Mar Kimball, daughter of the apostle Heber and relative of one of the authors.She was 14 at the time of her marriage and at the beginning she abhorred polygamy. His father, husband of 40 wives, taught her that her eternal salvation dipended on her marriage to the \\"prophet\\"(had she refused, she would have been destroyed by the \\"Lord\\")So, she eventually became a strong promoter of polygamy.In page 224, in an attempt to show that polygamy was not about sex and that men did not live in harems, the authors tell us that most polygamous men had only a couple of wives or so, and each wife had her own house.According to D&C; 132, the practice of concubinage is portrayed in a positive way: and a concubine is a servant and a sexual object (the fact that a plural wife had a home of her own, and in many \\"families\\" there was \\"only\\" a couple of wives rather than 30 or 40, did not change her status).Heber Kimball, ancestor of one of the authors, openly described his wives as numbers and objects to increase his own kingdom.His words are in Journal of Discourses vol 5 page 22:\\"I would not be afraid to promise a man who is sixty years of age, if he will take the counsel of brother Brigham and his brethren, that he will renew his age. I have noticed that a man who has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality looks fresh, young and sprightly.Why is this? Because God loves that man, and because he honours His work and word. Some of you may not believe this; but I not only believe it - I also know it. For a man of God to be confined to one woman is small besiness; for it is as much as we can do now to keep up under the burdens we have to carry; and I do not know what we should do if we had only one wife apiece.\\"And also, in Jornal of Discourses vol 4. page 209:\\"Supposing that I have a wife or a dozen of them, and she should say, 'You cannot be exalted without me', and suppose they all should say so, what of that?... Suppose that i lose the whole of them before I go into the spirit world, but that i have been good, faithful man... do you think i will be destitute there. No, the Lord says there are more there than thereare here... there are millions of them... we will go to brother Joseph (Smith) and say, ' Here we are brother Joseph; we are here ourselves are we not, with none of the property we possessed in our probationary state, not even the rings of our fingers' He will say to us, 'Come along, my boys, we will give you a good suit of clothes.

In more recent years, Mormon Church officials once again agreed to refrain from performing proxy baptisms for Holocaust victims by those not related to the victims and to remove the names of victims, from its \\"ordinance database,\\" when evidence is produced that an unauthorized baptism had been performed.A word of explanation about \\"proxy baptism.\\" Mormons perform, what they call \\"crucial gospel ordinances,\\" such as baptism, on behalf of dead people. According to Mormon theology, this practice gives the dead person's spirit the opportunity to accept the Christian Gospel (The New Testament) in order to enter the middle or highest level of their multi-tiered heaven, called the \\"Terrestrial kingdom and Celestial kingdom,\\" respectively. The lowest level of their heaven is called the \\"Telestial kingdom.\\" According to the book, this kingdom is reserved for repentant adulterers, liars, murderers, rapists, and those who \\"received not the gospel of Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus, not even in the spirit world.\\"Therefore, \\"Mormon theology teaches that good people of many different religious traditions will live in paradise forever; they may even dwell in the highest of the three kingdoms, if they accept the gospel in the spirit world and so qualify.\\" Since Mormons want everyone to make it into the highest levels of heaven, they perform proxy baptisms (and the other ordinances or sacraments) on behalf of the souls of the dead, which provides the deceased person's soul a choice: either accept the Christian Gospel and enter the upper levels of heaven or reject the Christian Gospel and stay in the Telestial kingdom, with the fine next door neighbors mentioned above, or even worse yet, be sent to Outer darkness (hell) with Satan and his followers.In other words, if you don't accept Christianity, either as a mortal or as a spirit, you get to spend eternity with the likes of repentant \\"adulterers, liars, murderers and rapists\\" and others who likewise didn't accept the Christian Gospel. How's that for a pleasant concept?Therefore, there is no entry into the highest levels of heaven if you are Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim, Baha'i, Atheist, Agnostic etc., unless you reject your own faith or beliefs in death and accept Christianity. There is one exception: if you have never heard of the Christian Gospel before your death and accept it as a spirit, you're in. If you reject it, you're out. Is there someone on this planet, within the last 1,500 years, who hasn't heard of Christianity or The New Testament?Why do Jews object to the proxy baptism of Holocaust victims? The Second World War was the most destructive conflict in human history. During the war, six million Jews (all civilian, non-combatants) were rounded up by the Nazis: their property was confiscated; they were herded into ghettos under deplorable conditions; they were starved and beaten; and, then shipped off to slave labor camps to be worked to death or to extermination centers to be gassed to death--men, women and children. No exceptions! The Nazis named their genocidal program: \\"The Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.\\" What was the problem? The problem was that Jews existed. According to Nazi ideology, Jews didn't deserve to live; so, the Nazis systematically murdered them because they were Jewish. Of course, not all victims of the Holocaust were Jewish; but all Jews were victims.Mormons want to convert the souls of these dead Jews, murdered in the Holocaust, to Christianity, so they can enter heaven. These victims were stripped of their human dignity in life and are now being stripped of their human dignity in death. In other words, being Jewish wasn't good enough to live on earth; and, now it is not good enough to enter heaven. To say that the tortured and murdered victims of the Holocaust must first reject their own religion for which they murdered and then convert to another religion before being allowed admittance into heaven is nothing short of appalling.Here is the twisted irony in all of this: if the spirit of a Holocaust victim refuses to renounce his or her Judaism, by accepting the Christian Gospel, his or her soul (if they qualify) will be relegated to the Telestial kingdom, very possibly alongside the repentant Nazis that murdered them. In fact, Mormons have posthumously baptized not only Anne Frank, but Adolf Hitler as well. There is something quite perverted about this outcome.One would think that nothing could rehabilitate these Nazi mass murderers and their despicable leaders, and that Outer darkness would be their place in Mormon cosmology, without exception.For example, Adolf Eichman was the SS Officer assigned to run Hitler's concentration camps. It was his job to make sure that enough Zyklon B was available to carryout mass gassings and that the trains had enough fuel to carry their victims to their deaths. It was reported that, while awaiting execution for his crimes, he accepted Jesus Christ as his lord and savior. Is he now in the Telestial kingdom with the Jewish people he murdered?Of course, the proxy baptisms continue for non-Holocaust Jews and people of all other faiths, all of which is objectionable. The authors and other Mormons might argue that other mainstream Christian groups (Catholics and Protestants) also believe that heaven is denied to those who haven't accepted the Gospel and it is only the Mormons who give these souls a chance through their proxy baptisms. If so, this Christian belief of heaven for Christians only is the epitome of chauvinism and ethnocentrism. No religion has a monopoly on eternal truth.I can not image God or Jesus (or whatever name you call the Supreme deity) limiting entry to heaven to Christians, only. Rather, human souls are judged on the content of their characters and the goodness of their hearts; not the particular religion they were born into. We were all created in God's image--all of us, not just some of us!And, yet the authors are puzzled by the hullabaloo!"},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"First- this book is written by Mormons. Second- they will never tell you the complete truth.Joseph Smith slept with and married 14 year old girls. FACT- Helen Kimball was 14 years old when Joe Smith talked to her father Brother Kimball and said that if he would give Helen to him to be his wife Joe would promise brother Kimball that he and his family would stand next to Joe, who would be standing next to Christ in the eternities. Pedophile or prophet?I was taught that Joe married old widows that didn't have any food or money and Joe so generously entered into a polygamous marriage with them. Fact- one third of his wives were 19 years old and younger. Another third were in their twenties and most of the rest were friends wives that were in their thirties. One friend William Law turned him down and was going to publish the truth about Joe Smith so Joe had his newspaper business and building destroyed by his goons the Nauvoo Legion. Joe sent out the order and within one hour and a half of Joe giving the order the buiding and all the papers inside were burned and destroyed. Mob boss or man of God?Brigham Young preached Blood Atonement and said he would stab his own wife in the heart as she lay sleeping next to him if he deemed that she had committed a sin that would keep her out of heaven and therefore he was willing to murder her in cold blood so that her blood would be spilled and would atone for her sins and she would be able to enter heaven.This story is documented in the Mormon Journal of Discourses that is a journal of all the conference talks by the prophets during the beginning of the church. The church no longer publishes these journals but, does still publish the conference talks of the prophets today. Joe Smith and Brigham Young are so revered in the church why would their conference talks be deleted and erased like they never existed. Few mormons even know about the Journal of Discourses. Please Research -Meadow Mountain Massacre, which happened during Brigham's reign and how innocent families were murdered in cold blood by Mormons dressed up as Indians. Murdering Madman or prophet?The real story of the death of Joe Smith. The citizens of Nauvoo demanded Joe stand trial for his order to destroy the printing press, papers and building of William Law. So Joe had a Church court, which consisted of the men that destroyed the building, and therefore they declared Joe not guilty of any crime. The citizens were outraged and they called for the help of the government. The government came and decided that they needed to move Joe Smith to a City were he didn't have absolute control of the Mormon people and he would receive a fair trial. Joe was moved to Carthage. On his way to Carthage Joe said \\"he was like a lamb being lead to the slaughter knowing he had done no wrong\\". BS!No one in the church knows the reason Joe was taken and jailed in Carthage. Members believe Satan was trying to destroy the only true church on the face of this earth and Joe was in grave danger by the forces of evil and he was being taken away by evil men, not by the government. While Joe was in Carthage jail angry men stormed the jail. Joe had a gun and fired several shots yet the men shot Joe and he fell out the window and died. I was fed such lies about the truth.The church is full of lies! The Book of Mormon is about a Jewish family that is led to the Americas to populate the continent. Joe didn't know about DNA testing. guess what? There is not one ounce of Jewish blood in any native American Indian! The Book of Mormon is a piece of FICTION!! Yet, Mormons believe it to be the work of God and the cornerstone of their religion. Joe was a magnificent liar and charismatic genus. Yet he was not a prophet!There are so many lies and so much fear based teaching and brain washing that keep the members afraid to even discuss the truth. They believe Satan's mignons are trying to lead them astray if they listen to anything that is not sanctioned by the church. They are scared to death to discuss or even listen to the truth.Mormons look all nice and shiny on the outside but what really happens to them is they lose their ability to think for themselves and become co-dependent on the church for their self worth and salvation.There are so many horror stories I could tell you but few people really want to know the truth.

That book was a complete dud! It was written in a very naive apologetic tone that entirely avoids any topic that might not sound flattering to the faith, and promptly sanitizes the few unavoidable uncomfortable issues (e.g. polygamy).This book is precisely the opposite. In a very respectful and Mormon-friendly tone, it tackles just about every thorny subject regarding the faith, providing brief incursions in all sides (and arguments) of each controversial point.Some of the topics it approaches include questions regarding Book of Mormon historicity and translation, evolution, anti-ERA and anti-SSM campaigns (and tithing money dedicated thereto), same-sex attraction (with internet links to gay-Mormon support groups), Adam-God, 1844 succession crisis, Mormon role (Church and State issues) on 19th century persecution, birth control (recent changes in policy), polygamy (dispelling myths about the practice from both sides, including current practitioners), race issues (including Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis; and current persisting racist beliefs), gender issues (God the Mother, the role of Eve, and women & Priesthood), Mountain Meadows Massacre (even acknowledging some researchers question whether BY ordered it), Mormon approaches to the problem of evil (as related to pre-mortal life and popular beliefs therefrom), historical changes in tithing emphasis (compared to financial conundrums), Word of Wisdom issues (both historical contexts and influences, as well as specific controversies like vanilla extract, cola drinks, and vegetarianism), and even the idiosyncratic practice of praying in the Thee/Thou mode!Long list? Hence the strength of the book. Naturally, as is typical of the series, the discussions are quick and curt -- as it behooves an introductory tome.

It covered LDS theology and history in more depth, more breath, and more candor than I've ever seen in a summary book on Mormonism.

They document some of the warts and bruises of LDS history while balancing them with what I felt was very fair treatment.

I think my ward would be changed for the better if they all read it.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Review======Title: Mormonism for DummiesAuthor: Jana Reiss and Christopher BigelowPublisher: Wiley Publishing, Inc.Genre: Non-fictionYear Published: 2005Number of Pages: 365Binding: PaperbackISBN: 0-7645-7195-8Price: $21.99Reviewed by Jeffrey NeedleI had grand plans for this review. They were, alas, dashed, as a friend pointed me to a review published in the Deseret News, wherein the writer covered pretty much everything I wanted to say. Sigh. He who hesitates...If you are familiar with the \\"Dummies\\" series published by Wiley, you'll know that there are a wide variety of topics covered, from science to math to home improvement to just about anything you can think of. My own previous experience with a Dummies book was with my purchase of \\"Calculus for Dummies.\\" It turned out to be exactly that - calculus for those who don't mind the frequent, and annoying, side trips of a writer who lacks imagination and feels that cute (yuck) little jokes are absolutely necessary in order for a person to learn mathematics.I had higher hopes for the current volume. I know both authors from their contributions on the Association for Mormon Letters discussion list. I was not disappointed. \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" was one of the best reads I've had in a long time.Part I is titled \\"What the Mormon Faith is All About.\\" It includes an easily grasped overview of Mormonism's worldview, with an explanation of the \\"plan of salvation\\" from the LDS point of view. Here the reader learns of the pre-existence, the war in heaven, Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother, etc. Quite a bit to chomp on if you're new to these concepts! Ideas like eternal marriage and the restoration of the priesthood are also covered.Part II, \\"Eternal Rituals and Endless Meetings,\\" covers some of the details of the weekly meeting block, a bit about the Temple and the rituals performed therein, and a glimpse at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City.Part III, \\"Holy Books and Sacred History,\\" explains the nature of continuing revelation, the various books of scripture in the LDS Church, and a brief overview of Church history.Part IV, \\"Mormonism Today,\\" talks about what it means to be a Mormon in today's world. It includes discussions about stewardship, missionary work, and other aspects of Mormon life.Part V, \\"The Part of Tens,\\" is a regular part of each \\"Dummies\\" book, offering ten highlights in different areas - for example, ten Mormon historic places to visit, etc.Now, there are at least two ways to make such a book readable and lively. One way is to plug it with senseless, and often unfunny, comments designed to talk down to the reader. Or, you can approach all this with a sense of balance and a desire to truly educate, using humor and class to enhance the reading experience. Happily, the authors chose the latter.In fact, a few days before writing this review, I had some visitors in my home. They're here from time to time, always interested in going through my books. The spotted \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" - frankly, I'd spoken about the book over dinner - and were skeptical. When one of them picked up the book and started reading, she just couldn't put it down.What keeps you turning the pages is the amazing honesty and fair-mindedness of the book. And all this speaks to how Mormon history and life are depicted in books intended for a general audience. Those looking for the consistently positive will have no problem finding books and pamphlets to meet their needs. Similarly, anyone wanting the bad can find enough at the local Christian bookstore, or on the Internet, to satisfy interest. \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" tells the story from the perspective of faithful members of the Church who believe that Mormonism is far more nuanced, more layered, than either extreme will have you believe.Let's sample a few of the discussions:Was Jesus Married?Mormons view marriage as an eternal covenant that all men and women must make in order to be *exalted*, or become like God...In addition, Mormons believe that Jesus Christ set a perfect example in all things. According to this logic, the Savior must've gotten married at some point.Some early Mormon leaders speculated that the marriage at Cana, where Jesus turned water into wine, was actually his own wedding, which would explain why he was trying to be a good host. Additionally, some Mormons believe that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and had children, and they reject the notion that Magdalene was a reformed whore. However, modern Church leaders pretty much avoid this subject altogether. (p. 47)Does this accurately reflect Mormon views throughout the years? I think it does.And this discussion on BYU was amazingly frank:BYU's mission is to combine the highest-quality secular teaching with religious education to produce eternally well-rounded graduates. Although most of the secular classes are like those at any other university, occasionally professors bring prayer or spiritual perspective into the classroom...To maintain control over the university, in recent years the Church has increased its oversight of BYU and clamped down on perceived troublemakers. The Church now appoints the university president from among its own General Authorities. LDS professors must hold a current *temple recommend*... and the handful of non-Mormon faculty must abide by similarly high moral standards. From time to time, BYU denies tenure to faculty members not because of inadequate scholarship but because their expressions aren't in harmony with official Church teachings or standards, particularly in the areas of history, anthropology, and literature. As a result, professional agencies have criticized BYU for its lack of academic freedom. (p. 147-8)Once again, a very fair appraisal of the situation at BYU, in my opinion. And, I think, an excellent example of writing in such a way that each reader may read the text through his or her own lens of experience. The previous paragraph will certainly be read differently by faithful members and by critics.As I thought through what I would write here, I had a radical idea - every prospective missionary ought to read this book before going on his or her mission. It covers just about everything they may encounter while on their missions - the Mountain Meadows Massacre, polygamy, blacks and the priesthood, etc. And it gives a fair view of these issues, leaving nothing to surprise them.I was a bit dismayed when the reviewer in the Deseret News suggested the same thing - missionaries ought to read this. And I thought it was my idea!! I'll somehow recover from the blow.Although seasoned Mormon historians and theologians are not likely to learn much from \\"Mormonism for Dummies,\\" it nonetheless offers easy to understand, thoroughly balanced, and often amusing explanations for some of the more arcane corners of the religion. Consider the following in the discussion on polygamy, trying to dismiss false notions about the practice:\\"Polygamy was all about sex.\\" Not really. In fact, some of the plural marriages contracted in Utah were for *eternity only*, meaning that the wife would be on the man's rolls in heaven, but they would have no earthly rolls in the hay. (p. 224)I dare you to read that and not smile.Here's the bottom line, in my opinion: there may have been a time when the general public were not aware of some of Mormonism's beliefs and challenges. For many, all they knew were the Tabernacle Choir and the nicely-dressed missionaries. Today, with the Internet and other media, enemies of the Church have found it easier to attack the Church on many fronts. Missionaries going door to door need to be better prepared to answer the inevitable questions.I've been entertaining missionaries in my home for years. From time to time they ask questions that are, to be honest, quite startling. They've been told things by some of their contacts, and they are things they've never heard before. I believe it's time to better arm the young men and women who go out and introduce the Church to the world. \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" would be a great beginning.I loved this book, and highly recommend it.-----------------------------------Jeff NeedleAssociation for Mormon Lettersjeff.needle@general-net.comjeff.needle@hotpop.com"},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I just finished reading this book cover to cover. Although, as with in other Dummies books, it would be reasonable to use this book as a reference book. I have learned a considerable amount about this religion. This five part book is composed of twenty-one chapters.Part 1: \\"What the Mormon Faith is All About\\"This covers Mormon beliefs and doctrinePart 2: \\"Eternal Rituals and endless Meetings\\"This covers the organizational structure (like church hierarchy) and functions and ritual practices.Part 3: \\"Holy books and Sacred History\\"This covers the religious texts that the church bases its religion on. It also explores the origins and history of Mormonism.Part 4: \\"Mormonism Today\\"This covers current doctrine, practices, missionaries, and controversial issues.Part 5: \\"The Part of Ten\\"This includes \\"Ten famous Mormons,\\" \\"Quick Answers to Ten Common Questions about Mormonism\\", and \\"Ten Mormon Places to Visit\\".If you want to know more about the individual chapters, I recommended using Amazon's \\"Search Inside\\" feature to look at the first few pages.Jana Riess and Christopher Bigelow are qualified to write to the book. In the book, they both state publicly that they are active members of the Mormon Church. I believe this makes for an informed read. They include many historical facts that I doubt the majority of Mormons know. However, I wish they would have had at least a one non-Mormon contributor. Often times, the book feels like it was officially written by the Mormon Church. They do confront controversies and issues within the Mormon religion, but they are frequently downplayed in the end. It may not be the most appropriate treatment for book under the \\"Dummies\\" series.Overall, however, I am satisfied with this book. At 348 pages, it covers the majority of topics I wanted to know about the Mormon religion. I am much more educated about this new religion today. With the dash of humor and approachably that the Dummies books offer, I will keep this one on my shelf."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"(Full disclosure: I'm acquainted with Christopher Bigelow and have had friendly correspondence by e-mail with Jana Riess, the authors of this book.) The series title \\"...for Dummies\\" really bugs me, especially in this case, because this is not a book for stupid people. It's for intelligent people who don't have all the information they want. The authors of \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" never talk down or condescend to you. Rather, they offer you a full smorgasboard of things you need to know about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons). Like many faith traditions, Mormonism is something you can spend a whole lifetime investigating and never get to the bottom. But Bigelow and Riess, both faithful members, have put together what you could call a mini-encyclopedia that answers most of the questions you could come up with. They cover doctrine, history, and particularly culture, so that by the end of the book you get a vivid sense of just what it must be like to be a Mormon. If you think Mormons are somehow wacky or weird, this book will give you a glimpse of the power and breadth of Mormon thought, and may make you rethink your prejudices. The tone of this book is admirably moderate in its tackling of the many gray areas of Mormon practice, like whether it's OK for Mormons to see R-rated movies, or whether caffeinated sodas are against the health code called the \\"Word of Wisdom\\". If you aren't Mormon, this book is an excellent source of information; if you are Mormon this book is still illuminating in that you may find out that some things you thought weren't true really are, or vice versa. This gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I am a Buddhist and my brother is an elder in the LDS Church. Mom was a Unitarian (let this be a warning to all Unitarian moms out there!) Anyway, I didn' t know a lot about Mormon beliefs, so I picked up this book and found it to be very, very informative. When my brother came to visit me, he was amazed at the informed questions I was able to ask, and his eyes really popped when I told him my source was a book called \\"Mormonism for Dummies!\\" It even explains about the special underwear!Speaking of underwear, this book doesn't get into any of the church's dirty laundry, but that's OK - the authors aren't pretending to be objective scholars, here. So, if you're like me and just want to understand what the church teaches, then this is the book for you. Now when those handsome young missionaries from BYU show up at your door, you'll be able to astonish them with more than your home-baked cookies!"},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Although I consider myself a knowledgeable Latter-day Saint, I simply loved this book! The authors, both active Mormons, provide a detailed yet simple overview of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, such as a discussion of the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith, what occurs in Latter-day Saint chapels on Sundays, the afterlife according to Mormonism, and so forth.If anyone is looking to know what \\"Mormons\\" believe, this would be a book near the top of my list of recommendations."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"We recently were relocated through my husbands employer to Salt Lake City. And I'd known a few mormons. However, I was warned it was \\"different\\" down there in Utah. SO I got this book to help me understand a bit. Glad I did. For basic information, this book seems to be very informative. It doesn't have everything (how can it?) The glossary of terms was great. Whenever we'd hear something, we'd immediately look it up. They have a section in there about how a typical Sunday service is held - information which was of no use to us. There is a lot of the history of the religon.If you're moving to SLC, this is an indispensible tool."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I kept hearing on TV that surveys show a lot of people were saying they would not vote for a Mormon for President. Since the Constitution says \\"no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States,\\" I wondered what in Mormonism could be so extreme that it would cause a large number of people to abandon one of the basic moral principles of our nation and create a religious test for public office.I read the book from cover to cover. Apparently the religion is less sadistic than many of the world's mainstream religions. I could find nothing that precludes a president being a member of that church, although churchly duties take a lot of time and might interfere. There are extremists in any religion, but my impression from the book is that Mormonism has fewer than most. In choosing a president, Americans have prefered one that puts his country over his religion.(In the interest of disclosure, I disagree with most of the political views of many Mormons, but the religion doesn't seem to preclude public office and seems, on the whole, to be better than most.)The book bogs down a bit when it gets to church organization, but that might be because I was more interested in the philosophy than in the structure. I gave it only 4 stars because I got bored near the end."},{"Title":"Mormonism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"My ancestors on my maternal grandmother's side joined the LDS church in the 1800's in Ohio, they followed the church to Nauvoo in Illinois on to Missouri and finally to Salt Lake City, Utah. Family lore has it that my great....etc grandparents lived on the same street as Brigham Young. When he pushed them to join into a plural marriage situation, they rebelled. My grandfather left to join a wagon train to California. In the middle of the night, my grandmother with her 5 month son and her 7 year old daughter, left to join him. My grandmother had never driven a wagon.I have always been curious about the tenets of the LDS church and what would drive anyone to accept plural marriage as a norm. I wanted a quick way to answer my questions and this book has served that purpose. I think I now understand what motivated the church to promoted this condition. This book has also probed me into trying to trace my ancestry."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"I found War Story by Jim Morris to be a compelling tale of a time in American history that was largely misunderstood by most US citizens. Discriptions of the country side, the people, the culture of Vietnam wove beauty into the story of war. Jim's sense of humor also added to the tale and gave me a chuckle when I least expected it. Jim's writing gives meaning to the old Civil War adage \\"Soldier's Heart to Warrior Spirit\\" which still rings true today. Well Done!!!"},{"Title":"War Story","review":"I realize that for the last ten or fifteen years, there has been a flood of Vietnam War-related memoirs. However, Jim Morris' WAR STORY is an historical account you do not want to miss. In the early years of Vietnam, the author was an Army Special Forces Captain and advisor to both the South Vietnamese army an the indigenous Montagnards. WAR STORY chronicles Morris' adventures--some rather precarious--with these two groups. The battle scenes are vivid, and perfectly capture the chaos of a running gun fight in a jungle. What is best about WAR STORY, however, is Morris' ability to study himself, his comrades, and the war, without flinching. Part of this is due to the author's training as a journalist; also because the book was written in 1979, while the war was still fresh. All in all, this book will show you what it was like to be a soldier in the early days of the Vietnam War, when victory was still attainable."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"Story was more about what an officer in the us army was not suppose to do and things he did was was not very professional"},{"Title":"War Story","review":"Jim Morris was in-country from early on, before the first conventional troops were deployed, until after the Tet Offensive. As an officer in Special Forces, he bounced around quite a bit in South Vietnam, able to put both the forest and the trees of that conflict into a perspective that your average lowly grunt (or a REMF in Saigon, for that matter) could not--at least without years of investigative journalism afterwards, I'd bet.War Story is about a man whose chief aspiration in life was to be a soldier. While other young men were dragged to Vietnam kicking and screaming, or dodged the draft altogether, Jim Morris and other members of the Special Forces volunteered for Vietnam. Against his wishes, Morris was assigned jobs either in the rear or on Okinawa--jobs other men would have killed for. Still, he clawed and scratched his way back to the periphery of the conflict. Sometimes right into the hot thick of it--you can be certain that, unlike some who've attempted to parlay their service into political success, Morris earned his Purple Hearts. In fact, Morris actually feared promotion beyond 0-3 (Captain), because it would nix his chances to command an A-Team.Had there been more officers like this in my time, I might have held to my original plan of being a 30-Year-Man. Or at least 20. Morris was a soldier who cared about the mission, and wanted to make a difference, armed with ideas which could have done so. He worked within the system, but (and this is one thing I love about SF) wasn't obsessed with following counterproductive protocols, or eating cheese. He wanted to fight, and to win, while the average career officer just wants to brown-nose, shuffle paperwork, and admire rows of spit-shined boots and starched uniforms all perfectly dress-right-dressed.But not only was victory not an objective for the US chain-of-command, the South Vietnamese weren't much interested in it, either. The ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) was infamous for its corruption and incompetence. It would be hard to name a military organization more rife with cowards, crooks, traitors and fools. Whatever good soldiers fought for the South were buried under bureaucratic BS.Morris relates the story of how some loyal villagers reported six VC (Viet Cong) sighted in a certain ARVN officer's district. \\"Only one weapon between them.\\" That ARVN commander could have captured them quickly and easily, possibly getting some valuable intelligence into the bargain. Instead, he sent the report up his ponderous chain of command. Three days after the VC left the village, an airstrike leveled it. That's how loyalty was rewarded. Any wonder why most of the Vietnamese citizens turned a blind eye to VC activity?As Morris hops around South Vietnam in War Story, you might want to follow along on a map. Having never been there myself, I was unfamiliar with the geography and sometimes grew confused about where he was and when he had been there before. The command structure on both the American and South Vietnamese sides were equally cumbersome. Heck, it was a convoluted mess by WWII and has only gotten worse every decade since then.Other Amazon reviewers complain about the structure of the narrative--that there are too many flashbacks, sidetracks and personal reflections, and they make it difficult to keep a grip on the main thrust of the memoir. I say the style perfectly fits an account of the Vietnam War. If you have trouble tracking the story in this book, you'll probably have much more difficulty ever fully understanding that conflict. To me, it was worth keeping a map handy and taking notes on the people who weaved in and out of the story.Morris himself says: \\"There is only one way to fight a guerilla war and that is to outguerilla the guerilla. You have to steal his political issues and his social issues and his tactics; and if you do that he has nothing left to sell and the war is won. It was so easy. Why couldn't the bastards see it? Maybe that was what made me not one of the boys: the fact that I moved around so much as a kid that I was highly sensitive to new social situations. That was what made me not one of the boys. Maybe I knew what I was doing and 'The Boys' didn't.\\"And Morris could certainly adapt to new social situations. He didn't just work with the 'Yards (Montagnards--ostracized mountain tribes of Vietnam), but made friends with them. He could make sense of their military and social network, and knew who could get the job done unclouded by the \\"all Dinks are the same\\" attitude held by some of the more condescending officers on our side of the fence. One such 'Yard comrade, nicknamed \\"Cowboy,\\" is a fascinating enough character to warrant his own biography.I could go on at great length about this book and what I learned from it. I recommend that you just read it and let Morris' narrative speak for itself.For a more detailed review, you can read my post about this book on the Two-Fisted Blog.Henry Brown, author ofHell and Gone"},{"Title":"War Story","review":"War Story was one of the first personal narratives to come out of the Vietnam War, and the first one I read. I have read many Vietnam \\"War Stories\\" since then, and this withstands the test of time. Morris has a gift for story telling. When he is describing places and events I am there with him... and unseen, unmentioned member of his team. It is easy to feel despair when the team faces hardship (more often at the hands of American bureaucracy than the Communists.) It is easy to feel good when they achieve. This book tells the story of the early advisory effort in Vietnam, there is not a lot of combat and \\"shoot-em-up.\\" It also follows the escalation, to which Morris was more of an observer than a participant. You are not going to get the image that everyone has of the conflict from this book. You will hear the story of well trained and dedicated volunteers doing a necessary job under very difficult circumstances.My only complaint would be the lack of maps and details of time line. In many ways the book is disjointed. This helps the narrative, but makes it hard for anyone who is really trying to learn about the war. This might not be as important to some, but I am a serious student of this period in the conflict. I find the book much more understandable years later having a lot more grounding in the background."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"WAR STORY by Jim Morris is one of those books you have to have in your collection of war stories.

(You can read about them in &quot;Incident at Muc Wa&quot;.) Jim Morris was in the team that replaced these guys a few months later, and he inherited their interpreter, a handsome Montagnard called Cowboy, who unbeknownst to the Americans was a leading figure in an independence movement called Fulro, for Liberation of Oppressed Races.Morris tells his own story--the American story--of his multiple tours as a Green Beret in Vietnam. But running through it is the parallel story of Cowboy, who becomes a warlord in his own right--a sort of &quot;fourth force&quot; in this many-pronged war whose major participants were the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese, and the Americans. Cowboy worked for the Americans, plotted for the Montagnard, and may well have been murdered by the South Vietnamese.I just discovered this book last year, when it was recommended to me by one of the Green Berets I'd known in 1964. I'm delighted to see that it's back in print. It belongs on the shelf of any student of the Vietnam war."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"I read Jim Morris' classic Special Forces memoir while I was in Iraq. I was a young Special Forces Sergeant myself and as it turns out I was dealing with a lot of the same successes and frustrations that Jim was confronted with during his war in Vietnam. I say that this book is timeless and I really mean that. War Story is a great book about the specifics, the tactics and atmosphere felt when going out on patrol, a great boots-on-the-ground first person account of war but it is more than just that. To date I feel that this is the best book written about US Army Special Forces. You can take the word \\"communist\\" and replace it with the word \\"terrorist\\" and War Story could almost be a book about my experiences in Iraq.War Story should be required reading for every Special Forces soldier and is a must read for civilians looking to gain insight into a world that is often clouded with misconceptions. Jim is a powerful writer who had a powerful experience in Vietnam, a dangerous combination to be sure. I'm still waiting for someone like him to \\"tell it like it is\\" about the War on Terror but until then, War Story would be my first pick and will always be first on my list of books about Special Forces in the Vietnam War.-Jack Murphy, author of Reflexive Fire"},{"Title":"War Story","review":"Morris' book is first-rate. Although somewhat dated in the sense of who SF are today, this piece offers unique first-person accounts of what Vietnam was like. I felt the best parts of the book were his philosophical ruminations of policy, the truisms of counter-revolutionary war, etc. Specifically, he hit a bullseye with why we lost. I derive many similarities from his book to the situation brewing in Colombia (without the Cold War spin). Its a great primer for Vietnam readers and all those interested in SF. Only two areas that I felt were lacking: not enough background material to make the reader connect with the situation or &quot;time-space&quot; in the book, and his style was somewhat erratic. I don't remeber coming accross any dates for a couple hundred pages. From a military historian perspective, it lacked clarity and seemed to drift into &quot;free-thought&quot; of his experiences. However, I thought he provided excellent narratives of his bravery and heroism."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"From a literary standpoint, War Story is very disjointed and rambling. Side bars are frequent and often pointless. The book starts out with the author arriving in Nam for his second tour, then goes into a flashback of the first tour that lasts a third of the book, without telling what's going on. There are very few dates and no maps. There is not near as much action as most of the popular Viet Nam books, and the story is largely one of the author's frustration at not being allowed to command a combat team for more than a couple operations. The book may be of value for its unique content about Montagnard advisors before regular troops arrived, and the author certainly speaks from the heart."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"Author seemed sincere, not full of himself by any means.

This book should be read by any Q course or assesment wanna be. One of his greatist ideas is utilizing graphics of infiltration routes via contact locations to create good graphics of where to place ATeam camps. I thought this was brilliant. I am hoping the Army has solved this through the implementation of all the graphics they do in their preparation of the order of battle that is done in their planning cycles."},{"Title":"War Story","review":"I found the book to be a boring read.

After the Six Day war the Arabs wanted Israel to give back land they had taken and justice for the Palestinians. The Israelis wanted peace and the Arabs to recognize Israel's right to exist. But the Israelis had no intention of giving up land, and the Arabs were not likely to recognize Israel's legitimacyTension existed in the Middle East until war broke out again in October 1973. Kissinger had ignored the Middle East until then, after which he negotiated continually in the Middle East under Nixon and Ford to bring peace to keep the Soviets from exploiting the chaos.Carter started negotiations in the 70s, after Begin began construction of settlements on the lands captured in the Six Day war, indicating that the lands would be permanently held by Israel, making peace with the Arabs much more difficult. Carter worked hard to gain peace between Israel and Egypt which cost him in domestic politics. Carter mentioned the Palestinians for the first time in the negotiationsUnder Reagan there were a lot of plans, but little was accomplished. After the Gulf War Bush restarted peace negotiations, hoping that the Palestinians support of Saddam Hussein would weaken them, and the collapse of the Soviet Union would remove support for the Arabs. Quandt ends with an account of Clinton's attempts at peace in the Mideast.Quandt concludes that certain conditions must be met to gain success. There must be a realist appraisal of the regional situation, presidents like Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan considered Mideast policy as part of US Soviet relations. The President and his top advisors must work together in the negotiations, not like in the Rogers plan. There must be domestic support for American policy, a problem for Carter. Success as a mediator depends on a feeling for both process and substance. There must be quiet negotiation and preparation for negotiations. Pressure only succeeds if carefully exerted. Timing is crucial for successful negotiations.Because this book is about the peace process between America and Israel,there is almost no information about the domestic politics of any countries, especially the Arab countries. This book includes a good bibliography, and some good maps."},{"Title":"Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Isrli Conflict since 1967, Revised Edition","review":"This book provides an excellent analysis of the American involvement in the Arab Israeli conflict. It categorizes the conflict's resolution as a process evolving towards peace. The book picks up in 1967 with American involvement in trying to resolve the six day war and the aftermath where the Arab countries began thinking about a resolution to the conflict. The 1973 war marked another turning point in the conflict and the US response began to crystallize and become consistent with a possible solution. It became clear that the Soviet Union's quiet acquiesce would be necessary. The American negotiations are very clearly laid out in this book and the author does an excellent job of establishing motive. This is a wonderful book if you have a good knowledge of the conflict. For those seeking that history I would recommend Benny Morris book Righteous Victims.This book really shines in the Nixon and on era where the author clearly categorizes the diplomatic efforts of the Kissinger Shuttle, Camp David Accords, the Oslo agreements and the Road Map. Overall the author is fairly unbiased and places blame where appropriate. The one place where this is lacking is in the analysis of George W. Bush. While Bush has done little towards solving the crisis the second to last chapter is more about the war in Iraq and why it was a bad plan than why it detracted from the ability to focus on the Arab Israeli conflict. Despite this it is still the best book we have on American diplomatic history in this conflict and well worth the time to read if you want to understand the conflict."},{"Title":"Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Isrli Conflict since 1967, Revised Edition","review":"Quandt's Peace Process is a terrific encyclopedia of American Diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict.I found it engaging, thoughtful and fair.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in American diplomacy toward the Middle East."},{"Title":"Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Isrli Conflict since 1967, Revised Edition","review":"It worked for what I needed.

The author devotes an extradinary amount of detail to minor events and actions without really explaining the motives of the players behind the actions. The strongest part of the book is the Presidential Crisis decision making model, in which he explains how he feels US policy on the issue is molded. There is little to judge against, however, since the author does not really do justice to the other theories of US decisionmaking on the middle east. Whether or not he agrees with them, he could at least tell us why he thinks they are incorrect. And finally, the amount of minutia the author goes into ends up leaving the reader wishing he would just decide to highlight a few important events and motives."},{"Title":"Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Isrli Conflict since 1967, Revised Edition","review":"The Peace Process in Israel and Palestine is not going to come anytime soon. Israel has not given up its land and the Palestian people refuse to stop fighting for their homelands. It is a terrible state of affairs because the Israelis are getting so much military funding from the big Western governments such as the US and the Palestinians have not only the seen the destruction of their homeland but they have also witnessed the incredible destruction of their people. This book is a summary of all the major agreements since the 1946 UN declaration of the state of Israel up until the Camp David peace talks in 1996 during President Clinton's campaign. It is pretty good at describing the basic ideas of the peace accords but gives no new information on the diplomacy."},{"Title":"Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Isrli Conflict since 1967, Revised Edition","review":"I feel that this book deals beautifully with the issues it tries to attend to.

There were flocks of people around but she looked through them and came to me and smiled her wonderful sweet smile and said &quot;You will be a wonderful woman of God.&quot; Her book is just like that. It breaks through the crowd and clamor of life and brings you to a place where God is personal and real.

I also encourage you to read this with \\"In God's Underground\\" written by her dear husband Pastor Richard Wurmbrand.Mother to Estee Li Li"},{"Title":"The pastor's wife","review":"I write this review out of some small sense of bewilderment, having noticed that there seems to be a stark difference between books about suffering Christians written in Europe and the US, and those written by Orientals. The book itself was well-written, succinct, and incredibly honest, although I suspect there were many brutal indignities that Mrs. Wurmbrand and her family suffered during their years in communist Rumania which she chose to keep private. My heart broke to read how cruel humans can be to one another, though I know it well from first-hand experience in a country where persecution is also used against believers, and I have lived through much of it myself.The Wurmbrands and their fellow believers suffered terribly, first under the hands of ruthless Nazi Germans, then later under the hands of the godless Communist Russians. I greatly appreciated her forthrightness about her and Richard's struggles and their real thoughts as they were enduring their many burdens. Yet, it pains me that the person, the reality of the Holy Spirit -- the Great Comforter and the Ever Present Help in times of trouble -- does not seem to be the primary focus of this book. The focus is on the human element of the Wurmbrand's lives. Wurmbrand writes of her fear, her sorrow, her physical pain (and I commend her honesty), but even as she devotes one line here and there to mentioning that God did many miracles for her and her friends, she only delves into a couple of them spread throughout the book. It doesn't seem to be her foundational purpose in writing to convey the goodness and faithful nature of the Living God. She does mention these things, but they seem to be more added to her narrative as more of an afterthought, rather than THE central element around which the rest of her story revolves. The Spirit-filled life of peace that passes understanding seems to be missing entirely. No mention of when Jesus spoke to her, laid an impression on her heart, or gave her dreams and visions to warn and sustain her, although she does mention that her son had many dreams.After they fled Europe, the Wurmbrands started a ministry to the persecuted church called Voice of the Martyrs. I have read so many of their publications, but I discovered the same thing in each of these: no mention of the Spirit-filled life with the abiding presence of Jesus for comfort and sustaining, and yes, miraculous provision in the face of humanly impossible circumstances. I wondered how this could be, when I compared it to other books written by persecuted Christians who convey their sufferings very differently. Ah, now that I have read the biography of one of VOM's founders I understand!Yes, read this book for an accurate look at the tactics and schemes of a regime which intends to stamp out the remembrance of Jesus/Yeshua -- and learn from these things as we believers in the West will very soon be under the thumb of a regime which will use some of the same tactics against us. Nevertheless, if you want to read stories of brutally persecuted Christians where the central focus is the Savior -- his goodness, his faithfulness, his daily abiding presence, his overwhelming power to dramatically change and transform a person -- this is not the book. For that kind of focus, I recommend two other books: \\"The Heavenly Man\\" by Brother Yun and Paul Hattaway and \\"If I Perish\\" by Esther Ahn Kim.The Wurmbrands lived lives of powerful testimony in their faithfulness to the Savior, and I honor them for this. I so deeply wish that I could have met them. Yet, I believe that our Savior beckons each of us believers to something more than the Wurmbrands apparently experienced (based on their own writings) -- a more intimate walk with Him and a powerful Spiritual indwelling of His Holy Spirit that will empower and carry each of us through impossible times."},{"Title":"The pastor's wife","review":"Sabina Wurmbrand lived an incredible and at times incredibly hard life. This is the story of a Rumanian woman facing persecution and her own sinful human nature by relying on her deep faith. I found the autobiography dark yet uplifting. Christian readers who want to read only happy \\"sugar-coated\\" books may want to avoid this one but then again maybe they should read it because it shows how high a price keeping the faith sometimes requires. People who still believe Communism was a positive thing should read this book, even many communists suffered under their own system. Overall, a great book!"},{"Title":"The pastor's wife","review":"I traveled in Romania with our church distributing Bibles in 1993, so that country has long been in my heart. I found the church in Romania to be alive and strong, and its members knew so much that we, in our comfortable churches in America have never learned-how to really love and trust God. The people had little in the way of life's comforts in 1993- my middle-class life in America in comparison was very rich; the orphans I visited in a boys home haunted me until I adopted from Kazakh and now from Latvian orphanages, but I will never forget them. This book will rock you out of complacency, and cure you, at least temporarily, of feeling sorry for yourself or blaming God for not doing what you want Him to do for you.

Besides chapters on installation and configuration, it also has an overview of HTML and some advanced web authoring techniques. The only drawback is that it will only teach you about setting up a Novell Web server (a fine choice actually) and so you won't learn anything about Unix or Windows NT servers. But that's to be expected since this book is a Novell product. Also, you will need to have a file server with NetWare or IntraNetware already installed, or access to one, before you can install the Novell Web Server 3.1 that comes with the book.

It contains mostly 'fluff' on basic web page stuff and covers unnecessary material all throughout the book.

Each of Streisand's films is given its own chapter, complete with lots of photographs(some never before seen). Spada soft-peddles some of Streisand's more chaotic battles with co-stars or directors, but many are present in interviews to give their thoughts. As with Spada's \\"Barbra: The First Decade\\", Streisand's music career isn't quite as fully explored as her movie work, and some of Spada's details are askew(David Bowie didn't write \\"Space Captain\\", for instance). Still, this is a very fine collection of photos and stories and must be included in any Streisand collection."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"A line from the movie \\"adaptation\\" put it best: this was a postmodern novel before there was any modernism to be post to.Simply put, Laurence Sterne threw out all the literary conventions of what a novel should be and how it should be arranged, a few hundred years before more recent writers like Calvino, Joyce and Danielewski did. The result is \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,\\" a gloriously rambling, richly entertaining sort-of-novel.\\"I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me.\\" So begins Tristram, who starts his life story with his \\"begetting,\\" and attempts to tell the story of his birth and life, as well as the descriptions of relatives -- his lovable uncle Toby, his eccentric dad, his patient mother (who's in labor for most of the book).But as he tries to tell us about his life, Tristram keeps getting sidetracked by all the stories that surround him -- his uncle's romance with the Widow Wadman and the war in which he received a nasty wound in a sensitive spot, the French, the doctor who delivered him, letters in multiple languages, the parson, the personal history of the midwife, and what curses are appropriate for what occasions.Most novels are pretty straightforward -- they have a beginning, a middle and an end.

Sterne was a creative genius, and pulled no punches when telling the story of Tristram Shandy, gentleman. Not only is this a shaggy-dog story, and a prototype for &quot;experimental&quot; writers like James Joyce and William Burroughs, but it is also a (remarkably early) meditation on the self-referentiality of literature, and the fine (nonexistent?) separation between a book's abstract textual form and its physical, material, paper-and-ink form. Like a good postmodernist, Sterne realizes you can't very well separate the two.You didn't like this book? Well maybe Sterne didn't want you to like it. Maybe likeability should not be the primary project of a text. One of the meta-statements Sterne seems to be making is he has no respect for your time, nor your desire for narrative cohesion -- and why should he? Defiant, Sterne is. Very defiant. Cool."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"There is so much in this novel one hardly knows where to begin, which is Sterne's hilarious problem for the first 300 pages or so. Tristram Shandy is a comic masterpiece, like Fielding's Tom Jones, which arose barely after the invention of the genre. Even Sterne's name almost seems a play on words and it's easy to see why great minds who followed Sterne like Nietzsche (Note &quot;The Ass Festival&quot; in Zarathustra), Samuel Beckett (Waiting for Godot), James Joyce (Ulysses) and J.P. Donleavy (Darcy Dancer, Gentleman, The Singular Man, Balthazar B., The Ginger Man, Saddest Summer of Samuel S.) admired immensely and were influenced by him. One has to love the way that Toby explains to Mrs. Wadman where he was wounded during one of her sieges of his fortress. One has to laugh at Sterne's tearing out of chapters, allowing the reader to pencil in his favorite profanities, making sense of pages of black ink, marbled patterns, blank pages and squiggled lines marking little ups and downs -- as obscure as the raw meaning of life itself. He writes chapters about whiskers, noses, buttons and nothing. I especially enjoyed the dedications to famous persons before several of his volumes. The epigrams were delicious and the careful reader is rewarded on every page for paying close attention to Sterne's often subtle comic style. Sterne certainly opened up the genre with an experimental literary style in which he created a vibrant, raucous, hilarious novel still relevant 300 years after it was penned. I can't say enough about the contribution of this comic gem to the literary works that followed, especially in Ireland. If you're a serious reader with a sense of humor, you'll be amused and enlightened by Sterne's intrepid wit."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I can't believe there aren't any reviews here, yet.

That was not usually an era of radical experimentation and, but Laurence Stern's TRISTRAM SHANDY is the oddest duck of English literature from that era. As the young gentleman Tristram Shandy sets out to write his memoirs and offer his views on life, he cannot help but going off on tangent after tangent. Only at the end of the second volume is he actually born. Soon the narrator basically gives up on his own autobiography, preferring to tell of the odd people around him. There is his eccentric Uncle Toby who, after being wounded in a siege at the turn of the 18th century, spends all his days constructing miniature citadels on his bowling green in which to play war games. There's his father, struggling to maintain the greatness of the Shandy family against his poor bad luck. And there is Parson Yorick, an Anglican cleric who doesn't always keep to the orthodox line, and so is a self-portrait of Sterne himself.The novel is revolutionary as literature, foretelling the narrative games and unreliable narration of 20th century Modernism. But is it actually fun to read? Sadly, I found TRISTRAM SHADY a wearying experience. This story based on digressions is woefully uneven, and for every laugh out loud moment there were two or three lame episodes. And this is from a reader who, equipped with his not ordinarily useful liberal arts education, understands all of Sterne's references to history and theology."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"A line from the movie \\"adaptation\\" put it best: this was a postmodern novel before there was any modernism to be post to.Simply put, Laurence Sterne threw out all the literary conventions of what a novel should be and how it should be arranged, a few hundred years before more recent writers like Calvino, Joyce and Danielewski did.

Sterne was a believer in association, and attributed to that the idea of the &quot;hobby-horse.&quot; This meant the menial quirks that each and every human had, such is the case with the sexual expeditions of the characters within. With the idea of human flux and the hobby-horse, we are brought to the &quot;marble page,&quot; which is, in and of itself, a hermeneutical circle for defining the rest of the book. Sterne presents this page to illustrate uniqueness of individuals and the unpredeictability of the process of writing. Which brings me to my next point, the concept of narrative failure. Throughout the strange goings on of the book, we come to points in the writing in which Sterne includes the reader into the disorder of the narrative. In Volume IV, Sterne mentions the process of the book in which he has done one year of writing, and yet come only to the first day of his life. This is the failure he is showing us, and the manner in which he creates this outrageous tale. These two aspects of Tristram Shandy are intrical in understanding and enjoying the chaos of this book."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I just wanted to note that pages 29 and 30 of this edition are supposed to be black, not blank. Whether this was a simple mistake by the publisher or just a way to save money-two black pages must take alot of ink-doing so alters the possible interpretation of Sterne's work. Given the fact that Sterne closely watched the original publishers to prevent deviations from his intent, I expect that Sterne would be appalled that the black pages were not included.Otherwise, I have no negative comments about the work. While many complain that the narrator jumps around to much and it is difficult to understand, that is part of the fun of reading the book. The narrator essentially makes the reader a character in the book-ground breaking methods which are way before his time.

I am writing a paper on Tristram Shandy for school and thought, hey, what the heck I'll listen to it in my car. Walter Shandy and Uncle Toby are characters that rank with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The phrasing and nuance that Lessor gives to Shandy actually provides more humour than you might find on your own. Your get the benefit of someone who has read the material several times and knows where all the jokes are, so you can benefit the first time around. Thoroughly professional preparation is demonstrated by Lessor. When Sterne writes --- or *** just what is a voice actor supposed to do? Somehow Lessor makes a great decision almost every time. That is what I mean when I say it is funnier than reading it on your own.

T.S. is not an easy read because it's nonlinear and the language style isn't what we're used to.

Themes discussed include for instance intra-uterine baptism and accidental circumcision!The running joke is that the reporter constantly digresses from his digressions and seems incapable of ever getting to his point. In this pseudo-autobiographical work, the narrator's birth finally happens only a good fourth into the book! Presumably, the intent is to be comical but the result is rather silly and even tedious to a modern reader.Published in nine volumes in the 1760's, the novel definitely appears unstructured. It ends without any true conclusion and one feels that many more volumes could have been written and published. Anyhow, there is no plot as such and, despite the title, little is actually learned about Tristram Shandy and his life. The main characters are really his father, a superficial man with very set preconceived notions on a whole series of subjects, and his rather pathetic and anti-social uncle, marked by his war injury _ in the groin!The author succeeds in being very original in a variety of ways: by very frequently addressing the reader, by limiting some chapters to a single sentence and even including blank ones, by making very long quotations in French and Latin or long pointless lists such as the number of streets in each of the various Paris neighbourhoods, etc.Overall, this book can only be recommended to those interested in the history of the British novel with a marked curiosity for atypical 18th century works."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"When Laurence Sterne, in 1760 wrote the first volume of TRISTRAM SHANDY in what was to be a series of nine, no one had any idea what this new genre of literature was meant to be. The only models that Sterne had were Henry Fielding and Samuel Richardson, so the field was pretty much wide open in terms of any competitor's choice of content, style, or theme. Sterne noted from these two that their successes were based on their characters' being placed in wildly varying and potentially threatening situations. He took these twin concepts of changeable location and possible harm which he incorporated into the first volume of Tristram Shandy, and then proceeded to turn the incipient world of novel writing over on its very young head. What differentiated this book from those of Fielding and Richardson was Sterne's abandoning the tidy world of the classical insistence on the need for unity. In a style that centuries later would be adopted by Joyce and Proust, Sterne twisted the relation between plot and time into a pretzel. To begin with, the title itself is a misnomer. The titular hero, Tristram, is not even born until midway through the book. He is born, appears briefly, disappears for lengthy periods of time, and then reappears briefly at the end. A more honest title would have been \\"The Life and Times of the Father and Uncle of Tristram Shandy.\\" It is Walter Shandy, Tristram's father and Toby Shandy, the uncle, who dominate most of the action. And it is not simply a misdirection of who the primary protagonist is to be that gives TRISTRAM SHANDY its off beat flavor. What distinguishes this book from both its predecessors and most of its descendants is Sterne's refusal to use structured time as the unifying glue.When Sterne presents his action in a manner that seems to defy the laws of causality in that results may precede causes, he does so by his novel use of the association of ideas which act to reconnect threads of thought that are snipped here and spliced there. Such cycles of snipping and splicing lead to digressions such as when in Volume II, the removal of Walter Shandy's wig leads his brother to be reminded of military tactics from his participation in a long past war. Such digressions take on a life of their own, like baby universes after the Big Bang with each one branching off to a possibly related clone. Sterne asks a lot of his readers to tolerate these rapid and often extended shifts in time and perspective. For those readers who are nimble enough of mind to follow, they are treated to some very comic scenes of humor that range from the broadest of satire to the most scatological of coarse jesting. By the time that Tristram makes his initial appearance, the reader has already learned to anticipate the many detours (some would call them roadblocks) of time and space that Sterne has inserted. Many of these scenes of digressive humor are so bizarre and pathetic, that the reader is not sure whether he should laugh or cry. And that perhaps is the magic that causes each new generation of readers to return and follow the twisted paths of time and space that even now can wring tears and laughs from them, sometimes in the same breath."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"There is a spirit of Tristram Shandy I am not sure I know how to define it. It is a making a game of everything in life including the writing of novels. It is a spirit of play which finds in the most commonplace things surprising reversals of fortune. It is in people who are stuck in their own character and for whom character is a gesture of repetition. It is for each and every thing not being where it should be, and not being what it should be but something else and different from what we expected it to be. It is an upside down turn around world where the child wonders what its parents were about when they begot him and the parents do not know why and where the clock in their hearts was ticking so fast at that particular moment.. It is much matter confounded with more mind, and above all that kind of surprise which makes us laugh.As one Amazon reader wrote even Sterne's name is a kind of fitting upside down crazy joke."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"No need for me to precise or set out plot, for if you read this review you may well have plodded through the 70+ reviews already available on the site, some of which do that in detail. (Possibly in itself the 70+ is an index of how popular this book still is.)Despite having heard a bit about it, twigging that it was a big joke, a shaggy dog story, I have to admit to not enjoying it the first time nearly as much I had expected to. However, I picked up some fabulous quotes, as well as timeless turns of phrase.Now I am reading it a second time, some years after that first read. This time I am enjoying it a lot more. I still find his ancient sentence form often confusing, and am sometimes left without understanding of his intent. But in the main I am picking up many more jokes than I did the first time around, and seeing in the dialogue particularly some delicious send-ups and gentle put-downs.There is one particular section, where Mr Shandy is talking of his desires for his new son, and a group of them get to discussing famous babies and how good they were at very young ages. Each tries to up the ante on the previous speaker by making his subject younger, until finally we get to one who describes how an infant gave forth some genius fresh upon birth. (Whereby Uncle Toby proclaims he should have been cleaned up immediately.) This sketch reminded me of the old Yorkshiremen in Monty Python, upping each other on the \\"we had it tuff\\" theme. I laughed and laughed. Now, I missed the significace of that at first read. So it has been well worth my while to take it on again. It suggests that as years go by I should aim to read it again and again.A true classic. Four stars."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Due to all the previous reviews, we know the plot and themes of this work: Shandy tells us his story while beating around the bush. He tells us about his uncle and other stories that he thinks are necessary to explain his own life -the joke is that he really doesn't tell us much about himself and what we do get to know is spread out over the entire book. He sees himself as unfortunate due to some events caused by circumstances not of his control -his nose is flattened, he is accidentally circumcised, he was named Tristam by accident and so on.I get this was written a long time ago and was a book pioneering the concept of a novel and it was supposed to be a comedy. BUT, I found it too difficult to read due to all the scattered plot elements and interjected stories that really had nothing to do with what I was trying to find out - Tristam's real own story. That's what was supposed to be funny - Tristam putting off his own life story. But, it irritated me more than anything to have to wait and wait and ride out the convoluted episodes.I like reading classics. The title of the book intrigued me. Others had given it great reviews, so I wanted to give it a shot. But, this was just not my thing at all. The writing style it was written in was too difficult for me to stick with. I don't want to give it less than three stars because I recognize this has merit and is a classic of sorts. But, it did not make it a fun read for me. I am taking the advice of others and will watch the movie version - and will also read the History of Tom Jones to see if I find it to be more enlightening."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"With &quot;Tristram Shandy,&quot; Sterne invented postmodernism 200 years before it supposedly was initiated by the likes Joyce, Burroughs and Pynchon. The book is hilarious. It is supposed to be the life and opinions of the narrator. Instead, it takes about fourhundred pages to even get to when he was born. The book radically changes tone in the last hundred pages (as, I think, Sterne was nearing death), and the then present day Shandy is finally presented. Some of these scenes are touching, but the final chapters become redundant. The book is completely inconsistent, the narrator interrupts at all possible times ... But it works! Read this book, but be advised to possibly skim the last fifty pages."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"While I had to force myself to finish it, placed in the context of 18th Century literature, this book has some surprisingly witty moments. Sterne is extremely self concious of himself as a writer, there are moments when he is speaking to the narrator that are both funny and confusing (it's hard to tell when he's speaking to the narrator). I would reccomend this book for those readers who are looking for a challenge and who know a LOT about 18th C. novels. Otherwise, you'll probably be bored and perplexed. It's a love it or hate it kind of book and there's a good reason why most literary scholars won't go near it. It was extremely popular when it was published, but as far I as know, only the connoisseurs like it now."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I first picked up Tristram Shandy when I was about 16. I knew nothing about it except that it was a Classic and therefore probably very boring. I was a big Kathy Acker fan at the time (still am, 14 years later) and liked the way she littered her books with strange pictures and diagrams. Imagine my shock on finding that Sterne had been doing the same stuff in the 1760s.Tristram Shandy is one of the earliest so-called novels in the English language, but it's probably the most astoundingly innovative work of fiction ever written. When a character dies, there's a black page. When Sterne wants to demonstrate the randomness of life, there's a marbled page (marbling being a random process in the original edition - the point is now lost in mass-market paperbacks). When a character makes a gesture with his stick, there's an extravagant scribble. I had assumed, in my Teen Ignorance, that your typical Penguin Classic was a sturdy but boring narrative about supposedly real people doing this and that at interminable length. The brilliance of Tristram Shandy is that Sterne displays totally credible (if utterly daft) characters in a proto-Dickensian manner, while at the same time asserting the material character of the book in your hand.I couldn't get academic about this book even if I wanted to. It's the most completely mad novel I've ever read. It's infuriating, yes, because Sterne is so good at the two things he's doing: telling a good story with living characters, and reminding you in his smirking whisper that it's only a story and that you're reading it in a book.This edition is as up-to-date as they get, and besides having comprehensive and very useful notes (Sterne is big into the tradition of Learned Wit, and many of his allusions can be a tad obscure without a modern scholar explaining them) it includes the excellent introductory essay by Christopher Ricks, carried over from the earlier (1967) Penguin edition. The UK price is three quid; it seems almost indecent that such a stunning performance can be had for so little.Dr Johnson famously remarked (in 1776) &quot;Nothing odd will do long. 'Tristram Shandy' did not last.&quot; Almost a quarter of a millennium later, it's still there, tongue thrust firmly into cheek. It's worth the whole of Fielding, Smollett and Richardson put together, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"This book is not for everyone. (Before you buy it, I recommend you read some of the other reviews for this book.) It is not an easy read, but it is funny in an odd **** ** ***. Please be advised that this book is more likely to make one chuckle rather than laugh.The story line is somewhat hard to describe. I take it to be a fictional autobiography-historical record-commentary on the people & places involved. The author, in my opinion, is poking fun at all of humanity in that each of us think our own life (regardless of our station) is so very, very important. Consequently we believe that everyone else should concur with our self-assessment and treat us accordingly.In a sense this book reminds me of a Woody Allen movie - it's superbly clever and wonderful at displaying the foibles of humanity, but it is completely vacuous in offering any solutions or good news. Allen and Sterne, unless I misunderstand them, are both cut from the same cloth of sugary post-Aristotelean skepticism.

Sterne's meandering style, with no sense of plot, and digression upon digression, can be frustrating to those looking for a story or any sense of a straight narrative.But for those who love word play, or, like me, grew up reading Mad Magazine and other satire; or anyone with a degree in Latin or philosophy, or even if you're a frustrated writer stifled over care to the craft, \\"Shandy\\" is the book for you.It's crazy fun -- missing pages, the infamous marbled page, black pages, drawings of pointing fingers, digression after digression on such diverse topics as armaments, noses, and fasting, and one of the most self-conscious, self-referential narrative voices in all of fiction. Literary critics point to Shandy as one of the first examples of postmodernist writing.Sterne presages the modern tendency towards meta-fiction, that blurry limbo between fact and fiction. The controversy over \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" reality television, the movies \\"Adaption\\" and \\"American Splendor,\\" along with the stream-of-consciousness style of Kerouac and the Beat Movement -- any work where the creator's ego/persona interjects into the narrative -- owes a creative debt to Tristram Shandy.I saw the movie and decided to read the book to make sense of it all. Of course, the book was no help. Sense has no place in the \\"Shandean\\" universe.

Lawrence Sterne accomplishes one of the most humorous and yet innovative and unbelievably complex novels in history. While the reader waits for Tristram to come to the world, the characters are introduced through the most delicious and sophisticated game with ideas, opinions and ambiguous expresions, which connect, for example, uncle Toby's hobby horses with sexual behavours and problems of miscomunication. Misunderstandings reveal the unaccurate nature of language in a time when the illustration worked hard on capitalizing all human knowledge through the enciclopedia. A clever parody of the ideas of its time is what Sterne delivers with humour and resourcefullness. I find this book to be even stranger than James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\", mainly because of its use of the page, in which he inserts lines representing the evolution of his tale, black spots, or he leaves a blank page so the reader can draw there. It is a truely memorable work of art, which everyone should read in order to put in perspective the literary works of the XXth century which are proclamed to be the most original pieces in history."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"This Dover Thrift Edition of The Life and Times of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen, is a handsome package in terms of size, cover, and ease of reading. It's one drawback is a paucity of the sorts of introductions, timelines, explanatory notes and addenda you find in Oxford Classic or Penguin Classic versions. In fact, there's only one brief introductory note, then you're on your own. But it's a fine way to read the novel itself, and a great value even at full cover price."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I wanted to like this, I really did. Sterne is a hugely inventive, hugely capable writer. Maybe he doesn't go in for the crazed linguistic free-for-all that people like James Joyce do, but he is every bit as bizarre and technically innovative. You could recognize one of his wildly digressive, over-mannered sentences in a heartbeat. But I still couldn't stand Tristam Shandy. Not because it's 'bad' per se, (parts of it are extremely engaging and genuinely funny in a way that very little writing from the 18th century is) but because it seemed like the work of a huge talent essentially screwing around for hundreds and hundreds of pages on what felt like, to me, a gimmick. Don't get me wrong, if modern literature has proven anything it's that huge, digressive chunks of text have a totally valid and at times, even stunning place in fiction and non-fiction alike. But a digression, however audacious or clever, is still a movement away from something, and Tristram Shandy doesn't really have anything to move away from, or back to. It's got no center. Maybe I'm not a conceptually ambitious enough reader to appreciate something this free-floating, but this book makes even the most fanatically post-modern fiction seem 'tame' by comparison. Tons of newer novels try to make it painfully clear just how decentralized they are, how utterly discursive and free from the confines of our often admittedly stodgy literary traditions they can be. Sterne wrote something that actually is those things, and while that might be clever on his part, it's just not enough. Not from someone who obviously has the chops to do so much more."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"It is curious to observe that the \\"novel\\" of the XVIII Century has much more in common with the novels of the XX than with those of the XIX. Structure, tone, introspection, playfulness, jumps in Time, typographic and other experiments, have more to do with the modern novels of the XX Century \\"isms\\", as well, of course, with the work of Rabelais and Cervantes, predecessors and acknowledged influences of this hilarious, humanistic and great book. The story presents tales within tales, and it \\"progresses\\" in spirals, with different threads interweaving like DNA chains which bring about a living being: Tristram Shandy. Through these games with Time, rhythm and direction, we learn not so much about the life and times of Tristram, but of his family. Well into the book Tristram apologizes for not having been born just yet, but we don't care because we are immersed in the prosaic yet magical world of the father, Walter, as well as of Uncle Toby and his servant, Corporal Trim, the male-midwife, the parson, Widow Wadman, and other characters as outrageous as the next. The book is a funny digression on subject after subject, some of them with no apparent connection to the main thread. We learn about Uncle Toby's and Trim's monomania for recreating, in the garden, the fortress sieges of William III's wars in Flanders and the Netherlands. Or the obsession of Shandy Sr. with big noses, whose size is related to other parts of the anatomy. The closing part is the story of Widow Wadman's efforts to conquer the naive Toby, similar to his sieges.The book develops in a continuous joy of digression, of pure literary pleasure, full of the most obscure erudite references worth reading in an annotated edition. The characters are perfect caricatures, full of humanity and good humour. Everything is subject of derision and mockery. One thing that makes it particularly memorable is the odd couple of Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim. Their absolute innocence, their boundless good faith, their devouted and manly friendship, make them a perfect British mirror of Don Quixote and Sancho, in their also perpetual assault on fortresses, as well military as temporal and verbal. A great ludic exercise of an obscure, and suddenly famous, parson from York, who has scandalized and amused generations of grateful readers."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I had to read Tristram Shandy for a class on eighteenth and nineteenth century novels, and I found Sterne's novel to be the most interesting and entertaining of the bunch.

It contains some hilarious premises (i.e. his father being obsessed with his family's noses and Tristram's nose getting smashed by clumsy forceps work during his delivery), but the digressions, which are the central conceit of the book and can be humorous on their own, dilute the fun to the point of making it a tedious exercise to finish it. The author is clearly impressed with his own cleverness but also has a sense of humor about himself, but this cannot get the book to a level of enjoyment that reading Dickens or Thomas Hardy always achieves. The recent movie Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story hits all the highlights and is pretty amusing - I would recommend it instead.

For those who are connoisseur-enough to understand that it takes patience, devotion, and a well-rounded understanding of vulgarity to get through an obra-maestra such as this, it is truly a fun read. At times I find myself daring to laugh out loud (lol) to Sterne's outlandish and fearless narrative. After such morally righteous (dull) tales as Pamela and Joseph Andrews, this novel is a welcome release. FINALLY here is an author who knows how to take charge of his readership and completely disregards their wishes while acknowledging and thriving off of their existence. Unlike the other little girly writers of his age who chew day and night on their anxiety of criticism, Sterne addresses his critics directly, super-manly, and does the most masculine thing of all: he makes fun of them.

Unfortunately Trisham Shandy did not live up to its reputation. Reading others review I saw words like Comical, Capricious and Deceptively Frivolous. I could find only a few pages out of the 500 that would justify these high praises. I found the book to start out slowly and then fizzle out altogether.My advice to those thinking of reading this book is to make sure that you have read all of the Voltaire and Swift that you can lay your hands on and then think of this one again."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Many things could be said about The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, funny, unique, and off-topic being a few of them. Personally, I would call The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy to be a rant of the longest degree. To prove my point, the main character isn't even born before the end of the second volume. It takes the character one year to write about one day in his life, so even if you enjoyed the book you would never get to read an end.To be fair, this is one of the first true novels ever written and is the very first stream of consciousness novel to ever be written. So with that in mind, it can go off once in a while on a rant because everyone does that in their own head once in awhile.The characters are rather creative, ranging from a king to a slightly strange mother, but the side trips get very annoying when you are trying to reach the end of the book. Do you honestly want to know what each person did months before the main character was even born? Do we really need to know what color this was and what Mr. Toby Shandy did to cause misfortune to his unborn son the moment he was conceived?Personally, this book was far too droning. I would much rather read something with more plot, and less stream of consciousness. I admit that maybe people would probably enjoy reading this book for its unique style, but I can not stand to read it. The tangents are too long and the overall style just isn't for me.With all that in mind, I say that The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy is a decent book with a good story to tell, and tell... and tell.

I'm quite happy with the purchase!"},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Composed long before there were rules about what a novel is supposed to look like, &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy&quot; is a visionary piece of literature, a book so original in construction it almost defies genre. Conceived by an Anglican vicar who, under the comic influence of Rabelais and Swift and equally informed by Cervantes and Shakespeare, turned to writing fiction later in his life, it is an inadvertent masterpiece, the product of a writer who just wanted to have fun and entertain his readers and ultimately entertained generations.The book is not a fictitious autobiography, although its narrator Tristram Shandy might have intended it to be; most of the story is concerned not with his life but with his idiosyncratic family and the circumstances surrounding his conception and birth, with many digressions on various related and unrelated subjects. His father Walter, whose conjugal duties coincide with his having to wind the clock the first Sunday of every month, compiles a compendium of information he calls the Tristrapoedia for the education of his newborn son. His uncle Toby, an expert in military architecture, rides a hobby-horse and occupies his time with the science of besieging fortresses. Other characters include Corporal Trim, a former soldier and now Toby's valet and factotum; Dr. Slop, a dwarfish physician who delivers the baby Tristram; and Yorick the parson, who naturally is descended from the infamous jester of the Danish royal court.There are two aspects to this book that distinguish Sterne's style. The first is that he provides several different channels of narration and never really settles on a main plot thread; he interrupts the flow of one narrative with another, delivering narrative flights of fancy like a marriage contract, a sermon, a notice of excommunication from the Catholic Church, a travelogue for France and Italy, and amusing anecdotes about extracurricular characters. In this way he presages the modernism of many twentieth century authors.The second is that he does not restrict his text to English words; he intersperses Greek, Latin, and French passages where he likes, and on occasion he does not even use words at all, but symbols and glyphs to express certain concepts. A cross appears in the print when a character crosses himself; a character's death is memorialized by a black page; a blank page is provided for the reader to draw (mentally or physically) his own vision of the voluptuous Widow Wadman, who has a romantic eye for Toby; long rows of asterisks and dashes are used for things that are better left unsaid. At one point Sterne even draws squiggly lines to illustrate the sinuosity of his narrative, celebrating his own whimsy.&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; was published in nine volumes over the last nine years of Sterne's life, and whether these were all he had intended is debatable because the narrative is implied to have neither a beginning nor an end; it seems very much like a work in progress. As such, by modern literary standards it may not be considered a novel, but in the sense of its unconventionality, its supply of so many bemusing surprises for the reader to discover, it is as literal an example of the term &quot;novel&quot; as there is."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"This work is OLD but reads like the most innovative avant-garde novel of today. The book is about Tristram Shandy and his birth, his uncle and his war wound and his father with his love of names and noses. Seriously! This is the original story-with-no-story and the beauty of the book is in the way that it's written. In reality, Sterne talks about anything and everything. He makes digressions lasting 20 odd pages, rambles to the reader, apologises for rambling, then discusses how he plans to get the story finally under way.The book is out of order chronologically. One of the funniest things about the book is that it's meant to be an autobiography of the fictional Tristram. Half the book is spent telling the story of the day of his birth. Then, the author moves to another scene, mainly revolving around Tristram's uncle Toby and the novel finishes several years before Tristram's birth.Sterne's writing is chaotic resembling a stream of consciousness. Sentences run onto the other, there's heaps of dashes and asterisks being used for various purposes. Sterne adds scribbles to signify the mood of the character. When one character dies, to symbolise his end, Sterne has a black page to describe it. When introducing a beautiful female character, Sterne says he can't be bothered describing her so he leaves a blank page for the reader to draw his/her own rendition.The book - though technically not a satire - in the process of going nowhere and saying nothing makes fun of many religious, political and societal topics. Sterne was a minister but from the book it can be gleaned that he was a particularly irreverent one.The work is divided into 9 books, published serially. This is a work where you can just pick up a chapter and read it. Some are several pages. Others are two lines. It takes a while to get used to Sterne's writing &quot;style&quot; so read slowly. This goes for the whole novel as there's so much hidden underneath the surface.This edition is great in having footnotes on the same page and reviews of Tristram as well as critical essays and Sterne's own letters about the work - many of which are very good.Tristram is funny, ridiculous, clever and very very eccentric. An absolute MUST!"},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"If you read and enjoyed Don Quixote, with its endless digressions and ridiculous situations, you are likely to enjoy reading Tristram Shandy. Even if you hated reading Pamela, you may still enjoy Tristram Shandy. \\"Learned nonsense\\" describes it very well. The demands it makes on the reader, however, are comparable to those made by works such as Ulysses, Gravitys Rainbow and J.R.. The Penguin edition contains over 120 pages of notes as well as a useful \\"Glossary of Terms of Fortification\\" to help the reader along. (You just never know when you might need to know what a \\"circumvallation\\" is.) All the same, I first read T.S. in the old Signet Classic edition, ($.95) which contained virtually no annotations, and I still enjoyed it. And then there are the strange neologisms (such as \\"hobby-horsical\\"), and the even sillier names. It gets better with repeated readings and it will make you laugh. After T.S., you may want to tackle Anatomy of Melancholy. My only disappointment with T.S.: there was no mechanical duck!"},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I'm so glad I didn't do English Lit at college. I've just read the customer reviews of this wonderful book and seen how being forced to read something you wouldn't normally read makes you bitter, twisted and intent on ensuring no-one else gets pleasure out of it. It also makes you cemented in your opinion that if you don't like it, it must have no redeeming feature (after, all &quot;I did a degree in Eng Lit, so I must know what I'm talking about&quot;). All great difficult books suffer from this -- Ulysses, At Swim-Two-Birds, Lanark, The Trial, and that's just the 20th century. Oh well. People should read what they want, when they want: they should also accept that there is little out there with no value, it's taste that causes us to like different things.That said, what do I think of it? I think it's one of the most fun reads there is, once you get yourself back into an 18thC mode of reading (MTV has so much to answer for with our attention spans). Also, forget all this bunk about it being postmodern or deliberately experimenting with the novel. When this was written, there WAS no novel, that came in the 19thC. Before this there was Don Quixote, Robinson Crusoe and little else that could be called a novel. All Sterne was doing was writing to entertain, and that he does marvelously. He had no boundaries to push - they weren't there - so he made his own (and they just happened to be a long way away from where he originally sat).Anyway -- if you like the idea of a book that coined the phrase &quot;cock and bull story&quot;, includes blank pages to show discretion when two characters make love, that draws wiggling lines indicating the authors impression of the amount of digression in the previous pages, you'll love it. But just stop if you don't like it, instead of perseveering and then taking it out on everyone."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"In a classic episode of The Simpsons, Grandpa Simpson gives the following advice of how to deal with some workers on strike: \\"We can't bust heads like we used to. But we have our ways. One trick is to tell stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for m'shoe. So I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt. Which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Gimme five bees for a quarter, you'd say. Now where was I... oh yeah. The important thing was that I had an onion tied to my belt, which was the style at the time. You couldn't get white onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...\\"Such a cock and bull story has formed the basis for a mighty novel, and one of the mid-18th century no less. That was not usually an era of radical experimentation, but Laurence Stern's TRISTRAM SHANDY is the oddest duck of English literature from that era. As the young gentleman Shandy sets out to write his memoirs and offer his views on life, he cannot help but go off on tangent after tangent. Only at the end of the second volume is he actually born. Soon the narrator basically gives up on his own autobiography, preferring to tell of the odd people around him. There is his eccentric Uncle Toby who, after being wounded in a siege at the turn of the 18th century, spends all his days constructing miniature citadels on his bowling green in which to play war games. There's his father, struggling to maintain the greatness of the Shandy family against his poor bad luck. And there is Parson Yorick, an Anglican cleric who doesn't always keep to the orthodox line, and so is a self-portrait of Sterne himself.The novel is revolutionary as literature, foretelling the narrative games and unreliable narration of 20th century Modernism. But is it actually fun to read? Sadly, I found TRISTRAM SHADY a wearying experience. This story based on digressions is woefully uneven, and for every laugh out loud moment there were two or three lame episodes. And this is from a reader who, equipped with his not ordinarily useful liberal arts education, understands all of Sterne's references to history and theology."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"\\"The Life and Opinions...\\" is perhaps impossible to really classify. It purports to be a biography of the fictional Tristram Shandy, but I don't think you can call something a biography when it only covers a year or so of the subject's life! I would say that more than half of the novel actually falls into the \\"Opinions\\" referred to in the title. The rest consists of short stories on Tristram's father, uncle, and a couple other minor characters.I have never in my life read so many digressions from the topic at hand, most of which were utterly irrelevant but the charm of it is that Sterne *knows* they're irrelevant, but mockingly expresses his license of authorship in forcing the reader to go off on these sidetracks. His attitude is: \\"If you can't wait a chapter or two to get back to the story, well, go take a flying leap, I'm the author.\\" Sometimes the digressions are exasperating. Very unlike Victor Hugo's signature habit of digressing, say when a certain main character in Notre Dame decides to enter the Paris sewers, Hugo takes thirty or more pages to give a history of the design and construction of the Paris sewer system. At least Hugo's digressions have *something* to do with the story.Well, maybe that's the problem. There isn't a main story in this novel. It's not a storybook. There are many short stories nested within the main framework, but there is no real protagonist or overarching theme of any sort. Indeed, the end comes abruptly and there is absolutely no resolution of any conflict.It's not trying to teach anything, really.So what is it? I'm not sure. More a comedy than anything else. Right up there with Dickens' \\"Pickwick Papers\\" in terms of humor, but lacking the story. Maybe funnier than Dickens and just as clever. I was rolling in the aisles so many times I lost count.I read the Penguin edition, edited by Melvyn & Joan New. The back cover does a better job than I could ever do in providing a sense of what you're getting into when you pick this one up:\\"No one description will fit this strange, eccentric, endlessly complex masterpiece. It is a fiction about fiction-writing in which the invented world is as much infused with wit and genius as the theme of inventing it. It is a joyful celebration of the infinite possibilities of the art of fiction, and a wry demonstration of its limitations.\\"It's a large work, it will take a while to work through. It's worth it.

It's not a book to rush through so that you can check it off on your lifetime reading plan. It's a profoundly human and wonderfully funny tale that needs to be savored. It was originally published in nine small volumes over a period of six years or so and no one at that time thought they had to sit down and read all nine volumes at once. This is a book you need to spend time with, pick up when it suits you or when you need to be refreshed and let one of the great writers in the language chat you up for awhile about the lovable Shandy family. Ignore the nonsense on the back of the Penguin edition about it being a novel about novel writing. This is a book about life. Two of its characters, Walter and Toby Shandy, rank with the best of Shakespeare, Fielding and Dickens. There are some truly great belly laughs, some really thoughtful philosophy and even a tear or two. Sterne's hobby horse theory is an extremely acute behavioral insight. If you give it a chance, you'll end up being very grateful to Laurence Sterne for adding such a beautiful piece to the literature of English speaking people."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"This is the only pocket edition of Tristram Shandy to get.

TS was published in four installments (nine volumes) and just throwing together various texts out of copyright, like the oxford edition, is not optimum (lots of printers' errors). On the downside, if you are thumbing through TS for a thesis like I am, this books' binding will fall apart.

A model was reading it and she had a really curious look on her face. I'm so glad I found out about this book. I really advise you to ignore the negative reviews about it being \\"self-consciously frustrating\\", pointless, etc. because it really isn't. If they simply didn't like it because they thought it was poorly written, that would be understandable, but it really sounds like they didn't get it and that they weren't open to the great pleasures of this book, which is pretty pathetic for English professors and students. It really isn't that hard to understand. I've only read a few of the classics before this, and the version I was reading had no editor's notes or explanations, but I had no problem understanding this book after reading the first ten chapters and getting used to it. I found it to be much more accessible then anything I've read by Shakespeare, anyway. I read somewhere a comparison to a Seinfeld in that it's \\"about nothing\\", but in a really humorous way. The book does have some jarringly post-modern elements, surprising for a novel from the 1700's (literally one of the first few novels ever written). In this it is unique because it is probably one of the only works of literature that can be thought of in modern times as both quaint and post-modern at the same time. But understanding this is not necessary to get involved in this book. It really is like an eighteenth century sitcom. There are mad digressions, stories within stories are started, delayed, started, delayed then forgotten about. There are quite a few genuinely funny moments where I laughed out loud as well as keen insights into human behaviour and the human condition, sometimes light and amusing and others melancholy.

Would you enjoy a story which takes many chapters before the hero manages to be born? This 18th-Century tale is touchingly told. The characters are real, and fascinating. It's not their fault that their story is frequently and impishly interrupted by outlandish \\"digressions\\" on the part of an author so creative that his modern descendants are considered to be Joyce and Beckett, as well as many others. Would you enjoy a chapter on Chapters? About buttonholes? About whether parents and their children are kin to each other? A chapter on curses? Poor Laurence Sterne has so much trouble getting two of his characters down the stairs that he finally calls in a \\"critic\\" to help! Advice on reading such an unusual, even unique, book: read the first several chapters, then stop and reread them. Continue that process and soon the book will feel quite familiar, and that's when the fun really starts. The Oxford World's Classics edition follows the first edition of the book, and is preferred. Amazon also offers the fully-annotated edition, the \\"Florida\\" edition, in three volumes. A caution about the Everyman hardcover edition: they reprinted a later edition which groups Tristram Shandy into three volumes, not nine. And then they renumbered all the chapters!

Before you begin to read this book you must first have read Don Quixote, and more importantly Henry Fielding's Tom Jones. No one should really even attempt to read Shandy if you have not read Tom Jones because Fielding's novel will at least \\"warm up\\" a reader to the writing style in Shandy. Also, you should be very aware of Locke and his views as they are deeply seeded into this novel as well. If you do not have a strong literature background, I do not recommend reading this novel as it will either only confuse you or you may miss very important aspects of Shandy. (Even an undergrad literature education is probably not enough for one to fully comprehend this work). However, if you do decide to read Shandy, make sure you have a good version of the book, I recommend the Penguin Classics. Of all the versions of Shandy which I have encounted I have found Penguin Classics to have the best Notes in the back of the book. Also, if you are going to read this novel, ***read the notes in the back as well, they are there for a reason and quite helpful.(Another important hint, research Sterne's life before reading this novel; one cannot fully comprehend a work without great knowledge of the author)"},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Sterne does indeed convey the limitations of fiction splendidly in this book. Tristram Shandy and the other characters here -- especially Tristram's uncle -- are also portrayed particularly well, since one gets to know them in the same way that one gets to know one's friends, that is, through haphazard, sometimes irrelevant, sometimes incomplete, stories about them that are not told in chronological order.In spite of these refreshing features, however, this book can be frustrating by the time one has reached the point of Tristram's birth, because, by this point, the magic has worn off. Sterne continues to play with the same narrative techniques he has displayed from the beginning of the book, But by now, one has grown weary of them and needs some tension to convince one to continue reading. If you've already got all of the meta-punchlines, so to speak, the rest of the book just seems like more of the same. Although I would strongly recommend this book, I have to confess that I left it halfway and would probably expect most readers who are amused by the book at the beginning to do the same once they have finished a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"I'm a college student and chose this book to read for a British Lit project.

By doing this, Sterne builds up and then frustrates our expectations, revealing Sterne as both vain in his self-indulgence and disrespectful to his gentle readers.

But if you want to read a good example of stream of consciousness you should move towards Virginia Woolf's &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot; Also Margaret Laurence's &quot;The Stone Angel.&quot; The only good thing I can possibly say about &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; is that it may be a golden turkey.

Sterne wrote a masterpiece and the surprising thing about this is that the book is as different from a novel as any can be. He uses more than one language in parts, he uses blank pages, and he skips from one topic to another, as the mood takes him. The book is a series of of character sketches, but the story about Tristram's Uncle Toby holds it all together. I think the genius of this book is Sterne's mastery of making one detail relevant to another. Sterne touches on all the elements of human life - Love, war, business, theology, religion, science, trade and medicine. Sterne juggles all these as well as his main story almost effortlessly. And parts of it will make you laugh out loud. The sketch that I found the funniest was Uncle Toby's abortive efforts to pursue Mrs. Wadman.

For some reason, Amazon has attached editorial reviews from the hardcover edition of the graphic novel version to this page.Now, the book itself offers a range of experiences from delightfully hilarious to annoyingly tedious. Lots of the \\"funny\\" parts depend on an understanding of 18th-century social mores. I'm sure some of it went over my head but I'm enough of a nerd to have enjoyed most of the drollery. I think...The story is whimsical, told all out of order by a scatterbrained, easily-distracted narrator. Tristram Shandy himself is hardly in the novel at all; aside from narrating it, he only appears momentarily as a newborn infant and then as a boy about 6 years old - and his role in both incidents seems peripheral to the carryings-on of the other characters. Each turn in the story reminds the author of something else, and he turns aside to tell stories inside of stories, each of which are necessary to give the reader some vital \\"background information\\" .. with the result that the main story hardly moves forward at all. It takes nearly 200 pages just for Tristram to be born! and even then the reader isn't quite sure it has happened since the conversations and minute actions of the other characters are magnified to such an importance that the narrator's own birth is hardly observed. For the most part this rambling comes across as \\"quirky and delightful\\" and the novel flows along quite pleasingly in spite (or perhaps because) of it. The digressions add layers to the story.Except when they don't. The \\"chapter upon noses\\" which is a translation of a fictitious(?) Latin work by the great Slwakenbergius, has little bearing on the story. Like most of the book, it builds up to a climax and then stops short of resolution, leaving you to wonder what was the point. It leads nowhere, but at least it was interesting. The same cannot be said of Book VII, which is a sort of travel diary of Tristram (in the novel's \\"present\\" time) touring France by post-chaise. Although this is the only significant appearance of Tristram himself as a character in the book, it has absolutely nothing to do with the story/stories he was telling, and it is neither very interesting nor very funny. It serves as nothing but a pointless interruption, delaying the reader for 50 pages before getting to the part we were waiting for: Toby's courtship of the widow Wadman.This last section goes along nicely for a while, and then the book stops. It doesn't end; it just stops right in the middle of a conversation, with the courtship unresolved and most of the reader's questions unanswered. This is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the entire novel, but I have to admit it's frustrating. I had trouble deciding whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars but I think it entertained me more than it exasperated me, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt ... and round up from 3.5. It's worth reading once, just for the experience - there's no other book quite like it - and the price of the Dover Thrift Edition can't be beat."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Peter Barker is a marvelous reader, and Sterne is a wild man writer.Something to be savored and smiled at over time.

All explore the human condition excellently, but none do it in as funny a way as Sterne. Within marbled and black pages, instructions to re-read chapters and descriptions of courtships as battles, we see not only Sterne going through the growing pains of being a novelist, but the novel itslef going through its own growing pains.

Indeed, the \\"Wake\\" would probably not have been possible without the comic freedom bequeathed to his descendants by the good Rev. Sterne. Influence aside, however, this is also one of the funniest and most impressive novels ever written IN ANY LANGUAGE.

If you never read another novel from the 18th century, try this one. It's a liberating experience and loads of fun."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"A line from the movie \\"adaptation\\" put it best: this was a postmodern novel before there was any modernism to be post to.Simply put, Laurence Sterne threw out all the literary conventions of what a novel should be and how it should be arranged, a few hundred years before more recent writers like Calvino, Joyce and Danielewski did. The result is \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,\\" a gloriously rambling, richly entertaining sort-of-novel.\\"I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me.\\" So begins Tristram, who starts his life story with his \\"begetting,\\" and attempts to tell the story of his birth and life, as well as the descriptions of relatives -- his lovable uncle Toby, his eccentric dad, his patient mother (who's in labor for most of the book).But as he tries to tell us about his life, Tristram keeps getting sidetracked by all the stories that surround him -- his uncle's romance with the Widow Wadman and the war in which he received a nasty wound in a sensitive spot, the French, the doctor who delivered him, letters in multiple languages, the parson, the personal history of the midwife, and what curses are appropriate for what occasions.Most novels are pretty straightforward -- they have a beginning, a middle and an end. But \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\\" totally ignores that, by having a beginning that lasts for the whole book, dozens of \\"middles,\\" and no real end (it just stops at a suitable spot). All of this is without a real structure.And he took this postmodern, break-all-the-rules mentality all the way, by including odd little illustrations -- when speaking of the death of Parson Yorick, Sterne includes a black page. Random empty pages. Asterisks instead of important paragraphs. And a bunch of squiggly lines to demonstrate precisely how the narratives in previous chapters looked.At first glance, Sterne's writing style was pretty typical of his period -- detailed, somewhat formal in tone, and very talky. It takes a little while for Tristram to start dipping out of of his narrative -- at one point, he starts interrupting himself in midsentence. By the middle of the book, he's completely lost control of his own story.And he twisted it around with lots of bawdy humor (such as poor Uncle Toby's groin injury, which causes quite a few problems), and the continuous comic stumbles of all the characters. On the subject of his own name, Tristram describes his dad's reaction: \\"Melancholy dissyllable of sound! which to his ears was unison to Nincompoop, and every name vituperative under heaven.\\")Life is too rich to be encapsulated in a single story -- that's the problem with \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" whose story is a classic comic delight of premodernist-postmodern skill."},{"Title":"The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman / by Laurence Sterne (The Modern Library of the world's best books)","review":"Dr. Johnson was wrong when he said that a work like TRISTRAM SHANDY was too odd to last. It's influence can be found in the works of Joyce, Woolf, and much of postmodern fiction. It's lack of a conventional narrative structure must have caused quite a stir in the mid 18th century. Even today, reading it can be quite disconcerting for one not comfortable with the colloquial English of the period.The book is narrated by Tristram Shandy, whose intention is to relate the story of his life beginning with his conception and birth. The running joke is that Tristram can't relate anything in a straightforward manner, and is continually digressing on subjects as diverse as philosophy, theology, obstetrics, travel, fortifications, sexuality, onomatology, and the human nose. There is a good deal of playful experimentation in the writing..shifting time frames, interspersing of English with Latin, creative use of punctuation and graphics, even deliberate omission of pages and chapters. Tristram is well aware of these quirks as he apologetically addresses the reader. At one point he draws a straight line to demonstrate his intended train of thought, and a squiggly line to show the actuality of it. By the time we are through, we have had some interesting portraits drawn of his overbearingly opinionated father Walter, his good natured but obsessive uncle Toby, and others.Lawrence Sterne, a clergyman by vocation, created something unique and entertaining for people who appreciate satirical wit and intelligence in their literature. For myself, I can't honestly say that TRISTRAM SHANDY was a great experience. At times it was hilarious. At times it's ideas were insightful. Too often though, it was dull and frustrating. Maybe a second reading would help, but I doubt it would change my opinion much."},{"Title":"Acrobat PDF and Workflow InDetail","review":"This book fills a BIG gap in the computer press - i.e. the lack of good books on Adobe Acrobat 4.0.

I bought it to learn how to tweak some advanced PDF settings for a large document job, and I am pleased to say it gave me exactly the information (compression settings etc) I was looking for.That said, I'm only giving it three stars. This is because the presentation of the book is not good. It has spelling and grammar mistakes. It occasionally references the wrong product (Acrobat 3.0?). The writing is verbose, and the logical structure of the book leaves a bit to be desired.It is also completely Mac-centric. It does not mention that its screenshots, examples etc are all taken from a Mac, which might confuse some Windows readers (they look pretty similar, but not exactly the same).

I have - like many of the other reviewers I am sure - read every one of Dickens' works including the unfinished Mystery of Edwin Drood. For sheer brilliance, Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Bleak House and in my opinion Little Dorrit. But for something transcending literature - a deep social and political commentary - try Hard Times. Plus you won't grow old trying to finish it as it's about 300 pages (220 in somew versions)."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens has an incredible energy that, after putting away a few dull contemporary novels, should be immeadiately striking to anyone. And with the wonderfully satirical opening of Hard Times, \\"Now, what I want is, Facts....\\" he continues to begin a book better than anyone. That energy does not dissapate as the novel progresses.Hard Times is set in the industrial but fictional Coketown. Its central point of concern is a certain ultilitarian/Victorian sensibility, a point of view that reduces everthing to rationality. This reaches is most tragic moment when a father must watch her daughter literally crushed by a \\"economical\\" marriage that he encouraged. Rationality also dictates the divisions of labor and class, that become dehumanizing.But while this book is satirical, and does have a social agenda, Hard Times can't be reduced to that agenda. It isn't merely a collection of opinions. There is too much here for that. Characters are shamed, outcast, forced into \\"sensible\\" but unfulfilling lives, and commit crimes while letting others take the fall. Unlike some of our contemporary satires, Hard Times doesn't just mock. There is heart and tragedy too. Further, no one, rich or poor, gets off the hook. Whether its Slackbridge the union leader and a group factory workers, or a wealthy banker, anyone who lacks humanity is shamed. Probably the richest and most aristoratic character, James Harthouse, is judged indifferently. Dickens isn't a partisan.Hard Times is the shortest Dickens novel and its brevity is a double edged sword. While one is not exhausted at its conclusion (As I was with David Copperfield), and there are less story lines to confuse, you a don't know the characters as well as you do with the longer novels, and the cast of characters isn't as wide. Also absent is some of the jolly or quirky characters that are Dickens staples. This accounts for why some call it a dreary novel, though I disagree.This isn't his best, and there will be some moments when you shake your head (why does everyone seem to die with perfect timing?) but Hard Times is still great. When I criticize one of Dickens' novels, I compare his low moments with his high ones, not to other writers. I will continue to read his novels and love their energy and wit."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"If you read Hard Times for the sole purpose of being entertained you will probably be highly disappointed. However, if you understand what was happening during this time period, you will realize that Hard Times is in reality, a long commentary. The Industrial Revolution was starting to show its down side. There was rampant poverty and disease, from the overcrowding of the cities. Children of the poor had to work long hours in unsafe factories rather than go to school. The gulf between the haves and the have-nots was very wide. The middle class was only beginning to be a distinct group.This then was the backdrop of Hard Times. Dickens is making a social and political statement. This is a statement against the mechanizing of society. It starts with Dickens repeated use of the word fact. It is facts that have meaning. Human conventions like feeling, compassion or passion have no meaning or looked down upon as an inconvienent waste of time. If a situation cannot be put down on paper as in an accounting ledger it should not be considered.This is where the conflict of the book comes in. Which helps humanity more compassion or fact. Is Bounderby a better person than Blackpool? Bounderby, who by his own admission was a self-made man. Untrue as this was he said it enough to make it his own reality. Or Blackpool, a weaver with an alcoholic wife, who was in love with another woman. Facts made Bounderby rich, compassion made Blackpool human.Louisa presents another conflict. Louisa was educated only by fact. No wonder or inquisitiveness was ever allowed. She was the perfect robot. Doing what she was told when she was told. Just another piece of the machine, however, the piece broke, emotions came out, and they broke down the wall of fact that Mr. Gradgrind had so carefully constructed. Because the feelings have finally been acknowledged things really break down. She finds that not only has she married the wrong man but also the man she did marry is a buffoon whom she cannot respect nor live with.The reader is left wondering if there is no one who will not be ruined by all the worship to fact. The whelp has certainly been ruined to the point he feels no responsibility to anyone but himself. If a situation can not be used to his advantage then he has no use for it, as a matter of course, he will run when he believes he will have to take responsibility for his own actions.The gypsies have not been ruined by fact. But only because they live outside of society, they do not conform to the rules of society. These are the people who value character over social status. The gypsies do not value Bounderby and Bitzer with all their pomp and egomania. Rather they value Stephen Blackpool and Cecilia whom can show compassion and kindness no matter a person's station in life.Hard Times can be used to look at today's society. Are we, as a society more worried about our computers, cell phones, faxes, and other gadgets than our neighbor's well being? Do we only get involved to help others when there is a personal benefit? Or, are we like the gypsies who can look into the character of the person and not worry about the socio-economic status? While Dickens' wrote Hard Times about 19th century England the moral can easily fit into 21st century America"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Charles Dickens visited Preston during a strike. So, this book is written largely based on his observations. People tend to go from one extreme to the other on this one. They tend to either really like it, or really dislike it. While it lacks the artful improvisation of some of his works like \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"Our Mutual Friend,\\" it is good in a different way. Right away, we meet Thomas Gradgrind who thinks that FACTS are the answers to all the questions in life. While he may seem harsh and brutal, he does have a conscience, and he honestly believes in what he does. We then meet Sissy Jupe and Bounderby. Sissy Jupe is pretty much the opposite of Thomas Gradgrind. She is one who hangs onto sentiment and hope. Bounderby on the other hand is the more dark and extreme version of Gradgrind. (Though it is hard to hate Bounderby because we can see the society that created him.) Through clever wording, Dickens describes the darkness and sadness of the area. Interestingly, the dark Bounderby has one notable redeeming feature. He is good to his housekeeper Mrs. Sparsit. We later meet Stephen Blackpool who has worked 12 years in Bounderby's factory. He is a good honest man who suffers because he can not go along with any extreme. He loves a woman named Rachel, but he is already married. (And of course the marriage is not a happy one.) Stephen then has a dream that foreshadows his fate. One of the most disturbing events of the book then takes place. Under her father's advice, the 20 year old Louisa agrees to marry the 50 year old Bounderby. (Charles Dickens could have hardly known that some time later he would marry the young Ellen Ternan, but we won't go there.) Later, we learn that Slackbridge is stirring up a mutiny in the factory and poor Stephen Blackpool is cast out because he will not join. And even Bounderby will not help poor Stephen. (What a situation!) Louisa (now Mrs. Bounderby) gives Stephen some money to help him, but Tom Jr knows that he can probably use Stephen's slowness to his advantage. James Harthouse starts to grow close to Louisa, and we can see the tension rising. The bank is then robbed, and poor Stephen Blackpool is suspected, but it doesn't take much for us to know who really did it. Interestingly, Mrs. Sparsit (Bounderby's servant) continues to use Louisa's maiden name. Louisa knows that her brother probably robbed the bank, but she can not bring herself to tell. The tension between Bounderby and Louisa begins to increase, and we can guess that the marriage does not have much longer. In a well written chapter Louisa has an emotional breakdown due to her upbringing, and the good in Thomas Gradgrind starts to show. His intentions were good, but he realizes he was wrong. (Thomas Gradgrind is not exactly a Murderstone or a Uriah Heep.) In a rage, Bounderby ships Louisa's stuff back to her father's, and we can see the marriage is over. But there is more to come. Stephen Blackpool is still suspected of robbing the bank, and fleeing did not help the situation. He makes his way back to proclaim his innocence, and he has a fatal accident. Poor Thomas realizes that his son robbed the bank. And in a moment of irony, the circus (that Gradgrind scorned so openly) is hiding his son. There is a brief and tragic reunion, and Thomas Jr is sent out of the country where he can hide in safety. And if it's any small consolation prize to Mr. Gradgrind, Thomas Jr does mend his ways. While the book does not exactly end in utter happiness, the characters do grow in a sense, so it does not end in utter sadness either."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I'm surprised by all the two and three-star reviews appearing on this site. For me, &quot;Hard Times&quot; was enjoyable right from the start and memorable long after. The writing is evocative and fluid, and although it can be easy to get lost due to some of the anachronisms in Dickens' writing, in general the writing is excellent. The characters, while not subtle (it's pretty easy to sum them up in a few words) are all memorable and tug on the heartstrings quite a bit. Sissy, Mr. Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby, Stephen, Tom, and Louisa are great characters (and just because they're easily defined, they are no less human or believable). Finally, the story itself is a bit sobering (as it was intended to be) but it's also very human and shows the possibilities of redemption quite nicely.In short, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is excellent. I'd recommend it to any fan of Dickens or just anybody who likes good literature."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I love the ending of this novel by Dickens when he says:\\"Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not. Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn cold and grey.\\"This novel is all about what one would think of as a dreary life in a north England mill town (fictitiously) called Coketown. It is named after the seemingly endless plumes of thick coal smoke being emitted from many different mills in this small lifeless town. But true to Dickens style he gives us a delightful set of characters that we can love or hate but who keep us entertained through a quick read of about 300 pages.There is method in the madness, in that Dickens tries to push us in the direction of accepting that fate was not preordained for these folks and they could choose a better life if they so desired. He includes many biblical references and references to the mid 1800 culture to keep it all upbeat and entertaining.I was expecting a more depressing plot to reflect the title \\"Hard Times\\", but in many ways it is good times for some of the characters, and as Dickens says at the end that he can hope for a positive outcome for their lives - the precise details of which he leaves us guessing.Entertaining 5 star read at a bargain price by a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"... of English literature? I read \\"Hard Times\\" -- the 1969 Penguin Classics edition, which I still own and which is still intact -- roughly 40 years ago, in the midst of a Dickens binge, and I'm surprised to find that the humor in it has gotten angrier from aging on my book shelf. The anger has a lot of targets: industrial pollution and ugliness, the smug hypocrisy of the wealthy, the connivance and impotence of lawmakers, the class inequity of the Law, the dysfunctional divorce laws of England, the inaccessibility of education for the poor, the 'utilitarian' social philosophy of the era, the sort of education that crushed a child's creativity under the thumb of intellectual conformity and economic utility. In fact, a lot of the humor of \\"Hard Times\\" is of the bitter, scornful variety -- no less funny for being preachy -- while the tirades of anger are bedecked and bedizened in the drollest caricatures and exaggerations, as if Mr. Pickwick were asked to expound the utopianism of Charles Fourier.But I admit that I had remembered \\"Hard Times\\" inaccurately. I recalled it as being a tale of 'labor agitation' in a mill town, rather like Emile Zola's great protest novel \\"Germinal\\". There is indeed a brief episode of labor protest, scarcely a chapter in the middle of the book, but the narrative focuses far more on the family affairs of the utilitarian philanthropist Gradgrind with his two children and the despicable mill owner Josiah Bounderby, boor, boaster, bully, buffoon. Gradgrind has raised his daughter and son, by the most systematic repression of their imaginations and sympathies, to be paragons of utilitarian values. The son inevitably turns out to be a self-centered scoundrel and the daughter a frigidly dutiful automaton. Gradgrind weds his beautiful young daughter to the far older and dictatorial Bounderby, and plot complications ensue. \\"Hard Times\\" encompasses three tales of woefully failed marriages, a thwarted seduction and hopelessly obstructed romance. There's really only one \\"working man' in the cast of \\"Hard Times\\" - the honest but 'limited' weaver Stephen Blackpool, whose eventual fate provides the pathos readers must have expected in a novel of 1854. The 'introduction' to my ancient Penguin Edition, by David Craig, perceptively challenges Dickens's own inability to assign a well-rounded self-determining 'humanity' to his lower-class characters, for all of his purported sympathy with their plight. Blackpool has the virtues of a victim only, a dumb beast. The circus performers, who appear in the novel at the beginning and who return at the end, are likewise morally admirable but incomplete. Frankly, if one stops too often to think about the reforming zeal of Charles Dickens, one can get frustrated with the man, especially when reading his earlier novels like Hard Times. He was, I fear, as hidebound in his assumptions of social class as anyone in Victorian England; he merely had a warmer heart and a much sharper pen. There's a brisk current of influence from the literary works of Dickens to the political and sociological notions of Progressivism, the Social Gospel, the Temperance Movement, and all the elitist reformers of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.Do not, however, let analysis of any Dickens novel inhibit your pleasure at the vitality and inventiveness of his words! That's another thing I'd forgotten over the years since my first Dickens binge: just how damned well the aptly-named \\"Dickens\\" could write!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"A book called \\"Hard Times\\" doesn't sound like the type of book you'd pick up for some light, cheerful reading, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - or its title either. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly deals with a difficult subject, but thanks to the genius of Dickens, it never becomes unbearably depressing.At the centre of the novel are the upheavals of the mid-1800s that changed the world forever: the rise of the Industrial Revolution, mass manufacturing and capitalism, and the rural-to-urban flow that led to compulsory schooling and shocking living conditions for vast amounts of the English population. The Enlightenment was gaining in popularity, as was the bourgeois class, which was gradually outing the old aristocracies. It was a time of drastic social and economic change, and inevitably many less-fortunate people fell down the cracks in the new system. With all this as his background, Dickens creates various characters of differing classes and the impact such social changes had in their lives. Exploring the phenomena on individual, familial and social levels, Dickens reveals some of the pain and misery that plagued his time-period, and is still very much relevant to our present day condition.What is vitally important to understand is that reading \\"Hard Times\\" is reading history - in more ways than one. As a philanthropist who investigated the factory conditions of the working class, Dickens not only vividly describes the situation as he saw it with his own two eyes, but threw light on the cruelty that was at work to the general public (before there was investigative journalists, there were novelists). It was partly because of the publicity that Dickens raised in regards to factories and workhouses that philanthropists came to the aid of the poor and that laws were passed in order to secure better conditions for the lower classes. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.Thrown into the mix of this great social and political satire are a range of vivid (though often one-dimensional characters) of all classes and situations who all dwell in the industrial town of Coketown, described as \\"a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it...a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.\\" Out of this miserable place comes Sir Thomas Gradgrind, a man uninterested in anything but facts - at school, at home and in life in general. His children Louisa and Thomas are the products of a strictly factually-based education; as a result she is clinically depressed (as we would describe it in modern terms) and her brother turns to cards and drinking in order to alleviate his boredom with the world. Among the lower-class is Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking older man who is in love with fellow worker Rachael, but because of his class is unable to divorce his drunken wife. Providing the lighter side of this dreary existence is the circus, which brings colour and enjoyment into the lives of the Coketown residents simply for its own sake, personified by Sissy Jupes, the daughter of a clown who brings a sense of fancy and spiritual understanding into the lives around her that mere facts don't even begin to provide.All of these lives, plus many more eventually collide in typical Dickens melodrama, with the clear message that imagination (or \\"fancy\\") and the need for simple pleasures in life are essential for the good of humanity. Whether it is in the strict classroom, the dismal workhouses or the familial unit, the human spirit will be crushed without some measure of light, laughter and enjoyment. As an extra bonus, \\"Hard Times\\" is one of Dickens's shortest novels; if you are a steady reader it shouldn't take you more than a week to complete!Some critique \\"Hard Times\\" as being too transparent in some of its themes and messages, and though this is probably true (with his characters representing different points of view, rather than being three-dimensional figures), this is precisely the point of the novel. Unlike \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\", this is not a story that revolves around one particular character and their development, but rather an assemble piece that has the \`hard times' as its main focus. Therefore, characters do not need to be anything but a representative of worldview; Mr Gradgrind as the strict rationalist, Bounderby as the hypocritical bourgeois member, Blackpool as the angelic poor man, Mrs Sparsit as a member of the fading aristocracy and Slackbridge as an ignorant trades-union agitator (proving that although Dickens had sympathy for the poor, he still believed that giving them *too* much power was a dangerous thing).These were hard times indeed, but this novel attempts to show that there is hope for humanity to see such times through to the other side."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"To write an outline of Hard Times or Dickens' work would not be necessary. His writing has withstood the test of time, and is well know. To give encouragement to would-be Dickens' readers and Hard Times readers does seem like time well spent.Hard Times ventures from other Dickens' books in the writing style lending a departure from Dickens' previous descriptive formats. In this particular book, Dickens lends skill, imagination, and panache to English language usage. He breathes life in to the language of the novel, and he remains a master of dramatic setting and story line. When people say, \\"Read good books, it will rub off on you.\\" Hard Times comes first to my mind. Therefore, a reason to read Hard Times would be to improve your own reading and writing.I admit some of the character's lives are depressing. When I looked back upon the entire book, and wondered if Hard Times would differ if set in present day with cell phones, PDAs, the Internet, electricity, airplanes, automobiles, and so many distractions. My guess would be - probably not. Would Louisa Gradgrind's life have taken a different course if she were living in today's world? My guess would be, perhaps, a slight shift on her circumstances, and, again, probably not. Dickens' charms include being able to put his finger on a character type and bring it to life. This is why I'd call certain present day figures, \\"A Mr. Bounderby\\" or \\"A Gradgrind\\". The Whelp or Tom Gradgrind remains alive and kicking; I've met him.My recommendation: Read Hard Times. You will be a better reader and writer for it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Although not one of his more popular novels, Charles Dickens' Hard Times still stands as a classic among classics. Carrying on with his highly prolific writing style, this novel is a bit more bleak than his other renown works, but enjoyable from the start, especially with Dickens' excellent choice of character naming.Suitable for most ages, this classic should not be passed up. And with the Norton annotations and notes, this edition will help readers understand better the context in which the author writes in."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times was written in 1854 by England's greatest novelist CharlesDickens (1812-1870. It is the shortest of his novels. The novel was originally published as a weekly series in \\"Household Words\\" periodical edited by Dickens. The novel reads quickly telling a story that is still relevant in our own post-industrial 21st century Western Society.The novel is set in fictional Coketown set in the English Midlands. The first scene is set in a classroom where children are being taught by rotelearning. Only FACTS yells Mr. Gradgrind who has raised his two children the feckless Tom and the more impressionable Louisa to eschew the emotions of art and the heart to stick strictly to practical learning.Enter into the town Mr. Sleary's circus. Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is a young girl whose father is employed by Sleary to ride horses. He deserts Sissy who is adopted by the Gradgrind family. Sissy befriends the lonely lass Louisa. Louisa is forced into a loveless marriage with the bloviating humbug industrialist Josiah Bounderby. Bounderby has crafted a false story of a difficult childhood while disdaining the love of his mother who lives in the country.We also met the tragic Stephen Blackpool a miner who is wed to an alocholic wife. Stephen is in love with the beautiful and kind Rachael. He will be framed for the robbery of Bounderby's bank which was really robbed by Tom Gradgrind.The novel is divided into three parts covering several years. Many of the characters come to a bad end. The novel attacks industrialism, the state of British education and the necessity for entertainment in the lives of everyone.All of Dickens fictions are worth reading. Hard Times is a good introduction to the second half of his career in which he moves to more serious themes. A Victorian classic which will be enjoyed by the discriminating reader."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens wrote some diverse plots, that's for certain. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly DOES portray some hard times. Everyone knows \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and I had read and loved \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" years ago. This book is something altogether different.Dickens has a knack for creating memorable characters. I had to read this novel for a British Literature class a year ago, and Bounderby, Sparsit, Blackpool, and the Gradgrinds are permanently ingrained in my mind.This novel would have been more enjoyable had my class been able to read it at a slower pace! Pay careful attention to the characters' development.Also, a word on the Norton editors: I really like the way they organized the additional material at the end of the book. There's even a reading by Darwin. It's all related; I think Dickens would have liked it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed.I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a \\"Uriah Heep\\" or \\"Fagin.\\" Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed.Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times is first and foremost a burning indictment on industrialism and the total reliance on reason without consideration for emotions. It is also a great novel. I didn't get quite the same connection with the characters as in Great Expectations - I can't readily recall their names after a few months - but I know them and can remember vividly the scenes that he painted them in.Again there are several sub plots which drive the point home and wrap the novel up in such a tight and well thought out way that only Dickens could have written this. The main character, for me, is Louisa, raised under conventional wisdom on only dry facts and reason. As such, she is completely unable to cope with real life. She is married to Bounderby, who owns the local bank while her brother, Tom, works for him. Bounderby claims to been raised in the gutter, abandoned by his parents, and to have raised himself up by his bootstraps. Each character has built for themselves a house of cards which are destined to come tumbling down revealing all the flaws, all the lies and the fundamental errors of their thinking. The only person left unscathed is the abandoned circus girl who, like Biddy in Great Expectations, reminds us that the people we overlook may just be the best ones out of the bunch."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I was forced to read Hard Times for my English class. Although I was skeptical at first, this book turned out to be pretty good. Dickens manages to create an engaging story with believable characters. He definately does an excellent job satirizing England during the Industrial Revolution. This book is not perfect, but is clearly a fine work of literature. A word of CAUTION: If you have a hard time reading wordy, descriptive passages in the Victorian writing style, this book is NOT for you! (I generally enjoy novels written during this time period.) A further note: If you are not assigned to read this book and really want to read some good Dickens, I would choose GREAT EXPECTATIONS, which I think is superior by far. Otherwise, enjoy the novel!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Coketown is \\"the inner-most fortifications of that ugly citadel where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into existence.\\"Hard Times takes place in 1854, six years after Karl Marx first published his ideas in the Communist Manifesto. Marx revolutionized the way people looked at history. His historical science was a radically new way of looking at human history, our past, our present, and our future. Marxist themes are plentiful in Hard Times, everything from the Bourgeoisie to the Proletariat are represented in this account of the industrial revolution.Dickens provides an excellent portrayal of real-life people faced with hard times amidst an economic boom. This is a touching story, giving names and faces to the people who are creating, being replaced by, and being abused by the industrial revolution. The Communist Manifesto is not complete until you have read Hard Times."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Still not a bad story, but rather more depressing than most of his books, there is very little to make this an enjoyable read, as Dickens usually is. Also, there is very little subtlety here; Dickens has a point (facts are not everything; there is more to life than practicality) and he hammers that point home repeatedly, making little effort to allow the reader to feel clever for having discerned the author's point. Most of the characters are caricatures, with the possible exception of Louisa; this is a flaw not unusual in Dickens' writing, but it seems more noticable and blatant here than in some of his better stories.Worth reading, but not excellent."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I just finished this book, it is the third of Dickens novels that I have read. It is one of his shortest so it was easy to get through reading it in a decent amount of time. I enjoyed the characters he introduced, but I found myself getting a tad bit lost in some of his phraseology trying to figure out what was being said and understand exactly what was going on. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this novel of Dickens, but the one thing I do like about Dickens is you can't breeze through any of his novels without putting some effort into concentrating on what is being said-or else you get lost! This being said, It isn't the most light hearted of his novels, but If you enjoy reading Dickens, you will most likely like reading this one, too, even if it isn't necessarily his best one."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I read this book later than I read novels such as Great Expecatations and David Copperfield, but I don't remember it as well. Hard Times is a fine novel - short, often miserable (but that's the reason why this novel is so important), but with a good message. It's also an effective satire that actually does have its moments of humor as well as pathos (such as when Stephen Blackpool dies). I do recommend it, but as good as a book it is, it'll never be one of my favorite Dickens novels."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"\\"Now what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life...Stick to the Facts, sir!\\" With this opening, Dickens shoves his message down the gullet of the reader of Hard Times which is indicative of the entire story line, characters, and the social message that he is trying to shout out to his audience. The book is an allegorical message in every sense of the word where his descriptions of the character's physical traits bring their personalities to life. Dicken's description of the story's setting, Coketown, and those who live and work there, also illustrates the bleak and dismal attitude surrounding the Victorian Era and the changing social structure of the time.The tale begins in a school, barren of the delightful faces usually evident in children, due to the staunch efforts of Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. M'Choakumchild, the proprietor and schoolmaster of Coketown's school. Their quest is to instill nothing but facts into the children of Coketown \\"until they were full to the brim.\\" They attempt to create an environment in which no child will be allowed flights of fancy or fits of imagination. The fruits of this quest are strongly apparent in Gradgrind's own children, Thomas and Louisa, who are encouraged to learn facts, and not allowed to participate in activities that other youths would see as a necessary part of life. Following their education, the two are given over to the control of Mr. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed, self-made man, proud that he has pulled himself up the \\"corporate ladder\\" and into a better life than he claims to have come from. Louisa becomes Bounderby's wife at the insistence of her father, and Thomas, an employee at Bounderby's bank. The one wild card added into the equation is Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus performer who has abandoned his station in life and his daughter, as well. Gradgrind takes in this pure, young soul in order to prove that his methods can be used to teach respect and proper behavior, even in a girl raised in an environment such as the one in which Sissy has been raised.Along the path, Dickens introduces some of the other residents of Coketwon, including Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking, virtuous man who lives in misery due to bad choices made in his youth. His friend and co-worker, Rachael, is also hardworking and honest, and although there is romantic interest evident, Blackpool's unwise decisions of younger days keep them apart. Also mired in the plot is Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby's house keeper, and a truly despicable and pathetic character. And last in the line of detestable characters that Dickens adds is James Harthouse, an upstart from another place whose sole purpose in the novel is to wreak havoc on the lives of the others while remaining absolutely clueless to his part in their misery. The story continues as the characters trod along in their lives with only suspicion that there is another way of life, until Dickens casts his redemption spell in the form of Stephen Blackpool's martyrdom for society and Sissy's powerful moral character that affects Harthouse so strongly that he leaves Coketown.Throughout the tale, Dickens so strongly exerts his opinions and hopes that at times the book left me feeling ambivalent towards almost every charcter introduced. And his use of language, although allowing the tale to be vivid in the mind of the audience, also makes the reader wonder if he wasn't being paid by the word, rather than by the page."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"The fact that Dickens wrote \\"Hard Times\\" in weekly installments, more than probably means that there was a time and space constraint. It must not be a coincidence then that this is among his shortest novels. I suppose this is why at times, his characters wind up being caricaturesque, and not as complex and real as some of his other very memorable characters. By the same token, some of his subplots do not fit in to the main plot the way they do in most, if not all, of his other works.Dickens is trying to explore and provide us with a picture of the effects of utilitarianism on different types of human characters, and in my opinion he does a good job, but only as far as individuals go. We can see the impact of the post romantic victorian social system on all of the novel's characters, and this makes the book interesting. The downside, however, is that when Dickens tries to extrapolate and paint a picture of the social struggle going on, he falls quite short. He tries to oversimplify too much, and in my opinion, fails at that.The \\"nothing but Facts\\" system psychologically castrates most of the main characters in the book. In one way or another, they all have their share of \\"Hard Times\\", and this can surely be attributed to a dehumanizing system, where people are statistics or simply gears within the machine which represents the newly industrialized world.It is no surprise that there are absolutely no happy people in this novel. This is definitely not one happy book, but overall it's really worth reading. If what you're looking for is a book that easy to read and to understand, and a page-turner, just stay away--read John Grisham instead ;-). If you want to read Dickens, this is more that probably not his best, but it's still good."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Considered by 19th century critics to be one of Dickens' more artistic and literary triumphs, Hard Times can be viewed in present time as a blistering polemic against the rise of industrial society and the dominate philosophy that rose in tandem with the industrial age, utilitarianismIt is well known that Dickens was a chronicler of his times, and his mode of expression, the novel. An intensely emotional individual, Dickens was known to be a power walker, starting in the afternoon, covering miles, to return home just before sunrise. It was during these extensive walks that he witnessed the utter poverty and squalor scattered throughout the streets of London. These walks brought inspiration for many of his novels, particularly, Hard Times.In this novel, Dickens explores the applications of utilitarianism in its highly rational, and in many ways, brutal forms. The novels general theme is that a philosophy that is only concerned with happiness and survival for the majority, will attempt to quash any and all individual thought and effort. Individual ideas, emotion, imagination and creativity must be ruthlessly rejected in order for the majority of people to think alike, work alike and behave alike to attain a status quo of happiness for all. Rationality must prevail because imagination promotes individuality, which is anathema to mob concerns.This polemic against utilitarianism is expressed clearly and persuasively in the practice of education. In the opening chapter for example, \`The One Thing Needful\\", the reader is introduced to this dictatorial emphasis on the rational:\\"Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will be of any service to them.\\" (p. 47)Romanticism was now on the wane and utilitarianism and the rise of rationalism infiltrated every aspect of 19th century industrial life - emotion has no place in capitalism - the masses are reduced to statistics.Dickens main point in writing Hard Times, I believe, was to illustrate the brutality of the applications of the philosophy, utilitarianism, and the destructive results it entails when humaneness, the vital aspect of our nature, is ignored completely. Dickens was reporting, and speaking against a potentially destructive sway in society away from basic humanity and the importance of the individual, towards the highly mechanical and rational \`mob' philosophy of Utilitarianism during the Industrial revolution.In our so-called modern times, Dickens message continues to be relevant. Our societies emphasis on rationalism and the exclusion of emotion, can only lead to destruction. A balance must be found."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"A most interesting book, and not the &quot;downer&quot; one might expect from the title. The story begins with the issue of what might happen to children raised in a setting where the non-logical human qualities are repressed. This is blended in with the relationship dynamics of those who own the factories and those who make the factories actually produce something to sell. Further, related issues are added. These various topics are intermingled in a moving story."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Despite the explicit title, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is not so much an ode to poverty and misery as it is a commentary on the increasing impact of industrialization on the fragmentation of society and on the dehumanization of education. The result, as Dickens implies, leads to lives hollowed by the emptiness of work for work's sake and wealth for wealth's sake.The setting is Coketown, a factory town befouled by industrial smog and populated by underpaid and undereducated laborers. The novel's most prominent character is one of the town's richest citizens, Josiah Bounderby, a pompous blowhard who owns a textile mill and a bank and whose conversation usually includes some boastful story about his impoverished childhood and the hard work that led to his present fortune.Bounderby is the commercial projection of Thomas Gradgrind, a local schoolteacher and an extraordinarily pragmatic man who instills in his students and his own children the importance of memorizing facts and figures and the iniquity of indulging in entertaining activities. Gradgrind offers to Bounderby his son, Tom Jr., as an unwilling apprentice, and his daughter, Louisa, as an unwilling bride.On the other end of the town's social scale is Stephen Blackpool, a simple, downcast man who works as a weaver at Bounderby's mill and slogs through life misunderstood and mistreated. When he refuses to join his fellow workers in a labor uprising, he is ostracized; when he criticizes the economic disparity between Bounderby and the workers, he is fired and forced to leave town; when Bounderby's bank is robbed one night, he is suspected as the thief. So halfway through the novel, Dickens grants his reader an interesting, albeit somewhat contrived, plot element to embellish the narrative.If this novel contains a ray of sunshine, it is in Sissy Jupe, a girl abandoned by her father and adopted by Gradgrind, whose oppressive educational method nearly breaks her. However, she grows up with her own intuitive sense of propriety, which she uses as a tool to eject a dishonorable character from the novel. Her strong and independent spirit will allow her to do much better in life than Louisa, who withers away in an unhappy marriage, and Tom Jr., whose boredom renders him vulnerable to temptations.Compared to his other novels, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is relatively short and straightforward and has few characters, as though Dickens felt that what he had to say was so important, it had to be said quickly and bluntly. He is less interested in realism than in making a point, and it's really the poetic power of his prose that enables him to get away with the overbearing sentimentality and often ridiculous caricatures that accompany his poignant human truths."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Some critics go so far as to say this is not an important part of Dickens. In my opinion this is a serious error. If anything, this is one of his best creations. The characters are plausible. In addition, the passages are dramatic and chilling. Dickens also fills this work with suspense, powerful images, and dramatic irony. Not one page is wasted. Don't let the thin length of this book fool you. This is a phenomenal masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"As a previous writer said, this is probably not the easiest Dickens novel to read, as it lacks the charm and appeal of the more popular works like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, but it still occupies an important place in Dickens's oeuvre. It is basically an expose of the evils of the unrestrained capitalism of the period, as Dickens portrays the lives of the poor who are held captive, oppressed, and ultimately crushed by it.In this book, although it speaks mostly from the oppressed working class and lower middle class, characters from all walks of society mingle. Although Dickens describes the dismal and oppressive working conditions of the time, the economic realities really take a back seat to the intimate story of the families, and of their trials and tribulations and failures.Fallen, old-family aristocrats like Mrs. Sparsit serve crass, nouveau-riche boors like Mr. Bounderby, whom she despises, and criminals and even circus people have important roles, such as in the case of Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a clown. The characters, however, aren't formulaic stereotypes but are real people who love, hate, make mistakes, fail, and live to regret and apologize for their mistakes.The novel takes place during the second phase in the industrial revolution which led to the development of the power loom. One of the main characters, Stephen Blackpool, is a power loom operator, and the new productivity of this device put many formerly skilled, manual loom operators out of work, further worsening an already bad unemployment situation.Gandgrind, the schoolteacher, is a rationalist representing the 18th century enlightenment ideals, and his philosophy of \\"fact\\" is shown to be a loveless and dispiriting sham. His views are ridiculed by Dickens, and his daughter ultimately rebels. In a sense, the novel is as much about the false and destructive ideals and beliefs of many of the main characters as it is about the economic vicissitudes of the time.Dickens's stories about the conditions in the factories and the lives of the workers were an important influence in changing things for the better. Eventually, England passed laws restricting child labor (to 11 hours a day), redistricting the so-called \\"rotten bourroughs\\" (whose seats in Parliament were sold by the wealthy landowners), and chattel slavery was abolished in the early 1830s, although economic slavery continued to exist in the form that Dickens depicts it in this novel. Laws were passed that didn't limit election to Parliament to landowners, and the stage was set for a fairer representation of the worker's interests.The Chartist labor movement attempted to obtain justice by smashing the looms and machines, but it ultimately failed to achieve its goals. The later labor movement was more successful in calling attention to the plight of the workers and in creating badly needed changes.By the way, an odd piece of trivia on Dickens that I read once. Just as today, back in Dickens's time even otherwise intelligent people believed in all sorts of pseudoscience. One of these was the supposed effects of magnetic fields on biological organisms, which still persists today. It was thought that if one slept with one's body aligned with the earth's magnetic field, that one would reap significant health benefits. When Dickens came to America to go on a speaking tour, the maids who came into his hotel rooms were surprised to find that he had completely rearranged the furniture so he could align the bed north and south with the magnetic field. Dickens kept a pocket compass with him so he could do just that.Unfortunately, there is no basis for such a claim although speculation about the health benefits of magnetic fields persists today. Also unfortunately for Dickens, it's too bad that there were no real positive health effects, otherwise he might have lived longer--his exhausting speaking tour wore him out and he became ill and died soon after returning to England. I've also read that he was paid $100,000 for this tour--an enormous sum of money at the time."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickins was a master of satire. He routinely lampooned the social structure of his time. Hard Times deals with the philosophy of utilitarianism. You can enjoy this book without any history lesson but for full effect read a little about Jeremy Bentham, James Mill and his son John Stuart Mill. You will undoubtedly notice the parallels. This book savages the unthinking, uncaring effects of unchecked capitalism. I'm no Marxist but this book is a fine arguement not just for balance in economic thinking, but in our daily lives. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Here is a stunning indictment of soot-covered early Victorian England. Its relevance today though should not be underestimated. Parallels abound both here at home and the world over. Hard Times is brilliant and multifaceted. Dickens is both dreadfully serious and stingingly witty. And yes, a thorough Marxist reading is certainly possible. Dickens cared deeply about the world in which he lived and his humanity shines through in every line. This book, and all that Dickens wrote, is worthwhile if only for the beauty of the prose. Those forced to read it in school are unlikely to see its value as anyone forced to do anything against the will is going to be resentful and rejecting. Be deeply suspicious though of the reader from Madison Wisconsin, Hitler, or anyone who advises the literal trashing of books."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This review is for the audio book narrated by Martin Jarvis. This is one of the better audio books I've listened to in a while from the perspective of the narrator doing excellent voice characterizations. Jarvis was able to make each character sound distinct and they each sounded just like I would have imagined. Bounderby was thunderous, Tom Gradgrind sounded like a whelp, and Blackpool sounded meek and humble. It made for an enjoyable listen that made it very easy to follow the characters.I've always been a fan of Dickens and have read most of his books, but this was my first time through \\"Hard Times\\". As with most of Dickens novels, the characters are almost caricatures, but this method does a good job of pointing out human strengths and weaknesses. This is a short novel for Dickens, but still did a good job exploring the impact of what would happen if science is emphasized too much over emotional education.He once again highlighted the problems with class distinctions in English society at that time. I like how his humble characters have more wisdom than those that are rich or of high social position.I highly recommend this audio book as a great way to be introduced to Dicken's \\"Hard Times\\"."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown.

It's definetely not Great Expectations or David Copperfield as the entire thing is depressing, morose, and a bother to read. Dickens throws in characters that don't furthur the plot (do I hear paid by the word?)The characters aren't real, I mean nobody could be worse off than Stephen Blackpool; the allusions are driven home, the Bounderby as wind motif; and its basically hammered out. Luckily, its the shortest one of Dicken's works and I wouldn't recommend any teachers forcing this upon students...it will make them flock to their nearest Cliff's Notes retailer (Amazon.com...) in droves.

I find his works good, thought-provoking books that are free of cuss words, violence, and lusts. I think this book was a realistic account of what life was like in the early nineteen hundreds. I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved. Overall, I think this is a good book, and I would suggest that you read it. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book has the feel of something thrown together to meet contractual agreements or to pay the bills. There is a passel of things in the book which are inconsistent or unsatisfactory. The continued presence of Ms. Sparsit on the payroll after she has been made redundant; Blackpool's reason for defying the union; and Sissy in her entirety, for instance.Still, this is not a bad tale and parts of it are enthralling.What I found intriguiging was the obliquely described opium session between the cad and the whelp; Dickens' use of the word 'noodle' as mid-1860's vernacular slang; the mention of walnut ketchup which is still being made today and is something that I should like to try; and an introduction to a pretty decent alcoholic drink, to wit warmed sherry with lemon peel and nutmeg.I used cream sherry to make a concoction very much like a smooth-edged hot toddy; it comes highly recommended to anyone in need of a hot toddy.What I find I like even more is plain, unheated, cheap cream sherry and lemon peel which is a surprisingly excellent combination.Having said that, this book did re-introduce me to the spice nutmeg which is heady indeed--the Chinese would call it 'heaty'--and deeply satisfying."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I liked the service and it got here very quickly, but the book itself really needs to be laminated almost if you actually want to use it, otherwise it looks very used, very soon."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I initially lamented the fact that Hard Times was assigned to me in my British lit. class. I had read some of Dickens's melodramas like A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and enjoyed them, but everything I heard about Hard Times said this was nothing like those. This was supposedly just strictly social commentary. My interpretation of that: BORING.But then I read it.Hard Times isn't like Dickens's other novels, but I don't think that it has any less heart than those masterpieces. In fact, Dickens endured himself much further to me with this novel as he has his characters perform Thomas Carlyle's enduring philosophy.The novel follows the Gradgrind family who is raised adhering to FACTS and living in a society which worships the manufacturing machine. As the novel progresses, connections are made and broken, and the characters come to the realization that there is much more to reality than the material facts.Hard Times is told so compassionately. The reader cares for these people and their tragic lives. The story is also told with biting humor that still cuts at today's society (this novel feels really modern), and the underlying philosophy is one which is so needed in our post-modern world. I would certainly recommend this novel to fans of Dickens and to fans of the truly literary novel."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"\\"Hard Times\\" belongs to the second half of Dickens's writing career, in which his work becomes rather more somber and, by common critical assent, more mature and satisfying. Personally, I prefer his earlier work and his very first novel, \\"Pickwick Papers\\", is to my mind his greatest. Surprisingly, \\"Hard Times\\", despite its title and reputation, contains some brilliant flashes of Dickens humour, especially in the earlier part. The descriptions of Bounderby and Gradgrind, and the early dialogue with the circus folk, are genuinely hilarious.This is Dickens's shortest novel, about a third of the length of each of his previous four. Themes, subplots and characters are introduced without being fully explored. The author was perhaps feeling the constraints of writing in installments for a periodical, although he was well used to doing that. This relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.There are the large dollops of Victorian melodrama and the reliance on unlikely coincidences that mar much of Dickens's work. Also the usual tendency for characters to become caricatures and to have names that are a little too apt (a teacher called Mr. McChoakumchild?).The respected critic F.R. Leavis considered \\"Hard Times\\" to be Dickens's masterpiece and \\"only serious work of art\\". This seems to me wildly wrong, but such an extreme opinion may prompt you to read the book, just so that you can form your own opinion.I read it because I had just finished \\"The Jungle\\" by Upton Sinclair, which deals with the plight of Chicago factory workers, and I wanted to compare the two. Sinclair's book has greater immediacy. It takes you much closer to the suffering of the workers. In the Dickens novel, the mill workers and their plight are distanced; they are relegated to being the background to a family drama, which is what really interests the author. A third, and still greater work, that examines the same themes, is Zola's \\"Germinal\\". I recommend all three. Together, they give real insight into the social conditions that led to the proletarian political and revolutionary movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens creates a novel that virtually revolutionizes literature of the 1800's. At a time where most writers wrote in a stuffy prose full of unrealities and a jaded outlook, Dickens dares to tell with honesty what he sees through his window.Hard Times has yet a misleading title. It gives one ideas of harshness, depression, poverty, and social decline--although the actual reality of then-London, still not something you would choose to read. However, Hard Times has as much depression and poverty as any of Dickens' other works. It is just in this case that Dickens chooses to remind the world that in the deepest despair there is beauty yet to be seen.Dickens was a strange author. In his supposedly inspiring books, you get an overdose of sadness, and in his depressing books, you find beauty. It is this case with Hard Times.It is a poor, honest man's search for justice in a world where only the rich have merit. It is a girl's search for true love while battling the arranged marriage for money. And lastly, a woman's search for recognition against her favored, yet dishonest brother. It is these searches that at last come together and become fufilled. And, while at the same time telling a captivating story, it comments on the then--and still now--presence of greed and total dishonesty one has to go through for money.The title of this review sums up Hard Times. Its beauty comes from the pure searches for truth, the sorrow comes from the evil the characters most overcome to get there, and the honesty is both the truth with which Dickens portrays life and the the overwhelming truth that these protaganists create.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych. ProfessorGeorgetown University, Johns Hopkins Inst."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Always concerned with issues of class, social injustice, and employment, Dickens shows in Hard Times, written in 1854, a broader concern with the philosophies and economic movements which underlie those issues. Three parallel story lines reflect a broad cross-section of society and its thinking.Mr. Thomas Gradgrind runs a school founded upon the principles of rationalism, a belief in the importance of facts, the antithesis of romantic \\"fancy\\" and imagination. Basically a good man, he denies the importance of emotion--for himself, his children, and his students. Only Student #20, Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus clown, fails to conform to his notions, and in a hilarious, satiric scene at the beginning of the novel, Dickens shows the absurdity of Gradgrind's teachings.Gradgrind's friend, Mr. Bounderby, is a banker and factory owner, aged fifty, who claims to have risen from the gutter to his present lofty position through hard work. Bounderby treats the employees of his Coketown factory as machines, rather than as humans, and his eventual marriage to the teenaged Louisa Gradgrind is seen by both as a marriage of \\"tangible fact,\\" having nothing to do with affection.The third story line involves Stephen Blackpool, a worker in Bounderby's factory, trapped in a marriage to an alcoholic who periodically appears and extorts money from him. Stephen is in love with Rachael, an adoring factory worker, but his appeal to Bounderby for help in ending his marriage is met with cold, rational pronouncements. Shortly after, Bounderby fires Stephen \\"for a novelty,\\" forcing him to seek employment elsewhere.As the story lines overlap and intersect, often with consummate irony, Dickens keeps a light enough hand to prevent the story from becoming a polemic, though his criticism of hypocrisy, corruption, and \\"progress\\" at the expense of humanity is clear. His humor, often dark, keeps the plot moving, and several of his characters, which are often caricatures, do grow and change. Characteristically, Dickens uses names symbolically-Gradgrind grinds the emotions from his graduates, hires Mr. M'Choakumchild as a teacher, and lives at Stone Lodge. Mr. Bounderby proves to be a bounder. Some of the circus performers, like Sissy, live at Pegasus Arms.The dramatic conclusion, which involves the pursuit of an innocent character widely believed to have committed a robbery, draws all the themes together, showing the parallels, contrasts, and ironies which connect these characters, regardless of their social level. Less epic in plot than some of Dickens's other novels, Hard Times provides an intimate look at a changing economy and an important commentary on the philosophies of the times. N Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This is Charles Dickens.Charles. Frikken. Dickens.There's no way that any self-respecting booklover, as I style myself to be, can take a Charles Dicken's novel and tell you that it's &lt;shudder> boring, or even not all that great. Unless the book lover in question happens to be a particularly honest one who doesn't mind the Dicken's squad clicking \\"unhelpful\\" over and over again...Let's proceed.Hard Times begins promisingly, as it slams the education system about as hard as I've ever seen (and almost as hard as it deserves), as teachers Gradgrind and Choakumchild (yeah, I know) try to throttle the imaginations of their charges and fill them instead with sand-dry \\"Facts.\\" But then, Hard Times loses the trail of its narrative, following one of the school kids for a while, then another couple of kids, then another character, then another.... It skips around so often for so long, introducing one character or another (and pausing for social commentary) that it seems as though it might never develop a plot.Near the end, it does take on a plot utilizing all of its developed characters, and the energy of the novel picks up considerably, but less-hearty readers will likely have given up long before then. One of the current \\"Spotlight Reviews\\" for this novel currently states: \\"[The] relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.\\" No, no, no. A million times no! It's not that the novel is awful--it's decent, despite the dismal pacing of the first three quarters, and some of the comedy is gold (Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is precious!)--but this is *not* a good novel for children, most of whom won't have had enough experience with real-life Bounderbys or perspective on formal education to fully enjoy the satire. This is not the novel to use as an introduction to Dickens for just about anyone, let alone a young reader.Unless, of course, you have sympathy with M. Choakumchild's pedagogical philosophy.In the hands of a child, this novel will likely stifle any appreciation for classic literature, Charles Dickens, and perhaps reading, itself, that might otherwise develop. Start with A Christmas Carol--it has ghosts--and then move on to A Tale of Two Cities--all around better book (and it has decapitations!). Hard Times is for mature, well-read individuals who want to see \\"what else Charles Dickens wrote.\\"A decent novel with some genuinely great moments, but on the whole fairly dry. As with medication, a blessing and a boon to mankind, it's best to keep this out of the reach of young children."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"HARD TIMES has its own special place in world literature, even as it does in Dickens's own oeuvre. Its brevity contrasts with the longer works for which Dickens is more famous, and its satiric skewering of rampant capitalism leaves an imprint on the reader's mind not soon forgotten.Dickens holds up Thomas Gradgrind for us, Sir, a singular member of the industrial community of \\"Coketown,\\" a man who is so obsessed with Facts that he never allows his children to Feel. They are to \\"discard the word Fancy altogether.\\" To ensure this strict materialistic philosophy, the children are taught by a schoolmaster named \\"McChoakumchild.\\" In Gradgrind's friend Josiah Bounderby Dickens gives us possibly the most layered, complete and abhorrent hypocrite in all of English literature. Moliere's Tartuffe is the height of sincerity compared with Bounderby, who seems really to have convinced himself of his own myth after many years of browbeating others with his pompous false modesty. The fact that he is a factory owner who mercilessly exploits his workers only makes him the less endearing. And this is the man Tom Gradgrind gives his daughter to in marriage!The book's narrator clearly distinguishes the good guys from the bad guys, all in an effective effort to show that humans need to appreciate sentiment and sympathy much more than they need to worship dollars and cents. In 1854 HARD TIMES showed the triumphalist British industrialists their dark side. It stands today as a treasured statement against cost-benefit ratios and anti-intellectualism in a world where CEOs \\"earn\\" $10 million bonuses the same week 4,000 workers lose their jobs. It will stand tomorrow anywhere people are scorned for showing their feelings, beaten down in body and spirit, or victimized by rank injustice."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This novel, like much of Dickens, is hard to pin down in a concise statement as to what exactly it's about. Dickens is often accused, by his critics, of being a sentimentalist and two-dimensional character scrawler. This judgment, I would submit, is quite correct as far as it goes. But the greatness of Dickens, it seems to me, is that each one of his novels conveys a feeling, envisions a world, that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This is especially true of Hard Times.The most common interpretation of the book is that it is anti-utilitarian. This take on the novel is quite true, to an extent, but to say that this stance constitutes all that the book concerns is, in itself, a utilitarian interpretation! It reduces the book to a fictionalised polemic. And the book is surely far more than that!There are always, in Dickens's works, depths opening up amidst the simple plots and the simplified (and whimsically named) characters that bring one to a stop. When Louisa finds out from her brother Tom that Bounderby (the most deliciously named character herein) is set to propose marriage to her, the chapter ends thusly:\\"Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he has spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\\"This passage alone should serve notice that something deeper is going in the world of Coketown. I truly don't think I can proffer to the prospective reader a glimpse of the depths that lie beneath the simplified characters and simplistic narrative structure than by quoting the last words of Stephen Blackpool, addressed to his Muse-like Rachael, as he lies dying, after having been raised from the disused mine opening known locally as Old Hell Shaft:\\"I ha' fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o' old folk now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives - fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an' hundreds...When it were in work, it killed wi'out need: when \`tis let alone, it kills wi'out need. See how we die an' no need, one way an' another - in a muddle - every day!\\"Coketown, perhaps, resembles our own world a bit too much for our own comfort and self-satisfaction. Look at the tag on the shirt you are now wearing. It was most likely made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop by a human being, with hopes and dreams much like your own. More importantly, for the significance of this book, gaze out into the world around you where people die, \\"thousands an' hundreds\\" every day, for no particular reason other than that they fell in a sort of shaft or hole: financial, medical, physical.Why is Coketown, why is the world as it is, with no apparent rhyme or reason? Why is it, in short, a muddle? That is the deeper question which Hard Times leaves us mulling: Why must they always exist?"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens was a great rhetorician, but not a very deep social thinker. _Hard Times_ is the novel in which he tries to tell us that there are a Whole lot O' Things Wrong with Britain in the nineteenth century. You've got people living in wage slavery! You've got educators who can't raise their own children! You've got amoral, rakish aristocrats! You've got unprincipled politicians and businessmen! When Dickens is taking on each of these subjects individually in his other works, he's wonderful; when he sews up his complaints against them into one big bundle and convinces himself that it's a Social Theory, he's a tiresomely shrill satirist and all of his characters turn as flat as paper before one's very eyes.This doesn't, of course, mean that the book isn't worth reading - after all, it's Dickens. There are some very sweet and descriptively rich passages about a traveling circus and although one finds it difficult to give a hoot about any of the characters aside from Mr. Gradgrind (who might have been developed much more richly if Dickens had cut down on the windy deploring a little and worked harder to make him seem like less of a cipher) the plot thunders along at the usual absorbingly breathless pace. But if you haven't read _David Copperfield_ or _A Tale of Two Cities_ yet, then for God's sake don't start out with this relatively second-rate effort."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"In this novel set in industrial revolution era Great Britain, Dickens is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Unlike some of his other social commentary, where he wraps his point in a gripping, twisting, and entertaining plot, Dickens goes right for the jugular in &quot;Hard Times&quot;.In this novel he lashes out against the dehumanization of our children through &quot;education&quot;, as well as the still very real gulf between the well to do and impoverished. Even the names of his characters are none-too-subtle jabs. The local teacher, Professor Gradgrind, seeks not to educate or enlighten, but to hammer home facts and turn his children into automatons. His counterpart in the business arena is Bounderby, a blustering, egomaniacal, and ultimately vacuous man. Their countermeasure is a young orphan girl named Sissy Jupe. She is a lovable character that embodies compassion and humanity, but is very nearly broken by the their overbearing influence.This is not a &quot;fun&quot; book to read, and if you're looking to be entertained in traditional Dickens fashion I strongly reccomend looking elsewhere (i.e. David Copperfield). The novel is relatively straightforward and simple of plot, and his scathing social commentary cannot be missed. The most compelling reason to read &quot;Hard Times&quot; though is the fact that the same mentality criticized here is still very much in existence today, and this makes the novel just as relevant for the 21st century as it was when first penned."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This product had a few marks where passages were underlined but overall it was in very good condition. It made it to me in good time and the process was easy."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Studying this great Victorian novel for A-Levels, I couldn't have been more surprised at how captivating and entertaining Dicken&#8216;s is."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I love all the Norton Critical editions of literature. Not only do you get a handsomely presented copy of Hard Times, but articles and criticism about the work in one package.For me Hard Times becomes the indispensable Dickens. The relationship between Sissy Jupe and the Gradgrind children is something that is relevant today as it was 165 years ago. That the Education system can ruin children is absolutely a point that needs to be addressed in modern times. The Gradgrind academy only cares about facts, and only turns out vacuous twits. Only Sissy Jupe comes out of the academy with a head on her shoulders. Young Tom Gradgrind shows the folly of removing morals from the schools. He has no understanding of anything but how to take advantage of any particular situation. What is worse, his Father Old Tom Gradgrind tries to cover for him. How is that not relative to today's world?Besides getting the novel, one also gets the critical articles in the back, which help make sense of the whole thing. I am not saying that Dickens, in any of his works is hard to understand, but I especially like the articles from the time period in which the works were written. For teachers of literature, this book is a must. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I needed this book for a college class.

Ordinarily I like Dickens but now I simply couldn't figure out what each event had to do with each other, nor did I understand the end. However the single segments, especially those with Louisa in them, were interesting. It is even funny reading the beginning of the book when Mr. Gradgrind teaches that imagination is useless and only facts are important. If you want a fluid book that is more this type of story,read Great Expectations,which is not my favorite book but it certainly makes more sense. Personally, my favorite Dickens is Oliver Twist."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"_Hard Times_ is a familiarly sentimental work by Dickens. This is especially the case regarding the character of Sissy Jupe, an overly sweet, innocent young girl who is abandoned by her father. Dickens seems determined to tug at the heart strings with this character.Dickens does an admirable job in covering new ground concerning the factory owners and bankers exploitation of the poor, as well as exploring the beginnings of labor unrest in 1850's England. There is much for the factory laborer to be unhappy with in Cokestown, where the factories belch out dirty, polluted smoke all day long. Dickens combines these issues with his examination of the difficulties inherent in parenting and gives truth to the old adage that how the branch is bent, so grows the tree. Through much grief and contrition years later, school master Thomas Gradgrind learns that a cold, no nonsense approach to bringing up his daughter Louisa and his son, Tom, was wrong. Louisa has a good heart and dotes on her younger brother, but is otherwise very distrustful of humanity and exists in the world suffused in apathy; Tom is simply, as Dickens calls him, \\"a whelp\\", and a dishonest one at that. Louisa marries Josiah Bounderby, a banker who turns his nose up at the factory hands and mocks their aspirations to move up in the world. Bounderby refers to these individuals as trying to put a \\"gold spoon\\" in their mouths. The actions of Bounderby and the Gradgrinds directly lead to tragic consequences for Stephen Blackpool, an honest and courageous loom worker, who merely chooses not to be involved with the townspeople or their labor leader. Another old truth that there is no justice in the world is as real today as it was in Dickens' time."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book isn't Oliver Twist. This book reminds me of Animal Farm, only not as comical, but the social commentary is the same. What would the world be like if children were raised without that magical sense of wonder and pretend? What was the world like before the working class was not respected for all the hard work they do? Those definately would be hard times. This is just the scenario in this book. In this book, Coketown is a hard place. The factory workers toil day in and day out yet get no respect from &quot;civilized society&quot;. Louisa and Thomas Gradgrind are raised with books and facts and no room in the world for emotion, and then Sissy, a carnie orphan, enters their world as each spiral in different directions due to their upbringing. What happens? Hard times indeed but in the end, the human spirit triumphs even if not everyone gets to see that wonderful ending."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive.

There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],D={key:0},H={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const L=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-6d38ef2a"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/17.md","filePath":"library/17.md"}'),q={name:"library/17.md"},R=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(L)]))}});export{O as __pageData,R as default};
