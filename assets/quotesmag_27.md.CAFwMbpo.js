It's not like slasher movies -- all blood and gore and no content. It's a book about brutal people, both gangsters and politicians, who will do anything to keep their hands on the power that they've managed to get hold of. The Continental Op, Hamett's anonymous detective, finds that the only way to clean up Personville is to join the fray, and though his conscience bothers him, he fights fire with fire and matches the scummy crooks machiavellian move to machiavellian move. What makes the book tick is precisely the bleak, realistic, nihilism of its main characters, who remind one so much of real politicians and crooks, but without any of the spin-doctor sheen that covers their tracks in the media. Red Harvest is a book I read every couple of years to marvel again at fantastic writing and the no-nonsense view of humanity's common, unadorned, ugliness."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The Continental Op is, as far as I'm concerned, the most interesting of Dashell Hammett's characters. He's a middle aged fat man employed by a national detective agency similar to Pinkerton (which Hammett worked for before turning to writing). As such, he's nominally bound to rules which he generally follows, but breaks in this particular case.His client is murdered before he meets him, and hired by the client's father to find the murderer, finds himself in a totally corrupt community basically run by the mob. Though he easily finds the murderer, he stays on in the father's hire to clean up the town, spurred on by the actions of one of the corrupt law authorities.The story is engrossing, and the implications are even more so. The corruption is so deep that it affects even the main character. The theme common to most Contintinental Op stories is here: Everybody lies and the only way to get at the truth is to create your own lie.Every tough crime story needs its love interest, and this one is very believable in that you can see why she is drawn to this middle aged fat man and why he can find her acceptable. You also realize why he's withholding his feelings both from himself and from the reader.While not Hammett's most read novel, it's definitely expertly crafted and one quite rewarding to read."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Not just a detective story. This is a true work of literary genius. The Continental Op's crusade to clean-up Poisonville is an exploration of ethics and morals in America. Hammett's lean, edgy style is as modern today as it must have seemed in 1929. A must read after reading all other Op stories, as well as a treat for the &quot;reading ears&quot; of anyone searching for inteligent prose."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"RED HARVEST arose from a series of short stories Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) wrote between about 1923 and 1927 that featured \\"the Continental Op,\\" specifically an operative for the The Continental Detective Agency, San Francisco office.Hammett has to jump through a lot of narrative hoops to consolidate these short stories into the novels RED HARVEST and the slightly later THE DAIN CURSE, and the result is often excessively convoluted; readers often have to turn back several pages to figure out who has done what. Even so, both novels continue to crackle today, and in creating them Hammett not only essentially created the American P.I. novel, he also developed a uniquely sparse, often brutal, yet often poetic style. To say that both accomplishments have cast a long shadow indeed would be a profound literary understatement.RED HARVEST finds the nameless detective summoned by newspaper publisher Donald Willson to Personville, a mining town crammed to overflowing with corruption of every variety imaginable--and before the Op can meet with his client Willson is gunned down in highly suspicious circumstances on Hurricane Street, not far from the home of notorious good-time girl Dinah Brand. It happens that Willson's father Elihu Willson, who founded the city, is now a captive to its corruption in more ways than one, and after the Op settles the question of who killed Douglas, the Op blackmails the old man into allowing him to clean up the town.The Op seldom plays by law-and-order rules, and his solution to the problem is both clever and direct: he creates a series of situations that sets the various crime bosses at odds. Before you know they are gunning each other down in the streets, leaving both the Op and Dinah Brand to do some mighty frisky hopping in an effort to stay clear. But can they, when there are so few easy ways out?A mixture of alcoholism and politics cut Hammett's career short; his short stories aside, he produced only five novels, and critics are quick to point out that THE MALTESE FALCON is his finest work. I would agree with that, but while RED HARVEST may be less smoothly written, it has the unexpected energy of a great talent's first major work, and that more than makes up for the occasional rough edge in technique. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Dashiel Hammett, author of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN, certainly deserves credit as one of the originators of the noir genre. Unfortunately RED HARVEST doesn't live up to this reputation.RED HARVEST starts with the Continental Op arriving in the mining town of Personville (sometimes called Poisonville). He has been hired by the editor of the local paper, who turns up dead. This editor is also the son of mining magnate Elihu Willsson, who had called in a collection of hooligans to break a strike. What he had not foreseen was the inevitability the criminals would take over the town.Originally I had the idea the \\"red\\" in the title had something to do with the socialist workers movement or the Wobblies, a logical assumption since Hammett was a communist, but Hammett settles for the obvious, the red meaning murder after murder as the Continental Op turns the criminals against each other.A blurb on the back of the book lauds Hammett for \\"sharply and economically defined\\" characters. They're sharply defined all right, so sharply defined that they all run together. Pete the Finn, Lew Yard, Max Thaler and Noonan, the chief of police, could be the same character. At the beginning of the novel, the Continental Op learns the history of conflict from Bill Quint, an I.W.W. organizer from Chicago, but that's pretty much the last we hear from him.About the only interesting character in the whole book is the femme fatale, Dinah Brand, but her sole motivation seems to be money.Hammett also has problems with resolution of conflict. When painted into a corner, he simply kills off another character.Even the Continental Op is pretty much a cipher. He doesn't seem to have much of a background, other than that he's somewhat afraid of the Old Man, who runs the Continental Detective Agency. We know he smokes and drinks too much and even takes cocaine, but other than that he doesn't live up to his cool name. Unfortunately all of this reads like a bad comic book. Even Hammett would have a good laugh at what the New York Times said about RED HARVEST, I would assume in 1929 when it was published: \\"RED HARVEST is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain.\\" I'll give him two stars for noir dialogue, but the rest of it is pretty much dreck."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"While this novel may have an important place in the history of crime fiction it is simply an awful read. The plot is convoluted and the violence is over the top. If you were going to read only one Dashiell Hammett novel please make it The Maltese Falcon which I have read over and over."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I do despise the whole concept of books on audio, primarily because the reader almost never matches my concept of a book's narrative voice. (Elliott Gould's comatose renderings of Phillip Marlowe, as an extreme example, make me want to &quot;hurl my lunch over the fence,&quot; to borrow a phrase from Raymond Chandler.)And so I was in no way prepared for William Dufris' reading of Hammett's grossly underrated &quot;Red Harvest&quot;; Dufris caught me completely by surprise with his sure sense of pacing as well as his deftness in shifting from character to character in his voicings without resorting to caricature.Most importantly, however, there's the sheer insightfulness he brings to his reading: For all the times I've reread this novel, I had never been quite able to figure out the Continental Op's true motivation behind his instigation of what leads to wholesale carnage. Dufris, in his delivery of one key line in the first third of the story, crystallizes the man's motive. (And no, I'm not going to tell you the line; listen to this superb reading for yourself.)So yes, I hate books on audio . . . but here's one I'll readily listen to time and again. I definitely recommend it, particularly to anyone who has previously read the novel. It's an eye (and ear) opener!"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This engrossing story will keep you hooked as the Continental Op slyly orchestrates a clean up of Poisonville by any means necessary. The plot of Red Harvest takes you through more action and mysteries than 10 other crime fiction novels, so if you solve one crime you've barely got the time to pat yourself on the back before the next one. Well paced, and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"From the moment the book begins,with the reference to Hickey Dewey of Detroit who called his shirt a shoit and Personville Poisonville to the last words in the last chapter, this is probably the best book in ANY genre of writing ive read. Even the chapter names are great. Theres enough gore in it for the blood thirstiest reader and enough class for professors of English literature. Read this and any current action novel will read like a Mills &amp; Boon romance!"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Despite what Europeans say, Americans do have a culture all their own. This is proven by the existence of our own myths, legends, tall tales, archtypes. One of our most repeated myths which you will see repeated in fictions of all kinds, be it films or books, is that of the law coming to tame an uncivilized society. It is merely a shadow of that oldest of myths, namely, of gods giving laws to humans. In Red Harvest, a detective known as the Continental Op is the law, and much like Gods of old, he punishes those who transgress.The Continental Op has been summoned to Personville (also known as Poisonville to those in the know) but when he gets there his client has been murdered. His client's father, a local business bigwig named Elihu Willsson, hires him to clean up the town. You see, to prevent unionization of his companies, he called in all sorts of criminal elements to brutally supress them, whether through hook or crook, or just plain murder. But after doing their job, Elihu cannot just politely ask them to leave. So he offers the Op money to get rid of them any way he can. Out of a sense of outrage, justice, or just plain bloodlust, the Op accepts.This novel almost seems a horror novel to me. There's a lot of blood, lots of murder, and the characters are all creepy and grotesque. For example, one character is described as \\"a bow-legged man with a long jaw like a hog's\\". At one point in the bloodshed, the Op talks about \\"going out to feed\\" as though he is a vampire who feeds on violence. It reminds me of the demonic descriptions of Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. There's something very unsettling in Dashiell Hammett's books. Like H.P. Lovecraft's stories, you always sense some monster moving underneath the prose that might burn your eyes out if you saw it full on.Having said this, except for that feeling of disturbance, Hammett is not the great writer that he is cracked up to be. From the 3 works I have read of his, he's not that much better or worse than the typical contemporary crime writer. His characters seem pretty blank and empty but this actually helps out the stories which usually involve the most animalistic motives. It is an interesting experience to read his books, but I don't know if it's a rewarding or entertaining one. I guess if you want to feel unsettled, ill at ease, check his work out. If you like Red Harvest, there are two other books featuring the same character, The Continental Op, and The Dain Curse. In the end I am more impressed by this author's influence on American myth than the actual bones of his writing."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Possibly the best book of its genre ever written. If you enjoy detective novels or westerns, you need to buy this book."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"All those writers that flood the market these days, who cannot write a book of less than 500 pages and who think a &quot;violent&quot; story means also &quot;gross and gruesome;&quot; all those intellectuals that cannot see pith in dime novels, they should be locked up somewhere with this very slim book and not be released until they have learned some facts of literature.This is a gem of a book, from the unforgettable opening paragraph to the final &quot;he gave me merry hell,&quot; there is not one word, one comma or one period too many. Hammett can describe a character or a situation in five lines, the way a good painter may draw a human figure or an object with just five strokes of the pencil. The plot is tight, raw and yet elegant; however not to be recommended for people with short attention spans, because it has so many twists and turns, and more characters than a Russian novel. This only adds to the interest, though. I have read this book over and over and always find new things about it."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"If you find yourself wanting to read noir crime fiction, read the best--and this is the best (although Raymond Chandler fans might disagree). Hammett invented the \\"hard-boiled\\" detective, writing with a gritty style, witty and fast-paced dialogue, and picture-perfect character descriptions. His hero has a strong sense of right and wrong, but does not back away from letting the ends justify the means in cleaning things up.In this novel, the Continental Detective Agency operative (never named) is brought into town by the newspaper's publisher, who turns out to be dead by the time the operative arrives. Soon finding out that the town is \\"owned\\" by the dead man's father, the operative finagles a contract from the father to clean up the town, which has been taken over by four gang factions (and a crooked police force), who had originally been brought to town by the same father to break a labor strike. The plot from here on is very complicated, with the operative cleverly pitting gang against gang, leading them to all-out warfare. In the process, the body count mounts, but the operative escapes harm, through cunning and just blind luck.All this \\"red harvest\\" is almost too much for even the jaded operative, who says he is finding joy in the killing and is going \\"blood-simple.\\"The dialogue here is smart and stylish, the hero is appropriately jaded, and the plot is clever. Most of all, this dark world seems absolutely authentic and perhaps still exists, though in a more sophisticated and clandestine form; I would be willing to bet that criminals today are just as sordid and amoral as they were in 1929. And the people who oppose them still run the risk of going \\"blood-simple.\\""},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"When I first started reading this, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. However, with the writing style, intrigue, action, and jaw dropping moments, Red Harvest kept me on my toes. Personville (a fictionalized Butte, Montana) is corrupt to its eyeballs, making this little mountain town less than ideal. I am going to enjoy the rest of Mr. Hammet's novels, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Hammett at his best. I have just begun to read Hammett and this was a real delight to read. The Op is a great character."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest inspired a number of movies and is a classic story of one man versus an entire crooked town. It twists and turns like nobodies business! If you like hard boiled, if like noir, this is required reading."},{"Title":"What the Bible Really Says","review":"Bookstore shelves are full of Apologetic writings trying to prove stories in the Bible are literally true. If that's what you are looking for, get another book. What the Bible Really Says is thought-provoking, appealing to the intellect of the beliver. Yet the book is surprisingly readable.As we journey through the Old and New Testaments, Barthel digs through the controversial stories in the Bible and the similar myths in ancient religions without ever questioning the authority of the Scriptures. He constantly shows us that the Bible is more than a collection of Sunday school stories, but he never leads us to question our faith.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"What the Bible Really Says","review":"I am a layman who is interested in the study of the Bible. I am most interested in books about the Bible that are responsible and scholarly without preconceived ideals and theological agendas. I am not interested in books that make odd claims for shock value or that go out of their way to try and break new ground. This book delivered what I was looking for better than any other I have read so far.This book which was originally written in German and translated to English provides the layman with fascinating insights which are responsible and scholarly. One such example is the observation that many ancient traditions included written laws prior to the laws of Moses (designed to regulate the affairs of a society which usually involved denoting retaliation). What was unique about the laws of Moses (i.e., the Ten Commandments) was not only &quot;You Shall have no Other Gods before Me&quot; but &quot;You Shall Love Your Neighbor as Yourself&quot; which has no other precedent in the laws of ancient religions. You will also be treated to such wit and wisdom as &quot;... the first law of biblical criticism - speculation flourishes when facts are in short supply...&quot;If you are looking for commentary, this is not the book for you. You will be disappointed as the author only examines two of the five Books of Moses: Genesis and Exodus. He indicates that the other three books of Moses primarily concern sacrifices, statistics, and long lists of place names and then he moves on to the Book of Joshua and the Conquest of Canaan. This book is a reader meant for those who are interested in the highlights and fascinating insights about the Old and New Testaments that have been learned over the course of time."},{"Title":"What the Bible Really Says","review":"This is the first book I have read by Manfred Barthel. Barthel is an excellent example of the detail, thoroughness and thoughtfulness for which German writers are known.The English translation by Mark Howson, with additional material adapting it and providing context for English-language readers, is likewise superb. It sounds like an original writing in native English, not like the stodgy, unnatural and rough English we sometimes get of the German scholars.Barthel probes Bible content and related backgrounds and evaluates cultural updates from archaeology and other sciences that will shed light on biblical content. He does not seek just to simplistically prove that what the Bible says is true in an objective modern factual sense.His goal is rather to enter the world of the Bible, to develop a feel, and an appreciation for the text and the cultural and historical context it seems to represent. He reaches for the worldview behind what he reads there, attempting to see what would be meant in that original context, what styles of expression and what cultural format comes to light.He does an excellent job of critically evaluating findings of modern sciences, such as archaeology, new historical findings and textual studies to relate them to events, perspectives of personalities in the Bible. This is particularly fulfilling in regard to the Old Testament, which is rarely probed at the level of popular Bible study and pulpit theology.Few people seem to really know what the stories in the Bible really say, and less of an idea how they might fit together, or how you can make sense of two or three versions of the same story in Genesis or other parts of the Torah. I bought this book in 1985 on one of my trips to the United States form Kenya, when I gathered books on various subjects. I never got around to really reading this till 2003.It was an exhilarating experience, very satisfying as part of a three-year study of the Old Testament I planned for myself, supplemented with additional background studies in the New Testament, the Dead Seas Scrolls and related historical periods. I read the book leisurely, with critical reference to other sources over about a month's time in September and October 2003.Barthel provided some very stimulating discussions on various findings in archaeology that throws light on names and laces and events in the Bible. Anything in history and archaeology related to the Middle East and the Bible interests me.He goes through the Bible books in sequence and gives information from various sciences that help explain, clarify or verify each. There is more on the Old Testament, but also some related to the New Testament and a good section about the Essenes that gives some helpful insights.This was interesting and helpful because it brought to life the contemporary situation in these biblical events. I always like to study the Old Testament, particularly, to understand the stories, not just as history, but as real-life experiences of humans like me, in another culture and place.These people were trying to make sense of their challenges and insights in their own context and living situation, just as we do today, but with no benefit of all the centuries of gathered information we have access to!I try to get a personal sense of their encounters with the Divine in the events of their lives. It is a challenge further to try to understand the worldview they lived in and see how that helps clarify their understanding of the events reflected in what we now have recorded. Barthel did that."},{"Title":"What the Bible Really Says","review":"This has been one of my favorite books for nearly 20 years, and I credit it with igniting a burning intellectual curiosity that inspired me to write my own book on religion and the bible.While this book is BASED on Barthel's writing, don't overlook the fact that it was *adapted* for English-speaking cultures as well as translated from German by Mark Howson.Mr. Howson's breezy style and humor certainly make for easy and fun reading, but is frustratingly lacking in useable references, or in many cases even providing enough detail to perform a reasonable search should one wish to further pursue a particular subject.The process of publishing a book like this presents many opportunities for errors to creep in at several points - in the translation/adaptation, copywriters, editors, etc.Some of the most egregious errors in this book occur when discussing biblical Hebrew. For example - on page 18 we get off to a very bad start with, \\"...in the written form of verbs, there is no distinction between the past, present, and future tenses; the tense can only be deduced from the meaning of the entire sentence.\\" Actually, while biblical Hebrew has no formal tenses, it does have two temporal 'states' - perfect, referring to completed action (cf. Past tense), and imperfect, incomplete or continuing action (cf. Present and/or Future tense).It gets even sloppier with his following example - \\"So when a reader came across a word written 'KSR', he would simply have to decide for himself whether the three characters were intended to mean 'he breaks', 'he broke', or...\\".First of all, there are some 40 verbs in biblical Hebrew (and Aramaic) listed in the concordance that can be (and are in the AV) translated as 'break' - and 'KSR' is NOT one of them. KSR is, in fact, modern Arabic - which while a Semitic language, is in a completely different linguistic branch. That said, KSR (kasar) would unambiguously mean 'he broke' - all the other forms ('he breaks', 'you break' 'we break', etc.) would have additional letters added to the triliteral root as part of normal verb conjugation - Hebrew (and Arabic) is a highly inflected language.Then on page 122 we have the rather startling \\"...qaran, 'to be radiant, to shine', which when written without the vowel points is indistinguishable from qeren, 'to bear horns.'\\" This is unforgivable - as even a cursory glance at any Hebrew lexicon will quickly tell you, qeren is NOT a verb, but a noun directly related to 'qaran' that simply means 'horn(s)'. Moreover, 'qaran' appears in Psalm 69:31 - \\"This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that HATH [sprouts] HORNS [qaran] and hoofs.\\" Note that the use of 'qaran' here does not give the ox a radiant or shining countenance, but horns. There is a definite pattern here - 'halal' means 'to shine'; 'helel' means 'the shining one'. 'Habal' means to be or act vain; 'Hebel' means 'vapor, vanity'. Although qaran means 'to sprout/bear horns' and qeren means 'horn(s)', qeren can *figuratively* mean rays of light, as famously in Hab 3:4 - \\"And his brightness was as the light; he had horns [qeren] coming out of his hand...\\"On page 96, we have no less than two jarring cognitive dissonances. First, a reference of the use of alcohol as an ingredient in ancient Egyptian embalming fluid (distilling alcohol wasn't discovered/invented until the 7-8th century AD, well after the Egyptian mummification tradition had long ceased), and that tomatoes weren't cultivated in Egypt 'until Hellenistic and Roman times' (tomatoes are indigent to the New World, and were not even cultivated for food in Italy until the 19th century; certainly not in Egypt until the 20th!)Add the fact that there have been a lot of significant discoveries in the past 30 years since this was written, and one could make a very good case that a new revised edition is well overdue.It is probably a blessing, in a way, that this book is NOT presented in a scholarly manner, which can quickly become quite tedious.All in all, however, the book remains well worth the time and effort to leisurely peruse, or as a study guide, and is indispensible as a gentle introduction into - well, What the Bible Really Says."},{"Title":"What the Bible Really Says","review":"WHAT THE BIBLE REALLY SAYS has an accurate assessment on the Bible being a \\"best seller that no one reads.\\"\\"This curious state of affairs has inspired a whole series of new translations, all trying their best to make the venerable, familiar words of the Gospels keep pace with the 'living language.' This may not be the right way to go about it though; as new revisions and translations multiply, more and more questions are being raised about the linguistic accuracy of Scriptural verses that we have been familiar, if not always comfortable, with since childhood.\\" Page 12.Another interesting quote was on page 305 regarding Messiah's birth-\\"The traditional date of December 25 was fixed by Pope Liberius in the fourth century. The date was a shrewd choice, because the Romans celebrated the ancient pagan festival of the winter solstice on the same day, which allowed the pagan celebration of the unconquerable sun to be absorbed by the Christian celebration of the triumphant Son of God.\\"Mr. Barthel addressed some interesting Bible topics and offered some ideas on obscure items. Among them:-- A definition for \\"slime\\" used as mortar in Gen. 11:3.-- A corrected definition for the name Abraham.-- Identity of the \\"burning bush\\" seen by Moses.Some of the most pertinient information in this book in my opinion was the translational shortcomings of the King James Version.He demonstrates how a simple translational slip resulted in Moses having \\"two horns\\" in both the early latin Vulgate and the German Bible.He also dedicated some pages to explaining how the scribes approached the Sacred Name when they were transcribing texts.This book is outdated in one respect. As Mr.Barthel stated, the translation and publishing of the Dead Sea Scrolls was and continues to be, a work in progess. So there are more current books on that subject.Overall this book really falls somewhere between a 3 and 4 star rating in my opinion. Not a bad book."},{"Title":"What the Bible Really Says","review":"The author has done some great research and I like reading what he has said. Some of the things I already knew.

I also enjoyed how they explained some important events durinmg that period, and the relationships between white men and Indians.When there were fights, they described what happened very clearly, and drew an almost perfect picture in my head. Halfway through the story, an Indian comes to a man, and explains the Indian's entire point of view of white men, and told what they are doing to the land. I thought this was very clever of L'amour, and it was helpful for anyone reading it to further undertstand that time period. The battles made the book exciting, but some parts of it lacked interest and were too boring."},{"Title":"Westward the Tide","review":"Just one look at the beautiful and spirited Jacquine Coyle and Matt Bardoul knew that she was the woman for him. So when he finds out that she and her father and brother are planning to go on a wagon train, he decides to go along too. When he first learns about the wagon train heading for the rich pasture of the Big Horns and the gold which would be plentiful there, he finds nothing wrong. But soon he starts getting an uneasy feeling that something is definitely wrong. The wagon train would be made up of strong and innocent men and their families but they would be lead by a pack of the worst murderers, thieves, and gunslingers. Though Bardoul gets and urgently whispered message telling him not to go, he is still determined to go on the train because of Jacquine and the land at Big Horns. Bardoul doesn't realize that he is getting involved in a very deadly plot where the bad guys would stop at nothing to make sure everything goes according to their plans. Will Bardoul be able to figure out their plans before it's too late?I just love Louis L'Amour's westerns and &quot;Westward the Tide&quot; has got to be one of his bests ever! With plenty of intrigue, suspense, action, and romance, for any L'Amour fan this is a must read. One of the best things I like about this book are the characters which are portrayed. Characters like Matt Bardoul, Jacquine Coyle, Brian Coyle, Clive Massey, Buffalo Murphy, Logan Deane, Ban Hardy, Portugee Philips, and more, L'Amour wonderfully displays the different types of people who made up the American frontier.Other L'Amour books I highly recommend are: All of the Sackett books, including my most favorites, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot; and &quot;Galloway, &quot;North to the Rails&quot;, &quot;Broken Gun&quot;, &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot;, and &quot;Comstock Lode&quot;."},{"Title":"Westward the Tide","review":"Westward The Tide is perhaps one of the best books written by L'Amour, while reading this book, I found it really hard to put it down.

He instsed on looking at things his own way, and using TV's technology in ways no one else would even imagine.Today, whenever a business seminar leader trots out the well-worn cliche \\"thinking outside the box,\\" Ernie's face comes before me.And music was innate. So much of Ernie's TV tech stuff was 100% visual, it was tantamount to viewing a series of silent films.And we remember that silent movies had musical accompaniment. Ernie had to furnish music which would at once associate itself with the ruthlessly original visual imagery and also be, hopefully, something we'd not heard before.He scoured the globe for 1950s-era music that you'd never heard before. For example, even fifty years later, I cannot hear the version of \\"Jalousie\\" on this CD without seeing the \\"office equipment\\" visuals he made. And I'd be grateful for a plateful of fish.Ernie's outlook on things has warped me for life.

Very even handed dealing with opposing approaches towards the law &amp; gospel. You won't believe how much the law can figure into your life and how pleasing (not accepted), your soul can be before God."},{"Title":"Five Views on Law and Gospel","review":"Anyone interested in the various views on the Law and Gospel should definitely consult this book. Ever since the groundbreaking book by E. P. Sanders in the late 1970s the issue of the Law's role in the Christian life has exploded in biblical-theological circles. This book will give you five predominant evangelical views on the Law and Gospel. This review will give a concise evaluation of the five views.The first essay is by William VanGemeren and he expouses the standard Reformed perspective. His approach is very similar to Vos' redemptive-historical approach, and thus, many traditional Reformed people (especially those who are seeped in the WCF) will find some points of disagreement. However, in essential agreement with standard Reformed theology, VanGemeren argues that no person can be justified by the Law and that the Law (the moral aspect) is a rule for the regenerate. This essay was the weakest by far, since VanGemeren argued mostly using logic than exegesis.The second essay by Greg Bahnsen argues for the Reformed theonomic approach. I found Bahnsen using logic and \\"God's nature\\" a lot rather than exegesis to argue for his position. It is no surprise then that most Christians reject this view because it fails to take into account the redemptive-historical shift after the Cross. Also, those who do accept this position do so because of social-cultural-political distate of our secular world than biblical exegesis.The third essay is by Walter Kaiser. Though his essay is the shortest of all (only 22 pp.) he argues most effectively for the continuous position than VanGemeren and Bahnsen. Kaiser argues that the moral aspect of the Law continues to have relevance for the new covenant Christian for sanctification. For Kaiser the Law was a gift given by God because of His grace (not a legalistic enactment). However, doing the Law does not confer salvation, but is an expression of faith by the redeemed.The fourth essay is by Wayne Strickland. This is another weak essay and does not represent all dispensationalists (especially progressive dispensationalists). Strickland argues for a strict discontinuous view where the \\"law of Moses\\" is replaced with the \\"law of Christ\\" (his dispensational view comes out quite obviously in his essay). However, his argument that \\"telos\\" in Romans 10:4 means \\"termination\\" is quite well-argued and his exposition of Galatians 3:10-12 is very well presented too.The fifth essay is by Douglas Moo and advocates a \\"modified Lutheran\\" view. I found this to be the most convincing and well-written essay. Moo argues that the distinction between Law and Gospel is a \\"salvation-historical\\" issue. The Mosaic Law is abrogated because no person can obey ALL its requirements to inherit eternal life. Thus, Christ is the only possible way sinners can receive justification and salvation. However, believers are still bound to live with the moral requirements of the new covenant. Moo's exegesis is quite persuasive.Hopefully there will be an updated edition where a sixth position will be expoused: The \\"New Perspective\\" view (or the \\"Anti-Protestant\\" view). Perhaps someone who has gripes with the Reformation can contribute to that essay. Overall, though, this essay still does the job of presenting major evangelical views on the Law and Gospel accurately."},{"Title":"Five Views on Law and Gospel","review":"While this collaborative counterpoint effort has a number of negative aspects to it, I still found this book to be very helpful in assessing the relationship between the OT Mosaic law and the NT Gospel message.First, the positives. Five contributors are asked to provide their views on this question. Of the 5, I found Kaiser to be the most persuasive, followed by Bahnsen and then Moo. All of the contributors do a good job of sufficiently nuancing the issue to reveal the many points upon which scholars depart from each other. I felt that each scholar made a solid attempt to deal with the whole counsel of Scripture as it relates to this question, which is a definite plus since this is not a given. Given this, the reader might well conclude that each view presented has strengths and weaknesses in light of Scripture.I felt that Kaiser's main essay was the most persuasive, as well as his rebuttals to the other essays. I thought that Bahnsen, while regretably employing a rather harsh tone here that pervades many of his writings, was nonetheless accurate in many of his critiques of the other views. I also felt that Bahnsen did a very good job of arguing for a theonomic position that is widely rejected because of the discomfort such a position tends to create on our modern sensitivities. But in many ways, Bahnsen made a good case for this view. Both Kaiser and Bahnsen argued in favor of continuity between law and gospel and applicability of portions of the law on the believer today, although they disagreed with each other mainly over how much of the law is applicable today. Moo offered the antithetical approach, and while I don't agree with him, I thought his essay was well done, although not without its problems. Strickland offered the dispensational view, which I found unpersuasive and mostly incoherent. VanGemeren offered a continuity proposal that was not well written, nor were his critiques of the other views persuasive. In my view, his efforts here were the weakest of the five scholars.There are a number of negatives that need to be pointed out. First, the book often gets very technical, and while this will be profitable for a more advanced reader familiar with theological terms, the beginner may have some trouble with this because many non-common theological words which are heavily used throughout each essay go undefined. Second, the diversity of views is overstated here. Ostensibly, this book is supposed to present five different views on this question. But really, VanGemeren, Bahnsen, and Kaiser are very close to each other in arguing the continuity position and disagreeing only in the details, while Strickland and Moo are very close to each other in arguing for discontinuity. So the diversity in approaches is not as diverse as it might seem on the surface. Lastly, there were a number of typos, particularly in Moo's essay, that should have been caught in the editing process. This negative is quite minor though.Overall, this book is a helpful addition to the recent explosion of works that have been produced on the law and its relationship to the believer today. This book is rather lengthy (better than 400 pages), but there is a sufficient amount of meat here for the reader to chew on as a springboard for further study."},{"Title":"Five Views on Law and Gospel","review":"Not all the parties have weighed in on this subject. Especially my own confession, the Lutherans were not given a fair hearing. As one reviewer of the book said: &quot;The Lutheran insights regarding Law and Gospel are caricatured, sometimes distorted, often ignored, but never truly given a fair hearing.&quot;How can this be a fair and accurate representation, when the Lutheran position has this quick disclaimer &quot;modified Lutheran&quot; from a non-Lutheran? How can one then proceed to represent even a modified-Lutheran presentation and only cite Luther three times out of 129, and none from Walther? Three from Calvin?This is like a Lutheran dominated book which has all Lutheran authors, then letting a Lutheran present the Calvinist position, but with the disclaimer &quot;modifed Calvinist position.&quot;For the Lutheran view, see C.F.W. Walther's, Law and Gospel. For a faith body that majors in distinguishing and not intermingling law and gospel, this interaction would have been interesting. Unfortunately, this is an interesting but nonetheless impoverished view."},{"Title":"Five Views on Law and Gospel","review":"This debate in the Counterpoint Series, whilst informative as a look at how 'Law & Gospel' can be viewed through various theological grids, lacks greatly in the area of historical and sociological analysis.The book opens with three authors arguing for basic continuity between Law and Gospel : Willem A. VanGemeren starts with a Reformed perspective which emphasizes that the Law is the \`perfection of righteousness in Jesus Christ'. He precedes Greg L. Bahnsen who advocates the minority-held Theonomic view i.e. OT civil laws (especially the penal sanctions) are timeless and absolute and therefore should be enforced by the government. Walter C. Kaiser Jr., undoubtedly the biggest fish in the pond, then teaches that it is the \`weightier' moral matters of the Law which the post-OT Christian must obey (a'la Matthew 23:23).The final two essays uphold that the relation between Law and Gospel is generally one of discontinuity and antithesis: Wayne G. Strickland (who is also the editor) presents a Dispensational view i.e. the OT Law was meant as a rule of life for Israel and is no longer binding on the church saint. Douglas J. Moo wraps up with a modified Lutheran approach which states that given the salvation-historical framework the Mosaic Law, being tied to the Sinaitic covenant, has been completely abrogated in Christ.Taking a cue from Kaiser's very systematic responses, here's a listing of the issues over which the battle ensued:a) Does the Mosaic Law put forth a hypothetical offer of salvation?b) Is the Mosaic Law a unified whole which disallows any distinction between its ceremonial, legal moral/ethical aspects? Can the moral elements remain without the ceremonial ones?c) Is Christ the \`end' or the \`goal' of the Mosaic Law? What about the Law & Prophets did Jesus say He came to fulfil, and which commandments did He warn everyone against breaking the least of (Matthew 5:17-20)?d) Was Paul's charge against the Jews for their continued allegiance to the Law or for their misuse of it (i.e. their legalistic righteousness)? Does the \`law of righteousness' in Rom 9:31 refer to the Mosaic Law or not?As mentioned earlier, my biggest complaint is the total absence of interaction with the work of E.P. Sanders and the issues prevalent in Second-Temple Judaism. There is no discussion about Paul's criticism of the 'works of the law' as possibly representing an ethnocentric barrier to inclusion into the people of God; as a Jewish denial of equality to Gentiles as co-participants in the eschatalogical age of God.A far more interesting book (especially given the present theological climate), IMO, should contain dialogues with the works of Dunn, Wright, Stendahl, Nanos (but his contribution only appeared in '97, a few years after this book came out), Raisanen, Schreiner, Westerholm, Thielman and, of course, Sanders.To be fair, Kaiser et al take into account the entirety of Scripture and their efforts are aimed at producing big 'systematic theology' pictures on how Law relates to Gospel, whereas the 'Paul & the Law' authors work almost exclusively with the Pauline epistles and Acts.Nevertheless, although this book should still be a worthwhile read, that there was no mention of Sanders at all makes the authors, IMO, a bit less credible than they could be."},{"Title":"Five Views on Law and Gospel","review":"This book strikes at the heart of the continuity/discontinuity debate that still surges throughout evangelicalism today, because ones' decision on this issue is the key to the entire issue in the mind of this reviewer. Overall, I found the book a much needed book as non-evangelical positions in regard to the Law and Gospel are being formed and propounded heavily now. The occasion seems proper now for an understanding of the evangelical positions on the issue.In the book, five overarching views are presented and then debated. The five positions are: a Non-Theonomic Reformed View (VanGemeren), a Theonomic Reformed View (Bahnsen), Kaiser's View (which is, in essence, a repackaging of VanGemeren's view), a Dispensational View (Strickland), and a Modified Lutheran View (Moo). In this first point in regard to the work seems to be the greatest weakness of the book. Although 5 views are presented, really only two major viewpoints are being espoused (viz., continuity (VanGemeren, Bhansen, and Kaiser) and discontinuity (Strickland and Moo). This is not a substantial problem, but it seems that within the two categories, only slight variations exist. For example, within the continuity side of the spectrum, Bahnsen adds application of the Civil Law and Kaiser subtracts the Covenant of Works. No real earth-shattering differences seem to this reviewer to exist between the three views besides these points. On the discontinuity side of the spectrum, the differences seem less clear. On some levels, Moo seems to attempt to differentiate himself from Strickland, but on the whole seems to promote a theology that identifies with the dispensational model (with only nuanced differences). The display of the flavors of the positions in the book was helpful, but, to some degree, the debate seemed to only swirl around either the nuanced differences (by those on the same side of the spectrum) or the broader implications of their continuity/discontinuity decision (by those on the opposite side of the spectrum).All of the writers were knowledgeable of their topics and wrote quite well, and the debate was also well done. Overall perception of the writers is as follows:VanGemeren presents more of a Systematic approach rather than Dogmatic. He is criticized by his colleagues on this. Although such an approach is to be commended it did not fit well in this work. He should have focused more on laying our a defense for his system of theology rather than trying to give a comprehensive outline for the doctrine.Bahnsen seems very assertive. Overall his approach adds life to the debates as he fires strong attacks against his colleagues' positions (e.g., the accusation of VanGemeren \\"gerrymandering the historical evidence\\"). His position seems to be helpful, but overall it seems to be a slightly less potent position on civil law than some of his Theonomic brothers (as is also stated by the other writers in the work).Kaiser is ever the OT theologian's theologian. His writing brings much to the book, but, unfortunately, gets lost in the mix. The reader will struggle to discern clear differences between Kaiser's position and the Non-Theonomic view. In reality, only nuances seem to exist, with the only major exception of Kaiser's implicit denial of the Covenant of Works. This reality is driven home by the titling of Kaiser's position (\\"The Law as God's Gracious Guidance for the Promotion of Holiness\\"). The description of the position is practically useless as all 4 other views would agree with the statement. Kaiser's position needs to be set up much better if it is to speak clearer to the reader.Strickland presents an adequate perspective on the dispensational view. It would seem that his perspective is more progressive and allows more flexibility as he interacts with the Reformed perspectives. The positions and arguments were well-written, but still simply returned to the ongoing continuity/discontinuity debate. Strickland is unable to provide definitive proof for his position.Moo presents a fascinating Lutheran/dispensational view. The position he takes is of interest because it has historical roots and approaches the issue from the standpoint of discontinuity (rare outside the dispensation camp). Although he seems to chase gnats to differentiate himself from dispensationalists, he adds much to the depth of the book by reviving another tradition within evangelicalism. It did seem that Moo was overly defensive as he oft proclaims \\"I am no Marcionite.\\" The defense should have been unnecessary given an appropriate presentation of his position.Overall, the pros and cons with each writer balance out and a helpful debate on the critical subject emerges. Thus far the major critique that other reviewers have brought up has been that the view does not include the \\"New Perspective\\" on the Law and Gospel; however, this does not seem to be a substantial problem for this reviewer. The new views on the Law and Gospel call for a fresh articulation of the mainstream evangelical view(s) of the Law and Gospel. Only then can comparisons and contrasts be drawn. Further, such a position would skew the entire framework of the debate. In other words, the current work is really a debate over the continuity and discontinuity of soteriology between the OT and NT, whereas the the New Perspective focuses more on the sociology between the OT and NT. For these reasons, the addition of the New Perspective would not have been as helpful in the mind of this reviewer.If a reader is seeking a broader understanding of the continuity/discontinuity debate, or the differences of writers even on their own side of the spectrum, this book is an excellent read. If a reader is looking for a deeper understanding of the spectrum of established evangelical positions on the Law and Gospel, this is a work well worth picking up. If the reader is looking for a work that is directed towards the New Perspective position, then this book is not that book. Much is presented in the work, but much more remains to be done."},{"Title":"Five Views on Law and Gospel","review":"This is a tough read. It was a required text for a pentateuch class.

I got so much out of that volume, that I decided to purchase the entire set to study and keep for reference. My spiritual growth has been remarkable as a result. Seminary students and professionals would probably enjoy this series, which seems geared for them. But this series is also excellent for those college-educated laypeople who feel inclined to enhance their understanding of Christian theology. That is, with one caveat: Buy a decent theological dictionary to refer to at first. It probably won't get used much after about the third book you choose to read, but initially you will be need it to be confident of some of the terms used among advanced theologians. Then, the Counterpoint series will give you a full understanding of many different concepts and concerns of the Christian faith which have been applicable from early on until the present.

So many math concepts are taught using nonfiction so children can understand the connection easier.

Unfortunately, the area has been severely altered after 3 big fires (one of which was the biggest in Colorado history). Some of the roads that access these areas are closed, and some other rocks featured in this book are privately owned, and now off limits. That makes this book more valuable. Part of its value is its scarcity - I don't know how many were printed, but I'm sure it isn't many. It is a book bound with ring-clips and carboard stock. It will likely only be of interest to those people who either climb or have climbed in the region, but it does provide some interesting insight into the area before the age of the beautiful guidebooks we have nowadays. Interestingly, there are routes and rocks featured in this early print that are NOT featured in the 88 or 97 printing. Climbing book junkies like myself will prize owning this."},{"Title":"Behavior Modification--What It Is and How to Do It (6th Edition)","review":"I used this book as a special education undergraduate.

It is full of common, everyday examples in order to help one transition from the theoretical to the concrete."},{"Title":"Behavior Modification--What It Is and How to Do It (6th Edition)","review":"There is a ton of usable information in this book. The problem is getting past the jargon and text book manner in which it is written. It really is more for university students than the lay person. Keep in mind that it is a text book for 2 consecutive psychology semesters. So, if the answers do not jump out at you, then do not get frustrated. I have read it through a few times and still do not grasp some of it. If you have the patience to apply something as simple as the operant conditioning, you can actually make a habit within a month. For instance, I used to reward myself with 15 minutes of fiction reading for every chapter of biology that I read. Result? I went from a D to a B within a couple of months. I have helped some of my clients do the same procedure with quitting smoking and sticking with fitness plans.

It literally traces the history of behavioral modification from its origins and progresses into actual techniques that can be used in a variety of setting. Some of the chapters are quite dense, yet interesting. There is a comprehensive summary and the authors do a wonderful job with breaking down large units of information into readable points. There is a useful guide for functional analysis provided. The behavior contract is generic, but a decent basis for a individualized one.

You cannot go wrong with this book. The fact that this book is in it's 8th edition and is used by many college programs speaks to it's strengths. I did read the one dissenting review where it lowered someone's GPA because they did not understand or test well on the material. ABA is deceptive. While it is the just the science of good learning there is a lot of skill and aptitude needed. Being a member of T.O.P.S., Intertel, Mensa, the International High IQ society to name a few I can see that this is not for everyone. Some people are good at being students, some people are good at understanding and implementing good science; with ABA you need to be in the latter group.

This book is very useful because it pairs technical concepts to many life situations as examples to make it more tangible for the reader. I am now pursuing a graduate degree and I still find this manual useful to reference. This is a wonderful book for an academic setting however I think it is as equally appropriate for the layperson looking to understand the in's and out's of Behavior Modification (i.e. parents of a child with Autism).

If you are in an undergraduate psychology program--BUY THIS BOOK. If you are a parent of young children/teens or future parent-- BUY THIS BOOK. If you are interested in improving your life (e.g. weight loss or any other kind of behavior change for self-improvement)-- BUY THIS BOOK.My point is--this book is very informative. The authors describe the pros and cons of the various types of reinforcemet as well as descriptions of plans and which work best in certain situations.And if you're considering an older edition (I had the 5th or 6th edition from my undergrad years), buy the 9th edition instead. I thought it was like a new book. The older ones are good but this was far better. It can be pricey but the international copy is about half the price (and is exactly the same besides the difference in British spelling).

Although it does a fantastic job of breaking everything down to the simplest factor (sometimes too simple for someone with a lot of experience working with kids or anyone who's taken 2 or more psychology classes) I personally can't seem to read more than 2 pages at a time. There are way too many reference points in the middle of sentences and paragraphs everywhere. Instead of standard notations to see credited authors or developers at the end of a section, bottom of a page (in fine print) or elsewhere in the book (together), it sites each and every source after the sentences that talk about it in the text itself. Some pages have citations every 2 or 3 sentences. It is very difficult to focus on the points or the text when you keep getting notes in the middle.

However, she is very careful to make sure her speculation coincides with facts that are unexplainable otherwise.I am a fairly good student of Eleanor and Henry II and there is not much doubt that the very popular books on Eleanor pretty much enhance her life beyond what really occurred. This does not stop me from enjoying a good historical novel about either of them. In this case, the speculation about the Empress Maude and King Stephen is probably fantasy, but Jones does a credible job of making sure that all the wild events fit into the known historical facts. In fact, she is the only novelist I have yet read who came up with a plot that actually explained the bizarre swings of fortune that occurred during the long civil war between Maude and Stephen. She keeps a very positive narration on both sides (something that so many novelists just can't seem to pull off - most just *have* to demonize one party or the other). She has decent explanations for Maude's actions in London as well as Stephen's crazy releases of both Maude and the adolescent Henry as well as his final act of making Maude's son his heir instead of his own son Eustace.When history is insane (and it certainly was during this period), I can find enjoyment in a crazy plot designed to explain the insanity. ..."},{"Title":"The Fatal Crown","review":"Very well written and fast paced. 500+ pages that just disappeared--I didn't want it to end. Wonderfully drawn characters that you come to know and care about. Action, adventure, history and some very good sex. Jones does play a bit fast and loose with the history--but after all it is ficiton and the book is so good that it really doesn't seem to matter. While suggesting that Henry II might actually not be a Plantagenant (did I spell that correctly?), might send some to screaming--Jones is not the first author (in fiction or non-fiction) to make reference to an attraction and admiration existing between royal rivals Maud and Stephen. Even the beloved Sharon Kay Penman makes some reference to this in &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept.&quot; Anyway, Jones does get most of the rest of the history right and I always find it enjoying to read anything about Stephen of Blois and Maud, especially books that paint Maud in a favorable light. It seems to me she was unfairly manipulated to the extreme throughout her life and then abused by the historians as well. As historical romance goes, this is one of the best I've read. I can't wait to read the sequel."},{"Title":"The Fatal Crown","review":"I found this book extremely enjoyable and a quick read. The romance part I did not enjoy much but it was essential to the events in the book. It was well written which made the descriptions that much more interesting. And the time period was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Fatal Crown","review":"It has been over a year since I read this book. The reason I pulled up Amazon today was to look for the promised sequel. As someone who enjoys both European history and romance novels, and who has passing familiarity with the real stories of the characters in this novel, it proved a deeply satisfying blend of fact and fiction. I will go so far as to say that this title started me reading Regency romances...of which I've now read about thirty. (Yes, I realize The Fatal Crown does not take place in the Regency period; rather, it is set in the century following William the Conquerer.)Another reviewer implied that it is more of a \\"romance\\" than a literary novel. Does that make it lack prestige, in his opinion? If he's right - and I'm not sure that everyone would agree with him - labeling it a romance doesn't bother me one bit. Romances happen to own a huge share of the book market!Ms. Jones, please hurry up with that sequel!"},{"Title":"The Fatal Crown","review":"The political alliances formed in the aftermath of the conquest of England in 1066 had repercussions for generations and the rulers in twelfth century Europe are depicted as a scheming combination of political aspiration and ruthless ambition. Caught in the middle are two royal heirs to the English crown, whose supporters will bring England to civil war in the fight for supremacy.In A Fatal Crown, Ellen Jones has woven the historically accurate story of the fight for power between Maud, daughter of King Henry I, and her cousin Stephen of Blois, and has created a story of illicit passion, and royal subterfuge. I am not sure that there is any historical evidence to suggest that Maud and Stephen ever embarked on an illicit love affair, and yet within the context of this story it works well and ultimately offers a more romantic version of what after all was a supreme power struggle.If you are upset by slight variations in history then this book is not for you, but if you want a lively historical romp with a smattering of sex and romance then you won't be disappointed.Originally published in 1991, the book is now republished with new and more appealing cover art. It continues to be a fascinating and sensuous account of this troubled period in English history."},{"Title":"The Fatal Crown","review":"The idea that this book presents, that Maud, the Holy Roman Empress and erstwhile Queen of England, and her cousin Stephen of Blois, who usurped her throne, had a passionate affair that resulted in the birth of Henry II, is probably ludicrous - but it makes a great plot! In fact, if your only exposure to this time period is \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" by Follett, pick this book up. It is undeniably more \\"romantic,\\" but offers clever explanations for some of the odd events of the civil war that ushered in the Plantagenet monarchy, arguably among the most colorful families to rule England.I have read this book twice, and re-reading does not diminish its quality. If you find it, keep it - you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Fatal Crown","review":"I have read that this book was historically inaccurate-it was still a good book.

Ellen James takes a defining moment in English history--the struggle between Maude of Germany and Stephen of Blois for the English throne--and turns it into a love story, even implying that Maude's son Henry was fathered by Stephen and not her husband Geoffrey of Anjou!

As the author notes in the introduction, the reason for the book was to bring to the fore the fact that medical school was an educatiional process of learning to heal and not a technical training institute. This initial phase is critical for it must last a lifetime.The fourteen chapters, some of which are previous articles, move from early days to the present. He comments and describes the education scene in early America, the role of the German system, the birth of modern academic medicine and its associated teaching hospital and some assorted ones on finance, state laws, and organized medicine.The writting is relaxed and clear allowing the book to be read with pleasure and value. The facts are clearly presented in support of his story of the developement of American medical education, warts and all.

I give it to lots of people and they love this book.I live in a very wealthy community and frequently see what happens when parents over-indulge their children. Many times these kids grow up and can't finish college; or even worse, they get involved with drugs. They are totally un-motivated and quite often unable to focus on a jobWhat I particularly like about How Much is Enough? is that it gives information not just on how to avoid financially indulging your children, but also on how to emotionally indulge your children. Often the problem is two-sided. It's not that the child has been given too many things; it's also that they have way too much freedom or no rules at all. The author has made it easy for the reader to focus in on the particular issues that they find challenging.The examples are compelling and easy to understand. Aunts, uncles and grandparents can learn a lot from this book, too. The sooner you \\"get it\\" about what is happening in the lives of your children and grandchildren, the better off you are. The author also gives you insight into your own issues, where perhaps you were over- or under-indulged, and how you carry that over to your children.Because I was so interested in the subject, I did not find this book difficult to read--nor did any of my clients.

We could say this book speaks about materialism in the family, economy, and resource allocation. But the sterling core of this book is about conscience. The authors, in every chapter, in graphic examples, ask the question: \\"Is anyone being hurt by each decision and action we personally make?\\"We live in a time where our culture does not speak out about the value of conscience. We have overfilled jails and juvenile facilities, overactive pharmaceutical industries and financial institutions, but where do we hear about the value of knowing and doing what is right? Has this become an unpopular notion?These authors give us guidelines to be able to judge for ourselves where the lines are between what is enough, and what is overindulgence. This book illustrates through narrative examples what happens, what the effects are, when this line is crossed over. In a time when consumerism is encouraged and having more is considered better, these authors cause us to ask ourselves if we even know how much is enough. Their research shows us the consequences: to individuals, to families, and to our culture when the concept of enough becomes cloudy.Using a very clear test of four questions, the authors teach us to have means to judge our interactions with others in our lives. While speaking specifically about interactions between children and their responsible caregivers, the book puts us in the detective's seat to be able to see how a given situation could be interpreted as either helpful or harmful, and how to discern the difference.When helping can seem like hurting, and hurting can seem like helping, how exactly are we to be able to know what is really occurring? This book gives us the tools and skills to clearly see which path to take. It presents a calculus of human behavior, with if ... then equations that describe the actual content of interactions in a way we can quantitively define the correct outcome.While being readable, interesting, and enjoyable, this book transforms us. After reading How Much is Enough, no one can proceed without having a different view of personal economy. We are challenged to look at ourselves, our decisions, our acts, and consider if anyone is being hurt before we proceed. This book gives us a tangible grip on conscience and how to use it in everyday ways.Myra Fourwinds, M.A."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"I disagree with \\"Concerned Consumer\\" (who gave this a 1 star rating). I am a Marriage and Family Therapist, have worked with children and adolescents for over 20 years, and could not disagree more with this persons review. There are very few books that I believe so succinctly address the problem of overindulgence in today's children and adolescents (even adulthood). In today's consumer, materialistic, automated society we absolutely need a book that addresses this problem and breaks it down in a way where a parent can identify clearly what areas they may need to work on and improve. This book does just that. I find it very informative and researched based, as it is clearly not a simplistic issue. I love the appendices to address what to to expect and what to focus on in each developmental stage as well as the helpful assessment. There is always a nay sayer and it usually is someone who does not want to admit that they might benefit from such a book. If you are drawn to attachment parenting, this book is also for you, as it clearly defines what is a healthy approach versus an unhealthy approach to attachment parenting (which is really that the parent is trying to meet their needs rather than the childs).The book breaks down 3 types of overindulgence: \\"Too much\\" , \\"soft structure\\", and \\"over nurturing\\". There is an assessment in the Appendices to find out which area might need more focus. The researchers also ask 4 questions in each scenario to determine if your child is being overindulged in various situations, or overall. I think these four questions are important for anyone to find that fine line between loving your child wholly, and loving them but not allowing them to grow into a healthy, strong, and independent adult. I personally have a 5 year old and a 2 year old and this book helped me understand why although my son is well behaved and very sweet; there are areas that I can see I need to work on to help my son be more appreciative and less dependent on me for \\"entertaining\\" him. Very helpful to me personally, and to the parents I have encouraged to read this book.My ONLY complaint is that I wish this book were offered on Kindle!!! So, I hope the publishers consider making this a Kindle book in the future!Highly recommend."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"I loved this book!

I think it's structured really well, very thorough, very helpful in understanding some of the pitfalls of parenting and some of the ways to be more effective. There are a lot of examples, which can slow down the reading but also help understand better what the author intended. Some of what the book says is very common sense and would seem obvious and like nothing new, but the way the author puts out the information is somehow very fresh and helped me understand better what behavior to avoid.

Of special utility is the advice on what to do when friends or family (especially doting grandparents!) overindulge the children. There's even counseling on how to break a generational cycle when the parent was overindulged as a child."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"I gave a copy of How Much Is Enough?, by Jean Illsley Clarke, et al., to a friend who is a grandfather many times over.

Nevertheless, it is a good read and encourages parents on their way to raise kids without overindulgence."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"I am a social worker, and I find this book to be pathetic. The authors style is written for unintelligent people who know nothing about parenting. It is important to set clear boundaries and limits for your children, while providing the right amount of nurturing. If you feel you need a book on setting limits, this is NOT the book for you...It does talk about effects of \\"overindulgence\\" but you can have the same results from any lack of parenting skills, abuse, etc. Find a better book to help you with proper limit setting."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"The authors present a wealth of great information on how to avoid overindulging children (and they are very careful to explain how overindulgence is different than spoiling). The central overindulgence theme is explored through various topics such as \\"too many things\\", \\"too much freedom\\" or \\"too few rules\\", just to name a few. These subtopics make it easy to zero in on precise concerns, if necessary, but the text is still an easy and productive read from cover to cover.The problem comes from trying to locate information specific to, say, dealing with toddlers or teens (there are even some strategies presented for dealing with adult children). Because the subtopics are presented as wholes, with information specific to various age groups mixed together, it may be difficult for a parent who needs information on a specific topic for a specific age group to find what he or she needs most. Parents are almost compelled to read through pages and pages of non-applicable information that they don't need, just to stumble across that which they do.Particularly appreciated are the portions of the text dedicated to quoting adults who were overindulged as children. Reading about the difficulties they faced as a result of their upbringings will give extra support to parents struggling with making the transition to supporting parenting from overindulgent parenting.Parents who have the time and willingness to read through the entire text in order to gain the overall picture of overindulgence and its many insidious forms will gain the most from the book. Parents facing an acute challenge requiring quick strategies and specific suggestions may wish to turn elsewhere."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"What is overindulgence? Many people think that overindulging their child means to spoil them, but in reality, overindulgence is much more complex. In the newly released book How Much Is Enough?, authors Jean Illsley Clarke, PH.D, Connie Dawson, PH.D, and David Bredehoft, PH.D, strive to show parents and other influential adults how to raise children who are considerate, responsible, and polite by teaching them all about overindulgence and how to avoid it. All three authors have done extensive research on the issue of overindulgence and this is not a first publication on the topic for any of them.How Much Is Enough? is an informational book, yet it cannot be described as a text book. One thing I really enjoyed about reading it is that not only does it present useful information and explain terms used; but it also presents us as readers with real life examples and stories so that we can apply the information and see where it might be useful. There are also many pictures and diagrams included so that we can visualize the most important points. Since we all learn best through different styles, the unique presentation of information is helpful. Also, a lot of the information is reiterated over again throughout the book so that we can fully understand what is being offered to us.Humor is evident in How Much Is Enough? which makes the book much more enjoyable, easy to read, and easy to understand. Whether the reader is a parent, plans on being a parent someday, or works with children in any way, overindulgence is an issue that needs to be faced. This book truly addresses every issue on overindulgence and teaches readers everything they would ever want to know about the topic. I would recommend this book to everyone over the age of fourteen."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"My first impulse is to say \\"yes\\" to my kids when they ask. I thought that was part of what being a parent was about. I want them to have fun, I want them to be happy, but I also want them to be functional, competent adults. This book gives me the information I need to be able to say \\"no\\" and have it stick, to establish boundaries, lay out expectations, and reward appropriate behaviors. Now I know that doing so gives my children what they need, not simply what they want. I think all parents should have a copy of this book. It is so very useful, and written in a way that does not blame, but shares information."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"Jean Illsley Clarke's new book is remarkable! Using research from three research projects involving nearly 1,200 participants, she and her co-authors give concrete illustrations of overindulgent parenting and its unintended effects. It's hard to see my own behavior in some of the examples, but it's good to know that its never to late to make positive changes. How Much Is Enough includes excellent tools and practical advice to aid in the raising of \\"likeable, responsible and respectful children\\". I particularly like using the \\"Test of Four\\". I am so grateful that a book like this has come along. I am certain that using the materials in Clarke's How Much Is Enough will make a significant difference in my family's life now and in the future."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"I have found this book to be extremely practical in its application to everyday life, both as a parent and beginning-therapist. It provides readers simple ways to identify overindulgence and methods for avoiding or overcoming it. This is a must-have for parents who believe that children benefit from clear boundaries. WARNING: it may cause you to rethink your parenting style and increase self-awareness! :) More work from these authors on the subject matter is requested."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"Overindulgence may be the farthest thing from a child welfare social worker's mind when the subject of child maltreatment, child abuse, or child neglect comes under discussion. Overindulgence, while not a statutory category of child maltreatment, may provide a lens and language useful in multi-problem child welfare cases that enhances assessment and effective strengths-based communications with courts, advocates, therapists, and parents. Child welfare prioritizes goals of remaining together as a family with health, safety, and benefit to the children's growth and development, and frequently utilizes parent education as a primary opportunity for communication, assessment, and intervention.A recently released book by Clarke, Dawson, and Bredehoft (2004) presents research on overindulgence in a manner that adds potentially relevant concepts to child welfare work. Parent education and child welfare share concerns of balancing nurture, structure, and resources to prevent disruptions in children's development, health, and safety. Clarke, Dawson, and Bredehoft (2004) describe overindulgence as parenting that hinders children from accomplishing developmental tasks and prevents them from learning life skills. Whether extremes of abundance or deficits exist, a frame of reference for understanding how to strike a desired balance between excess and insufficiency may provide a vital missing piece in assessment and in empowering the healing process for families of all backgrounds. Using scientific research to identify adverse outcomes affecting children's lives, this new book on overindulgence includes presentation of assessment techniques and the necessary action steps to assist families in rebalancing their parenting."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch","review":"The basic informational examples were helpful. They showed how one can easily tip the scales in parenting and surprisingly be overindulging. They were able to support how an example was overindulging by following through on how the action would eventually negatively affect the child.However, there were also bold statements riddled throughout the book about how an act is bad parenting without any true supportive evidence. The writing style is hard to swallow. Whereas there are informational examples in the first part of the book showing how a particular parenting style is overindulgent, the preachy \\"be a better person than the rest of society\\" attitude is inhibiting to the message.[for those that have read the book - the \\"how to handle yourself when a child is acting up on an airplane\\" section didn't seem to flow with rest of the book. It seemed as if the authors had a personal issue. Besides, they never explain what age they are referring to. An 18 month old screaming or kicking or running up and down the aisles doesn't deserve strangers rudeness. How much reasoning are you going to do with an 18 month old?]Amazon will not allow me to change my rating. I made the mistake of reviewing the item prior to finishing the book. Because the first part of the book is where some of the questionable statements are made I was initially put-off. However, deeper into the book is more useful information provided with straighforward, non-judgmental viewpoints.

I haven't read about outwitting squirrels, neighbors, deer, mice and other critters, but if the attitude and approach is the same as in this book....Any building process, especially a renovation project, relies on fully developed plans, drawings and a well informed owner. This point is glossed over in this book. Oh! You might want to use an architect or designer for big projects like the pyramids, but you really don't need one for small things, like kitchen/bath renovations or room additions... Wait for your builder to do something and then decide that it should/could have been done differently..Well, you do need a design professional. If you don't know what you want - or even if you do, but don't have it documented relying instead on a contractor's clairvoyance and your own eloquence - you are going to be disappointed in the final product....The real point of this book - although never well expressed - is that it is of the first importance to work with reputable people. A tradesman whose office is in his hip pocket is likely not going to have the resources to do anything more than basic handiman work.It IS a funny book - unless you want to get your project done."},{"Title":"Outwitting Contractors: The Complete Guide to Surviving Your Home or Apartment Renovation","review":"This book provides crucial information about working with contractors in your home.

Ha ha I said, ready for a funny book about contractors.Seriously! If you're (a) hiring work on your home (especially remodeling) or (b) a remodeling contractor, you should read this book. Despite the jokes (some of them are even funny), Adler actually writes clearly and intelligently about his subject, in impressive detail. This is one of the top five books I've read about the customer-contractor relationship. Adler also includes many anecdotes that are as enlightening as they are entertaining.

He writes with the same charm and splendor that he uses in his paintings. For those of you who love his paintings the rest of this rewview is for you, for you will love this book!! Yes it is charming and romantic and ok, a little predictable. But that's ok. Enter the Beautiful little world of Cape Light where you are surrounded by good people, beautiful scenery, and characters like Sam Morgan, that you just can't help falling in love with. You know tall muscular, and extremly handsome and lets not forget the nicest guy to ever exist in fiction. Some will call this book sappy, but if you are like me living in world full of disappointments, and relationships that NEVER EVER work out. With dishonest guys at every turn.

The characters are alive and interactive. I have enjoyed each book in the series and look forward to more.His books describe this little town and the people who live there as well as his paintings describe the cottages and the seashores, all with the wonderful light."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I first heard about this book, recommended on QVC. Of course, Thomas Kincaid's name is what attracted me. Sure, we all know he is one of the best painters of modern times, so I was very curious to see if his writing could prove as pretty as his idyllic paintings. Well! I was not only *not* disappointed, but thoroughly sated by this book. It slaked in me a deep thirst to know more about the fascinating mind of Thomas Kincaid. Who better than the Master of Light, with his outstanding success--proving his intuition for the Real America, a better America--to reveal this \\"simpler life\\" and its pleasures? \\"The most collected living artist\\" is destined to be a success in more than one medium. Life is short, and it's far better and pleasant to spend some precious hours reading Thomas Kincade's moving visions than wasting time on tedious and outdated 'classics' like Tolstoy, Dickens, and Hemingway, who, unlike Kincade, pollute their 'art' with vulgarity. Thomas Kincade is surely not just the Painter of Light, but a true Master of Light. Thanks to Katherine Spencer and Thomas Kincaid for teaming up and, like the Cape Light lighthouse, casting forth this beacon of light. So simple, so pretty! Read it, and you, too, will feel simpler."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I am so glad that I have found this lovely series of books! It is so refreshing to read some great fiction without tons of sex, violence and/or language filling the pages. These are gripping characters who keep the story alive without resorting to all of the 'junk' that a lot of today's authors turn to. I would not be concerned one bit if my small children read this book - it's just a good wholesome read with a little bit of God and faith thrown in (without shoving the Gospel down your throat)."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book. It gives you hope. It was so wonderful I have read every other Cape Light novel by Thomas Kinkade and katherine Spencer. I am anxiously awaiting the new on that comes out in October of 2006."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"Thomas Kinkade, the famous painter, changes genres as he writes his first novel with Katherine Spencer. This is the story of a small New England town where Jessica Warwick has returned to care for her mother, who is a stroke victim. Jessica's mother, Lillian, was one the social leader in this small town, but a scandal involving Jessica's father has reduced Lillian to a bitter, complaining old woman. Her snobbery intact, Lillian disapproves of her daughter dating Sam who is a local carpenter and handyman. Years earlier, she had disapproved of her other daughter Emily's marriage to a man whom Lillian considered to be her social inferior. Emily's husband died and she returned to Cape Light with an uncomfortable secret. Jessica fights her own social prejudices and resisists Sam's efforts to build a closer relationship with him. This book is similar to those of the Mitford series, but the authors do not have Jan Karon's ability to sketch characters and make them instantly likeable. There are many loose ends left in the lives of the townspeople, obviously leaving the door wide open for a continuing series. This is a pleasant read, but not a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"When this novel came to our local library, I checked it out mostly out of curiosity. I was surprised how good the story was, disappointed our library had not yet received any of the others Kinkade has written. So I checked on Amazon.com and decided to order the first four in hardback. It's the kind of series you like to own, maybe pass on to relatives as you finish reading them. You want to hurry to the next one to follow each character.Although Thomas Kinkade is known as the Painter of Light, his novels are great, too!"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I loved the book, in fact, I've loved each book of the series so far. I like \\"meeting\\" the new people and finding out how their lives are going to change the regular characters. It is great to read books from Christian authors who are using all the right words!"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"This is a book that is VERY hard to put down! I also did NOT see Cape Light as a Bible-thumping town; the pastor is a kind, warm, non-judgmental man who has problems just like members of his congregation do. Reverend Ben's wife is sweet and caring; her battle with depression gives her more depth and makes her easier to relate to, as she is not really a main character in the book. Emily, the mayor of Cape Light, seems strong, capable, dedicated, patient, compassionate... almost like a too-perfect painting that has only one set meaning to it. Until we get to know her heart and thoughts and see that Emily has constructed a seemingly-perfect facade to mask her loneliness and regrets for the past. She doesn't realize that part of the past has come looking for her.Emily's sister, Jessica, doesn't expect to make Cape Light her home: it's just a temporary situation for her while she's helping her sister take care of their mother, almost 99% rotten Lillian. Again - Kinkade uses his paint strokes magically to reveal something sparkly light about this seemingly never happy, sour-faced woman that a stranger to the little town manages to view a peek of. But Jessica never planned to meet someone like Sam, who seems to have a hold on her heart from the very start, though she may not realize it in time... even when the answer seems to stare her in the face, it may be too late to make amends. There are many disasters/painful problems or just plain messes that occur in the book, and what Sam says in the middle of the first mess (he is putting in a window for Jessica in her office at work and there is plaster dust all over the place) seems to ring true through the whole book: It'll get worse before it gets better! That's not to say that the story line must go through any bad stages before it gets better - there is not a dull moment in Cape Light. But the pain the people who live there feel often reaches deeply before it withdraws: the problems these people face are not superficial, &quot;easy-answer&quot; challenges.There are so many more wonderful people for you to meet in Cape Light - don't worry about losing track of everyone; they're easy to get to know. There is always something happening and always something for which you just have to keep turning the pages to see what will happen next. I agree with other reviwers: I can't wait for Kinkade and Spencer's next book; Cape Light was an excellent place for me to vacation this weekend, I was reluctant to return to my living room... and I'm ready to go back to Cape Light already! I think the agony of waiting will get worse before it gets better!"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"Bought this after reading Kinkade's first book in another series that involves the community of Cape Light. This is the first of the Cape Light Series and Kinkade does a great job of introducing the characters and giving a good insite as to who they are as part of the community. I found it very intertaining and it kept my interest throughout the entire book. I have subsequently read book 2 and book 4 of this series and continue to enjoy the writing style of Kinkade and Spencer, his co-author of this series."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this book, from the setting in a small coastal town, to the memorable characters who live there. I was, however, surprised that at times the writing struck me as a bit mundane. Some descriptions were rather repetitive or unimaginative, and some of the things that the characters said almost made me roll my eyes and think, &quot; Oh, please! &quot;. I was also a bit disappointed that many issues were left unresolved, such as the fact that Sara never did tell her birth mother, whom she became friends with, who she really was. Obviously, this leaves the door open for the sequel, which I do intend to read. The people are interesting and mostly likable, and you want to get to know them better. But I would like to see the writing become a bit more original and imaginative. Still, this is a pretty good first effort, and I look forward to more from Kinkade and Spencer."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"This book was a very enjoyable reading book.

It was obviously written with the idea of sequels in mind - there were just too many unresolved issues at the end - all waiting for another book.

He should stick to his mediocre paintings.I was expecting something more along the lines of Jan Karon's Mitford books and this doesn't even come close but it will sell well because people like his paintings. That makes no sense but it's my opinion. If I choose to read the next book in the series, I'll take it out of the library and not waste my money on it.

People know each other and even greet one another as family and friends are important to the residents.Thirtyish Jessica Warwick takes a leave of absence from her Boston banking job to return to her hometown to help her older sister, the village mayor Emily, care for their mother, recovering from a stroke. Jessica is bored of the limited social life whose activities either centers on the church or the Clam Box diner. She cannot wait for her duty to end so she can rush back to the exciting big city and her developing romance with cultured Paul Copperfield. Meanwhile the Clam Box owner Charlie Bates decides to run against Emily in the upcoming mayoral election for he believes Emily is a poor leader. Surprising even to herself, sophisticated Jessica is attracted to Sam Morgan, a church attendee handyman. With all this engulfing the two siblings, Cape May remains a haven to most of the villagers.CAPE LIGHT is an inspirational tale that brazenly tries to persuade readers into wholesome living through Christian messages. The story line contains numerous subplots focused on the trials, tribulations, and inner beliefs and strengths of several residents (more than just described above). Though tending towards sugary melodrama with little action, readers will relish how each key protagonist deals with their personal problems through love, friendship, and the Lord.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"This book allowed me to visit someplace I would love to live. On the sea in the northeast. The story grows and becomes more interesting throughout the book. Another book must be in the horizon because there were many unanswered questions in the end. Hurry up I need to visit Cape Light soon. If you like Jan Karon you would love Cape Light.."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"...and you will find a picture of this book. We have been assaulted with Kincaid in every shopping mall in America and NOW he has a book? This is not even as good as his sycophantic paintings (which are really Hallmark cards on posterboard). I implore you to stop supporting this machine. It is robbing humanity of thought and reason. Besides, it is really poor writing."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"Kinkaid cracks the brittle shell of sanity with this novel, which reads like a cleansing fire.The mayor of a small seaside town, Emily runs her fiefdom like a sapphic Pol Pot, brandishing the gleaming skulls of her enemies on pikes on the town commons. She manages to sublimates her gargantuan libido by squashing any and all dissent from the simple minded town folk.This all changes when her sister comes to town with Hot Larry, her [] manboy dogsbody. Larry's barely sentinent yearnings threaten to unleash an unholy nihilist firestorm on the small town, snapping the lattice of Emily's intricate power structure, bringing the whole thing to the ground. A shattering read."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed Jan Karon's \\"Mitford\\" series, which I have read twice, I decided to read the Cape Light books by Kinkade. I have read the first three and probably will read the sequels, mainly because they are clean books if nothing else. Like Mr. Kinkade's paintings, which are very predictable, so are the characters and the plots in Cape Light. When I read Jan Karon's Mitford series, all of which I own, the characters evolved until I was able to visualize them in my mind--not so with these books. There is too much repetition of phrases, often on the same page, and too little character and plot development. So you're wondering why I stayed with these through the first three books---hey, it's November and it's cold and rainy. And I didn't buy them, I got them at the library."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book because I am a fan of Thomas Kinkade, and was intrigued. The start of the book is set at a town party, where we are introduced to many of the characters. I found this section to be a bit confusing, as the story jumps from person to person without always a smooth transition. I even put the book down once or twice, but once I got past the initial introductions, I found this book very delightful. It reminded me of a small NY town from my childhood. I can't wait to read the others."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I picked this book up out of curiosity and the need of something to read...I was delighted to find that I picked a winner.

My hopes rose as I read each page and I look forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.The only negative I saw were blatant editorial errors."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"This was really a pretty good book.

Nice to give the mind a rest sometimes."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"Cape Light is a WONDERFUL BOOK. It is one that once you get started you feel like you are part of the Cape Light community. You feel the plight of Jessica and Sam. Emily, Lillian, Sarah, Charlie, and all the rest of the CL folks feel like your neighbors. You can't wait to pick up the next in the series. Thomas Kinkade and Katherine Spencer did a wonderful job with this series. The reader won't be disappointed. It is a book that you can sit back and relax and float away to the quaint little town of Cape Light."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I don't know where Sarah from Denver got the idea that this book has ANYTHING to do with lesbianism!! It most certainly does not. It is about two sisters, one of whom is the mayor of their hometown, but she was widowed as a young mother. This book, in no way, implies that she's a lesbian. If you have any doubts, read the following two books in the series. I seriously doubt if Thomas Kinkade, a devout Christian, would write a novel that has anything to do with homosexuality, which the Bible says is an &quot;abomination to God&quot;. Anyway, the book is enjoyable entertainment, and I found I wanted to read the sequels to find out what happens with the characters next."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed Cape Light. I can not wait for the next 2 books in this series. I want to find out more about this town and the people that live there. This book is charming,down to earth and just a wonderfully wholesome book. It draws you into the lives of the people. I read it in just a matter of days because I could not put the book down. I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. Some of the plot lines are predictable, some are not. I have read other &quot;professional&quot; reviews of this book and they call it bland and reading for people who can't take any excitement. I am just the average reader, but I strongly disagree. I feel it is well written and holds the readers attention all the way through until the end of the book. If you are looking for a good relaxing book to make you feel that the world can still be a better place, read Cape Light."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I found this to be refreshing story involving could-be real life people for whom life consisted of more than sex and money.The references to Christian values merely illustrate that Christianity is a way of life that meets the needs of real people. I found Jessica's problems with going back to a small town very valid and rejoiced with her when she learned what is most important in life. The mix of other characters who had various problems to face added intrigue to the story as you wonder how they will handle their situations."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I did not expect this book to be \\" the great American novel\\", however, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope another comes out soon, to follow this , because many threads were left hanging and I look forward to a sequel. I did not find this to be syrupy or Cape Light to be a Bible-thumping town as did Publisher's Weekly. It is a light novel about nice people in a New England town, with morals and closeness. Sometimes it is great to read something with no explicit sex or viloence or language as so many of the new books are today along with TV. If we had more down-to-earth novels, with good morals exhibited, maybe there would be less trouble in families."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book and the other two that follow. Kinkade is a wonderful painter and a good author. He's new at writing fiction and maybe started off with a few too many characters, but it became essential in knowing all of the people of the town. They will come back later. Knowing each of the stories of each of the secondary characters is so much more helpful in knowing why they are even in the story. He doesn't want you to just meet a few main characters. Kinkade wants to introduce you to an entire little village. The characters are so easy to relate with no matter your age. I am the same age as Sara but I can still relate to Emily and Jessica because he doesn't make them obviously older. I couldn't stop reading all three books and I hope that Kinkade is writing more Cape Light Novels."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book because of the authentic characters whose interwoven lives make Cape Light a nice retreat at the end of a long day. I chose this book after reading The Inn at Angel Island, which I thoroughly enjoyed.If you enjoy encountering typical life situations in a small New England community, Cape Light is a welcome retreat where life\`s trials are often a call to prayer, drama is kept to a minimum while everyday situations provide sufficient challenges.I look forward to my next Kinkade and Spencer adventure!"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"THE CAPE LIGHT SERIES, I HAVE READ MOST OF THIS SERIES OF THE FAMILIES OF CAPE LIGHT AND HAVE ENJOYED EVERY ONE.

The lead characters Jessica and Sam have a very powerful relationship that you can't wait to find out what happens. I love that it gives you a realistic story one that many can relate to in their own lives. Easy reading, but enjoyable.

If only other authors could recognize sex and swearing can destroy a good story, and it is not necessary. Other authors make all their characters cuss whenever they open their mouths, thus, all creativity is lost, in addition to all the characters sounding like one person. Anyone who can create a story without filling the pages up with lust and cussing is truly creative! Kinkaid's characters were real and refreshing...a fun and pleasant story."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"In a morally just world, a painter with the talents of Thomas Kinkade would be limited to painting his dopey scenes on the sides of rustic handsaws and flowerpots. But clearly the self-proclaimed &quot;painter of light&quot; has managed to dupe a lot of lowbrow midwesterners into believing that his paintings represent an interesting vision of the world. (Do these same people stock up on Precious Moments figurines as well?) Whatever the case, you can skip this novel. Compared to Kinkade, bad Disney movies seem to created a varied and complex view of character.Most likely you're just scrolling down the Kinkade page for laughs. So I won't going on about this novels lack of merrit. As with other such obviously dumb books, the &quot;reader response&quot; section will soon be come an insult fest. If that's what you're here for, fire away. But make it good."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I don't konw when I've read a worse book. I was expecting something on the order of Jan Karon. Clearly that's what Mr. Kinkade and his writer were trying to emulate, but missed the target by a mile. So sweet it gave me cavities. Without a doubt the painter of light has crossed the line into &quot;over saturation.&quot; I swear if I see another Kinkade painting, plate, birdhouse, afghan or god knows what else, I'm going to hurl. This book is really not worth the money."},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"A horrible painter, an even worse writer.

It's insulting that publishers think we will buy anything just because they deem it &quot;Christian&quot; on the jacket.This book is as boring and unsurpising as Kinkades art has become.

Lawrence \\"Lady Chatterley,s Lover\\" Kinkade has written a subtle, satirical send up of our shallow culture. Like Sherwood Anderson \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" his thinnly masked disdain for smalltown provincialism is skillfully disguised by his overly flowerey stylistic mocking of tepid popular \\"Christian\\" prose. The undercurrent of sexuality is undeniable in the disjointed and fragmented character development. Their frustrated, unfulfilled lives only heighten the sexual tension like a delayed or denied climax. His mocking, even in the title, of our great Presidents Ronald Reagan \\"Shining City on the Hill\\" and George Bush I \\"A Thousand Points of Light\\" must be forgiven with a literary talent this immense. One sees glimmers of Swift and Defoe in this talented newcomer. Bravo Mr.Kinkade!!! What next?? Poetry? Symphonies? Dare I even say it---Film?"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","review":"I love to read christian fiction but this was a bit disapointing. For the first time I actually wished that the main character, Jessica, would just go away. I mean I actually wanted to throw this book out a window a couple of times.

Thats ok - but don't make us wait so long for the next one that we have to end up re-reading this one first to remember the stories.As far as the lesbian mayor - that is so far off base that it doesn't really deserve a comment - but I am going to do it anyhow. First of all the mayor was married and in love untill after two years her husband was killed - I think there are unresolved emotions there. She also had a child. (sorry hope I don't ruin it for anyone.) I think her and the editor of the newspaper will end up getting together.

This book is so much more than how to date. I followed the suggestions to the last detail. I began by looking at previous relationships, what was good and bad about them and what happened. Then I looked at what I wanted in a relationship. I followed suggestions about increasing my network of friends and acquaintances. I paid attention to where I was in the stages of life and where the other people were. There were so many excellent insights into the psychology of relationships and how to match the physical, emotional, intellectual and not settle -- and also why I settled before and how not to. I can't say enough, and after three months I found someone so incredibly right for me I can't believe it, and she feels the same! Thank you so much, Nina Atwood, I'm telling all my single friends about your book!"},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"Want to pick up women? This isn't your book.Want to manipulate men into asking you out? This isn't your book.Want to date with a purpose -- to eventually find and develop a relationship that might become a committed, lifetime relationship nourishing two people? This is it!Nina Atwood combines her professional training, personal experiences and the experiences of those she has counseled, coached and corresponded with to offer insight into the problems, reassurances that you aren't the only one having them, and concrete, achievable solutions.While slightly slanted toward the female experience (like duh), it is only slightly slanted. The male experience, problems and point of view are clearly represented. Males can benefit not only from the direct information, but also from the subtext about what women want and expect (or at least should want and expect).In addition, it isn't just about snaring someone. It is about living a full life, discovering who you truly are, being open and honest both to yourself and the world, and attracting someone who is like you.I can't say enough good about this book.If you have never had problems dating, if you've never wondered why you broke up, if you and your partner always seem to be on the same page, if your relationship is going where you want, if you truly understand what the other is feeling, if you never quarrel about &quot;nothing&quot;, you don't need this book.Otherwise, you cannot afford NOT to buy it."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"The best book about dating relationships I have found... and it's about much more than just getting dates. As a male psychiatrist at a major university student health service where inability to make good choices in finding a healthy relationship is a common presenting complaint I recommend this book when I feel the patient could benefit from some study concerning the matter. Ordinarily I'm not really a fan of what I consider pop psychology but this book is very insightful and gives a good framework for understanding a process that we are taught very little about but somehow we are supposed to know. The reality for most us is learning in a trial and error fashion, often blindly, without much understanding about why things are going so badly and accumulating baggage along the way. There should be a course on this in high school if education is about preparing people for life, and if so, this book would be on my required reading list."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"Ok, I have to give my 2 cents on this book. I am almost done (about 10 more pages left), but I want to give my impression while the ideas are fresh in my mind.First of all, the reason why I like this book is because the targeted audience of this book is geared toward my type of people. I wanted to search for someone that I can share my life with and I'm ready for an exclusive and committed relationship. I really want to know how I can go out and find someone like that will fulfill my needs. If you are someone who wants to know how to date a beautiful model or use the best pick-up lines, then this book isn't for you.I think the bottom line of this book is easy to understand and it's straightforward. This book tells you &quot;not seattle for less.&quot; I think it gives several convincing arguments on why we will be better off if we dump someone that isn't making us happy. Furthermore, the author explains the essential ingredient needed for a healthy relationship. I will not spoil the bean, but I ask a lot of my friends and they all agree that those ingredients are needed.For those of us who is too shy to find a date (a lot of male friend I know is in this situation), this book addresses ways we can expand our chance of finding a date. I think it does a pretty good job of expanding our horizon.Furthermore, this book addresses the importance of communication. I can't agree more. The author delineates common misconceptions that couples faces after the fireworks wear out.This book is much more than a dating book. It teaches interpersonal skills as well.

This book picks up the pace as it goes along, and has good material for having better relationships in general. &quot;Date Lines&quot; is next!"},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"As a man who is in his mid-thirties I am ready to be in a commited relationship. I feel like a lot of the books that are out there are for how to pick up women in thirty seconds and they are somewhat funny but don't help and not what I am after. If you want to read that kind of book look elsewhere. This book provided good advice as far as steps to take to head in the right direction. I bought this with the book &quot;Stumbling Naked in the Dark&quot; upon suggestion of a friend that I work with and they worked well together for me."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"I bought this book after a devastating break up; I was looking for some understanding and help to get though this tough time. The problem in my last relationship was communication so the title of this book was important to me... Boy I'm glad that I found and read Nina's book. It helped me realize the mistake I had made along the way and understand that it wasn't entirely \\"his\\" fault. Through reading this book, I learned how to be honest with my self and how to be honest with others. I thought long and hard about what I want from a relationship, love and life. I have come to the conclusion that EVERYONE should read this book. Relationships truly are a two way street, and the author really knows how to express that. I think that I'm going to go and buy copies for all my good friends and hope that they will get as much out of this book as I did."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"The main theme of the book is to provide a method to have choices of who we date and early in the dating process communicate what is the true potential of the relationship to meet your vision of your future life. The goal is to communicate early so both parties can understand one another and build the relationship from there. The book provides insights into talking about what is important such as religion, spirituality, career, children, money and sexual intimacy. The book details talking about feelings for each other, the relationship potential, where we currently stand, issues that need resolving and an agreement to inform each other if feelings change. It is a book that lets both parties be responsible and truthful about making the dating relationship healthy."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"A real game-plan for dating with the idea of finding a lasting relationship, not just another rollercoaster.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is in a dating relationship and also for pregnant teens and others who are entering into the social/dating world following a break-up.The dialogue is honest, concise, in-depth, and written well. The reader is treated like an intelligent person who can think and make sound judgments when in a dating or other relationship.I especially liked Part II, The Relatiohsip and the chapters dealing with Attachment, Sex, Love, and Communication. These chapters address and discuss what is needed to talk about before entering into a committed exclusive relationship. I read it last year and reviewed several chapters again in 2002 to keep myself on track.Regarding any advice on dating and interpersonal relationships,the information should be assimilated and used prudently. Human behavior is, for the most part, unpredictable and to adhere to a set dating plan or to categorize a person as a North/South/East/Westbound Train is unrealistic. But the book defines the user, non-committed, and unavailable people and lists warining signs of the Westbound (not available for a committment but has a desire to be with you).Dating goals should be based on individual preferences, lifestyle, and needs."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"This book is great. It is a philosophy of being responsible for your destiny in dating and all of life's relationship. The philosophy is to find out your needs and expectations. Then express this to others who you know so that you have a variety of choices of who to date. This creates security and self-esteem in dating. Then communication through &quot;You and Me Conversations&quot; lets each partner be an equal.

For a book written in 1996, I was impressed with the sound strategies and the clear eyed self analysis exercises that force you to look within.

I suspect I may have made the wrong choice.While I'm sure there's good stuff in the book for its intendedaudience, I found it didn't speak to me. I guess it's targetted atAmerican women who are familiar with what the book calls the &quot;singles'scene&quot;, and are probably also Christian.I'm a British man, aged 37, with no religious belief, and nounderstanding of what dating is about. While I was reading the bookI felt I needed more interpretation or guidance about what it wastaking as a starting point. I think I lack some fundamental knowledgeand vocabulary to be able to understand the book. For example, Idon't really know what &quot;dating&quot; means, and I don't think I'drecognize a &quot;singles' bar&quot; if were in one.This isn't a fundamental enough book for me."},{"Title":"Be Your Own Dating Service: A Step-By-Step Guide to Finding and Maintaining Healthy Relationships","review":"I ordered this book and \\"The Temptations of the Single Girl\\" also by Nina Atwood.

The Grand Dame of usage among the ranks of the American Medical Writers Association, Edie Schwager has always demonstrated punctiliousness and precision as thoroughgoing as is her charm. A warmly-welcomed and well-beloved member of AMWA's Delaware Valley Chapter, Edie has always been the first person for whom I've looked whenever I've attended any of the Association's meetings. She educates without condescension and is patient beyond belief.Most of us come to the field of medical writing from a technical background, usually having been trained as scientists, health care providers, or allied professionals. Our compositional experience is generally restricted to communications with peers, and the niceties of precise English usage are not well-appreciated by those of us who scraped through the liberal arts side of our education only narrowly (and that only with the utilization of Cliff's Notes and every other kind of cheat-sheet we could get our hands upon). Enter Edie Schwager's very nice little book of tips and tricks.If you aspire to a career as a writer in the health care field, this book belongs alongside your copy of Stedman's, right next to your copies of Iles' *Guidebook to Better Medical Writing* and Bob Bonk's *Medical Writing in Drug Development*."},{"Title":"Medical English Usage And Abusage:","review":"It is the most reliable book in print today.

The approach is direct, easy to read, and often with entertaining insight and asides from the author. Much advice followed the format of 1) rule, 2) incorrect example, 3) correct example, 4) further explanation.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Runic States: The Shamanic Perception of Quantum Realities","review":"Steffen makes a few interesting observations, but he also has made a number of glaring errors.First and foremost, he is rather insistant in his feeble defense of Blum's \\"Wyrd\\" (blank) rune theory. There is no \\"blank\\" rune. If you are given a set of runes, the \\"blank\\" (of which there should be several) is intended to be inscribed by the owner in the event that a carved rune is either broken or lost. There is NO reference to a \\"blank\\" rune anywhere in the history of runelore (encompassing multiple systems).Secondly, he adds odd correspondences and attributes to each rune (in addition to the \\"traditional\\" ones found in most other books. Apparently (as he is a \\"quantum shaman\\"), Steffen seems to have come up with these new concepts himself, and wishes for them to be accepted as valid.If you've read Aswynn, Thorsson, and Tyson, you might consider taking a look at what Steffen has to say for himself and form your own conclusion."},{"Title":"Runic States: The Shamanic Perception of Quantum Realities","review":"I've done a lot of searching and reading on runes, and I found Steffen's book to have the most informative, straightforward approach yet. Dedicating a page to a page in a half to each rune, he discusses the lore and symbology behind the rune, how it can be applied on a daily basis, and how it connects to other specific runes. Unlike most other books on runes, his descriptions are less cryptic and more easily understandable. I especially found useful his grouping system of the runes, in which certain runes fall into certain families (e.g., travel, victory, protection, and time). These families help add a tremendous degree of clarity to my personal readings. The two main weaknesses to this book are his brief overview of the history of runes, and his discussion of how the runes can be applied to modern-day quantum physics. His premise is unique, but he fails to show how (and why) this is applicable. This is one book every student of the runes should have on his/her bookshelf."},{"Title":"Runic States: The Shamanic Perception of Quantum Realities","review":"I found Runic States informative. Steffen goes into depths about each rune and its relationships with the other runes. The only drawback I found was the fact that It was written from a scientific veiw point(this is not necessarily a bad thing, Its just abit odd to read). Over all i found it a good read and very informative."},{"Title":"Review text in preliminary mathematics","review":"This book is excellent if you (or your child) learn more by verbal cues than by looking at mathematical examples. There are many good examples, but the strength of the book is that it explains preliminary (first through eighth grade) mathematics in paragraph form.It is all inclusive and assumes that more information will not confuse the student. Therefore it does not tell 'part of the story' and then change the rules later. For example, some techniques of teaching the idea that 7+5=12 and 5+7=12 is true, but when you subtract 'always put the big number first' is sometimes taught to elementary students so as not to 'confuse' them. However, any child who has thought about animals that lived 65 million years ago does have a concept of negative numbers. This book explains the WHOLE story for those students who show more curiosity about HOW and why mathematics works than simply the mechanics of arithmetic. Then when students are introduced to absolute value and negative numbers they are not at a complete loss. It has even more value when they are introduced to algebra, geometry and calculus. I used it often as a reference book while in college.It is a fine tool to prepare your child (even if he is mechanically good at arithmetic) for upper level math courses. I wish I could find more copies!"},{"Title":"Appreciative Team Building: Positive Questions to Bring Out the Best of Your Team","review":"Whether the team with which you work is in a large or small business, in a non-profit organisation, or in a community group, you'll find this book a wonderful resource.

He brought back a copy of this poem. It was required reading for my parents growing up - I had never heard of it.I confess I was probably hesitant when I sat down to read it. But in no time I was hooked. The poetic language is perfectly styled to slowly tell the tale of two Acadian lovers doomed by the path of Acadian history to separate lives.

So given that I wasn't really expecting too much but a relief from textbooks when I picked up this book. Little did I know it was soon to become one of my favorites.

Therefore, I was uneasy in the purchase of Evangeline, A Novel. I shouldn't have been. Finis Fox's insight into the lives, loves and losses of the Acadians is remarkable. He adds to the story lines rather than detracting from them. His words are at once romantic and colorful, lulling you into passive reflection. The emotions are all there, the joy, the pain and the suffering. He does not stray far from Longfellow's poem, using the same names of people and places. It is a story worth reading! It would be worth the price if it were twice as much. I wish it could have been longer, but in staying true to Longfellow, the story moved much the same as did the poem.

I study World War two naval battles and find this book facinating.&quot;Admiral&quot; Nathaniel Bartels"},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"This book honors brave Americans who went down with their ships or who survived their sinking. It doesn't contain anything on naval strategy, evaluation of doctrine, characteristics of leadership, strengths and weaknesses of destroyer design, or any basic or advanced questions. The bibliography is thin, although the book took ten years to write. Its language is that of the patrol report: hits on targets give &quot;satisfaction&quot; to crews; fires are &quot;holocaustic;&quot; explosions &quot;volcanic.&quot; Those looking for sea yarns or details should read first-person accounts of those who served on ships of interest. This is not a definitive book on destroyer operations in the Pacific War, but it does show how good men suffered."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"This is a very good reference book. It covers all of the important information that relates to the Destroyer during the war. I wished the book would have been huge, and covered more information about each destroyer, but alas, with so many lost during the war, it would have taken volumes. This book tells you the name, type, date of loss, location of loss, and details on all destroyers lost during WWII. There are mentions of some other ships lost at the same time, but the author chose not to get into other ship types. I really enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down.

While some may find the listing of each ship lost, as repetitious; I found it helpful and a fitting tribute for all the destroyers lost in WWII. In the introduction, the author indicates his desire to convey to later generations, the understanding of what our destroyermen faced - you sir, have succeeded! I found the listing of each ship essential and a fitting reminder for those who make the supreme sacrifice."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"This is the kind of book you can pick up and open to any chapter without losing the thread or missing out on anything. Each chapter is distinct and self-contained. The format for each is the same: capsule biography of the person for whom the ship was named; description of its building, launching, and subsequent patrols; and, brief recounting of the ship's final mission. The connection between the chapters is only accidental, e.g., when two ships were lost in the same engagement, the one which is not the subject of the particular chapter is mentioned in passing. Also, there is not much detailed discussion about the sailors and officers who manned these vessels. The chapters are about the ships, not about the crews, except in those instances where a crew member won a prestigious medal. In sum, this book reads more like a naval vessel catalogue than a book for the interested lay historian. I will keep it among my reference books."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"An excellent work, describing the loss of various classes of U.S. destroyers sunk in WWII. With help from crew members of the many ships, Mr. Parkin describes the horrors of fighting losing battles against man and nature. Having served aboard a Fletcher class DD in the Viet Nam conflict, I can appreciate the efforts by which the &quot;tin can sailors&quot; of WWII fought to keep their ships afloat under circumstances that can only be described as hellish. This book also contains short biographical data of the men for whom each ship was named, and at the end of each description of loss, data such as ship class, launching and loss dates, sponsor, builder, keel laying,commanding officers at time of commissioning and loss, and place where the ship was lost is featured, in addition to awards won by the ship.

Subtitled: \\"American Destroyers Lost In World War II\\"Sarpedon Publishing, Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. 1995.The U.S. Navy lost 71 destroyers in World War II; their stories are told in this book. Some of the ships were sunk by enemy gun fire. Some of these \\"tin cans\\" were sunk by Kamikaze action. Others were lost to the all powerful sea. Each of the 71 vessels is given a short, (perhaps 3 pages on average) history.The book's general format begins each of the 71 sections with a few paragraphs on the history of the name of the destroyer. Once, it was Navy policy to name battleships after states, aircraft carriers after battles, cruisers after cities and so on. Destroyers were named after people who were famous in naval history or who had performed some act of gallantry, or good performance in the naval service. For example, the USS Blue (DD-387) was named for Rear Admiral Victor Blue (1865-1928) who had \\"...excellent intelligence missions in Cuba during the Spanish-American War...\\" and later commanded the battleship \\"New York... during her service ... in World War I\\". (Page 78).The next part of each section deals with the actions the destroyer was involved in and the cause of the sinking of that ship. In the back of the book, there is an appendix summarizing the various methods used to sink the American destroyers: naval gun fire, Kamikaze attack, explosion, storm and so on. The book lists the sinking of the destroyer in general chronological order. Interestingly, the first destroyer sunk by enemy action in World War II was the USS Reuben James (DD-245), lost on October 31, 1941, some five weeks before the dastardly Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The notes on the torpedoing of the Reuben James show that her captain, Lt. Commander H. L. Edwards, died when the ship was lost.So, each section gives a history of the ship's name, a brief listing of the actions the destroyer was involved in, how she was sunk and where she was sunk. I was intrigued by the single ship listed as \\"scuttled\\". The American naval tradition is never to scuttle a ship. The USS Stewart, (DD-224), was involved in the disastrous retreat of the American, British, Dutch and Australian navies before the onslaught of the Imperial Japanese Navy, early in the war. The USS Stewart was disabled and brought to a floating to dry-dock in Surabaya. The dry-dock collapsed , trapping the damaged vessel, so the Stewart's crew was split up amongst other ships and the trapped vessel blown up with demolition charges. The explosives did not do a complete job, and, as the author, Robert Parkin, recounts, ...\\"the frugal Japanese had raised the damaged destroyer, effected temporary repairs and ...(incorporated her) ... as Imperial Japanese Navy Shoaki-tei...Patrol Boat 102\\". Interesting story.Finally, there were those destroyers sunk by the might of the ocean, off Iceland, or on the rocks near Nova Scotia, or by that famous (infamous) typhoon in the Pacific. Navy Hymn: \\" Oh hear us when we cry to Thee for those in peril on the sea.\\"The author, Parkin, has done an excellent job of gathering much information in one place. You can read the book from front to back, in more or less chronological order, or you can skip from ship to ship, depending upon your interests. All in all, this is a fine book."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"IN A NUTSHELL: AN HONORABLE AND WELL EXECUTED EPITAPH TO BRAVE MEN & THEIR SHIPSEvery one of the 71 lost destroyers has a story. Most of the stories go beyond their last action and include other actions which are noteworthy.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: 71 CHAPTERS ABOUT 71 LOST SHIPS & THEIR CREWSEach ship gets a chapter and they all start out with a short biography of the ship's namesake. Then, actions in which the ships received 'Battle Stars' or citations are concisely discussed, always ending with the ships last action, for which the most detail and space is reserved.Their are several clusters of photos which include some of the destroyers included in this volume. Some show extreme battle damage that is survived until a later action and some show the ships in prime condition cutting through the waves at 30 knots.BUT THERE IS MORE: APPENDICES HELP TO GRASP THE SUBJECTAPPENDIX A]- AMERICAN DESTROYER CLASSES OF WW2----- Brief listing of the various destroyers that were used in WW2, could have included more detail.APPENDIX B]- THE HONOR ROLL----- List of the U.S. Destroyers that were subsequently named in honor of the officers and men who are listed in this volume.APPENDIX C]- U.S. DESTROYER LOSSES [ALPHABETICAL ORDER]APPENDIX D]- THE \\"DIVINE WIND\\"----- A list or about 57 Destroyers that survived 'Kamikaze' attacks [with significant casualties].APPENDIX E]- DESTROYER ESCORTS----- A short explaination of the difference between 'Destroyers' and 'Destroyer Escorts' as well as their varying roles.BOTTOM LINE: FITTING AND HONORABLE REQUIEM FOR MANY LOST SAILORSEach short chapter that covers the life and death of one ill-fated destroyer reads like a fitting memorial to the families of these young men whose lives were dramatically cut short."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"In some ways, Blood on the Sea is a very tough read. The author gives a brief history of every US Destroyer that was lost during WW2, 71 in total. That's 71 short chapters of sinking's, air or sea battles, fires, battles, torpedoes and toss in a few groundings, hurricanes and collisions, that adds up to a lot of sorrow. But then again, there is a tremendous amount of courage, self sacrifice, heroism and bravery to offset that sorrow.Author Robert Parkin served for 20 years in the navy knows of what he writes and was able to speak with many of the survivors who were able to bear witness to what happened. It's amazing how much punishment these sleek craft could take and the pride of each crew who knew that there ship simply was the best on the ocean, bar none. I also liked the intro to each ship - destroyers are named after naval heroes dating back to the Revolutionary war. A few select B&W; photos to show the different classes of destroyers, the appendix has statistical data of destroyers and a short, concise bibliography of sources.This is a very factual, fitting tribute to the memories who served, especially during the early phases of the war when the US was still learning the ropes. A tough emotional read, perhaps best done in small doses, but it's a good book."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"I purchased this book to learn about a subject I knew little about. I have since become fascinated with the subject.It is story in brief, of every American Destroyer lost during the Second World War.It is the kind of book you could read at one (very long) seating, or read on the hurry - one ship at a time. If you like tales of the sea, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"I would consider this book to be more a reference book on the destroyers lost during World War II. In this book we have descriptions of the seventy-one U.S. destroyers that were lost during this war. Their individual accounts include eyewitness accounts of their finale hours.Relates the ships' launchings and naming, their tour of duty, and the causes of their destruction. These include a short overview of the Ship's namesake and a short yet detailed account of what citations the ships received and their final action that resulted in their destruction and inclusion in this book.The author makes it quite clear that this book is about these seventy-one U.S. destroyers' final days and not a study of the great battles that they were in. If you are seeking out a book that covers the strategy and tactics of these destroyers, this is not the book for you. I find this to be a great reference guide and a good addition to my library of naval history."},{"Title":"Blood on the Sea: American Destroyers Lost in World War II","review":"Robert Sinclair is the bomb!

The plot hangs together by a thread, and the coquetry is forced but Dam has stitched a gossamer-light read with sumptuous material and gentle ribbing. The author tries to deliver a funny story with the ups and downs of the fashionista's world but it's just not enough for the glorified reader.Read it if you get it for free or if there's nothing else to read but don't think you will be blown away since this is just way too light to capture your heart."},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"This snooze fest is not even worth checking out of the Library.

Admittedly, I thought it would be a silly beach book, something in the Bridget Jones line. I *wanted* it to be a big, brainless beach book. But wow, was I disappointed.First, the plot. It involves some lame love story and its complications. But she writes about the sparks between her two protagonists as if she's passing a note in Junior High Bio class. He's soooooo cuuute 4 shur!!!! And then, there's the mystery at the heart of it. Again, not expecting Agatha Christie here, but her little intrigue didn't even make sense, and even the author seemed bored with it. It's as if she just wanted to write catty stuff making fun of people who go to fashion shows, but her editor made her slam a mystery and love story in there, too.And then there's the question of place. Has the author ever been to Paris? Seriously, I doubt it. (She gets lots of little pieces wrong, and they start to grate.) I think her knowledge of the subject consisted of a few internet searches, watching the fashion channels on cable for a little while, and a Parisian picture book. Seriously.It started out okay. She has funny asides about designers, and calls the Hilton sisters the Sheraton sisters. Not totally brilliant, but cute. But then she mentions Paris Hilton by name later in the book. Did she space out about her earlier reference? Was her editor not paying attention?I didn't have big expectations--I just wanted something that would hold my interest and be about as well-written as US Magazine. Whoops. Not even close, and how scary is that? Who gave this book the green light, anyway?"},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"This book is really boring and I love chick lit. It is so boring that each time I pick it up I forget what I read before. The story line in this book is going no-where fast. I'm up to chapter 3 and I just can't face reading anymore. It is a mystery to me why it is coming out in paperback. Maybe so less people will be hurt when it's flung across a room in disgust?"},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"It is Fashion Week in Paris and SOME LIKE IT HAUTE. Haute Couture is a French phrase for high fashion. Alex Simons, style writer for The Weekly magazine, has her complete head to toe outfit for each runway show she will be attending entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Every piece of clothing --- including her black La Perla bra with matching thong, Chanel skirt, trusty black jacket, Tahitian pearl choker, Mabe ring and black Balenciaga bag --- is laid out and ready to slip on. But, \\"Oh no,\\" her Manolo slingbacks are missing. Thus begins our adventure with Alex's obsession with shoes, shopping and the exclusive world of Haute Couture in Paris.For most women, Parisian design houses are a fantasy land splashed across the pages of Vogue and W magazines. We look at the photos of perfect models dressed in Valentino, Chanel, Gucci, Dior, Givenchy, Yves St. Laurent, Prada and other famous designers with desire, envy and yearning. Alex reports, \\"Wearing couture suddenly made you stand straighter and taller, move a little more alluringly.\\" Lust takes on a new meaning as we imagine ourselves in the VIP rooms being measured and fitted for a designer gown to wear for a special man or special occasion.SOME LIKE IT HAUTE fulfills our fantasies and speaks to the indulgent shopper behind those Chanel sunglasses wearing those Manolo Blahnik designer shoes. Designer shoes and accessories have become the sophisticated woman's entree into Haute Couture and leading lady status. With the increased profiles of American and European shoe designers Manolo Blahnik, Christian Louboutin, Stuart Weitzman, Jimmy Choo and Prada, coupled with Carrie's obsession with stilettos in HBO's hit \\"Sex and the City,\\" women have permission to indulge in jewels for the feet.Alex Simon's guilty pleasure is designer shoes, and she shares this pleasure and a description of each unrestrained purchase. I have to admit, there's a certain adrenaline rush to buying sexy shoes. I'll never forget The Harrods Sale slogan, \\"Real temptation...\\" I was giddy at the first sight of the monumental temple of designer items, tempted by the word \\"sale,\\" intoxicated by the time I got to Luxury Room number two and one pair of sexy designer shoes richer when I reluctantly left at closing time. Shopping is a sensory experience that fuels our fantasies and turns them into reality via temptation and indulgence. Like Alex, I can define my life by the ultra sexy shoes called \\"Lightshow\\" I bought with a best friend at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, those little gold sandals purchased at Harrods, and shoes that were complimented by a man or a stranger. There is little doubt in this reviewer's mind why shoes and couture shows are the themes of SOME LIKE IT HAUTE.Julie K.L. Dam's debut novel is the Bible of the \\"haute\\" shopping experience. \\"I didn't even ask the price; I just jumped right in.\\" When we really want something, isn't this what we all do? Haute Couture is artistry. Shopping is an art too. Alex defines herself through \\"retail therapy,\\" as she calls it. The \\"ceremonial rites of browsing and buying\\" are more meaningful\\" when she is getting over a man, forgetting an ordeal at work, or her public collision with a model during the Chanel showing in Paris. Alex heads to Prada for consolation, where she brazenly says to the saleswoman amidst a room full of clothes and accessories, \\"I'll take it. All of it.\\"Excusez-moi, but what fantasy land in Paris would be complete without romance? Lucky for Alex, Nick Snow makes the same collision faux paux and the headlines replace Alex as Scandal of the Week. Alex and Nick meet at a showing of Luis-Heinz, a mysterious new designer. A kidnapping plot is unnecessary and out of place in this fashionista novel. The romance between Alex and Nick is treated lightly, without any real substance beyond the 25-dozen red roses Nick sends to apologize for keeping his purpose in Paris a secret for so long. Romance should be light and fun, especially in Paris.The perfect Hermes tie, and \\"sparkling and hazel, almost gray\\" eyes bring Alex and Nick together, and we are treated to accurate descriptions of their ride past the Parisian shopping landmark Bon Marche, the Eiffel Tower, along the Champs-Elysees and the Seine. In an interesting and mainstream twist, Nick shares his guilty pleasure with Alex with this revelation: \\"Alex, I'm a contestant on a reality-TV show.\\" Alex is livid --- I won't give the premise away. True to Alex's identity, she compares the fight for a man to a fight for a pair of shoes on sale at Bergdorf's. In my opinion, if anyone could understand Nick's TV fetish, it would be a member of the media and a shoe whore.\\"You could toss a pebble anywhere in Paris and hit a romantic spot.\\" You can also toss a credit card anywhere in Paris and buy a pair or two or three of designer shoes to remember your Parisian shopping experience. Before you say \\"Au revoir\\" to Paris or the nearest upscale mall, splurge on designer shoes. When one is \\"haute,\\" one is \\"hot.\\"--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"I really ejoyed reading this book. It has a bit of mystery and keeps you on your toys.

I enjoy chick lit novels and this was that combined with a lesson in fashion. I learned alot about Paris, fashion week, and designers.

Currently she covers Fashion Week in Paris with it's Tuesday it's Chanel. However, she makes an unbecoming entrance when her face and the left breast of six foot Latvian model Kayarina collide in a catwalk incident that makes the news. Humiliated, Alex wants to hide, but her editor tells her to write it up and get back to covering the shows.Alex attends the debut gala of designer Luis-Heinz, whose talent has everyone salivating. She tries to interview the brilliant recluse, but he refuses to talk to the media. Instead American consultant Nick Snow, the anti-fashion centerfold hunk, distracts her. The New Yorker is in town as a reality TV show star trying to obtain dates with models. When she learns why he is in town, Alex distrusts him even though he dumped the six foot models for her. However, when Heinz vanishes, Alex begins a quest to find him hoping to be compensated with one of his magical designs.This lighthearted satire is fun to read starting with the boob accident and never losing one Manolo step along the way in spite of some strange seemingly out of the fashion mainstream sidebars like the appearance of the French teacher and the hunt for Heinz. The story line never takes itself serious using the cast (except Nick) to portray the graveyard dead seriousness of the industry; for instance Alex uses Excel to dress properly. As the glaring exception Nick is a big dark stain on a white blouse. Fans of fashionable chick lit tales will enjoy this flippant reverence to fashion.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"I visit a website by the same name and had been looking forward to reading this for some time.

How many times can the author make dumb 80s-hairspray references? You will honestly lose count. And repeatedly pointing out that the heroine has a \\"great education\\" which she's wasting by being a fashion journalist? That's fairly insulting to people who enjoy fashion and think it's important, as well as being overly-reductive about the value of education.

Too bad this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"It was a little early for \\"beach reads\\" when this book was originally released, but it should fit right in this summer. It's fun, light reading with characters who are mostly likable and a story that goes over the top just a little. Clearly not for the \\"fashion-illiterate\\", so if you don't know the difference between Chanel & Prada, or don't know who Michael Kors or Marc Jacobs are, you'll probably find this a little boring. But if you're a \\"fashionista\\" & enjoy a fashion-related \\"guilty pleasure\\" every now & then, this book is definitely for you!! Frequent name-drops of some of today's top designers & trendy celebrities can be found on nearly every page, which adds some fun (There's even a tongue in cheek reference to the \\"Hilton\\" sisters as our main character attends the same party as the \\"Sheraton Sisters\\"!). Designers from Prada to Chanel to YSL to Stella McCartney and so, so many more make such frequent appearances that it's almost like the designers & their clothes, shoes, handbags & accessories are supporting characters in the story! Definitely written with fashion-lovers in mind (what else would you expect from an editor from People mag?!) (WARNING! Do not attempt to read this book anywhere near the mall or while you have access to you computer & credit card!! Shopping is not recommended within 60 minutes of reading this book!!!)If you need a break from deep, moving, emotional stories with characters you become emotionally invested in & attached to, you might want to give this one a try. It won't take you anytime to get through it & shouldn't give you much pause for thought!! It's a very light, fluffy, fun read that doesn't take much thought at all. Your only emotional involvement in the characters might be envy, as one might only dream of having a closet or clothing allowance like Alex's!!!The last third of the book is definitely over the top with a pretty imaginative story that's just a little unbelievable - but if you can look past that and read it just for fun, you should find it entertaining. I appreciate the effort that Julie Dam made to write a story that's an escape from the \\"real world\\" of today. For just a little while each day, I was happy to put aside the trials & tribulatons that is my real life & enjoyed spending time with Alex & her friends in the City of Paris and the crazy, unrealistic world of fashion. Everyone needs a break and needs to have a little fun now & then - SOME LIKE IT HAUTE, if anything, will put a smile on your face, cause you to roll you eyes once or twice, and forget about being a grown up for just a little while!!! Isn't that what reading's all about after all?? Taking time out of each day just to relax & escape for a little while. This book definitely did that for me!!I look forward to what else this author brings us & whether or not she's able to sustain the level, or whether she takes dive along the lines of Plum Sykes & Lauren Weisberger, who delivered very entertaining first-run novels, but seemed to lose themselves in their subsequent attempts!

This commentary may seem harsh but I really did try to like to book and I made myself finish it. However, from Alex's whining about her mistakes in her predetermined outfit organization, to the fact that Paris is teeming with people from Texas, I overdosed in cheesiness. The plot thins more so when Alex hears of her love interests \\"big secret\\", bizarro at best.All I can honestly say is that anyone who is interested in fashion and designers has the same amount of knowledge as Alex, who sadly has a career in writing about it.

Imagining myself as Alex playing dress up at Chanel, shoe shopping, dining at outdoor cafes, and fighting Parisians for taxis literally took me away like a Calgon bubble bath.Not only was the story a suspenseful page turner, the references to the 80s, both music and hair, were precious. Most of all, I laughed out loud at the clever comments the author makes throughout the novel: highlighting the anxiety that a 30-something who went to high school in the 80s (in Dallas, no less!) would experience today \\"committing to bangs\\" or \\"declaring orange the new black\\". This book simultaneously embraces and satirizes the modern woman's \\"no brainer\\" of sacrificing comfort for fashion. As a reader, I cheered Alex on as she donned the \\"rubber dress\\" and stilettos, only to get busted \\"adjusting\\" while waiting for the elevator.I'd be first in line to see this as a movie, and I can't wait to read the sequel.Reader beware: I admit I succumbed to the seductive salespeople at Saks after reading this book.

Her dreams have carried her far from her big-hair days in Texas, landing a career as a fashion correspondent on first-name basis with all top fashion houses' PR reps.A sudden cat-walk collision with this season's \\"It girl\\" lands Alex in the midst of a media feeding frenzy that has her cowering in her hotel watching reruns of the debacle on Fashion TV. When she ventures out to a promising fashion debut she meets Nick Snow, a bad boy who spurns the fashion world but sends Alex's pulse into overdrive. Will this fashion insider get her bad boy and the scoop of the year?This latest entry into the increasingly crowded genre of chick lit offers a breath of fresh air. Some Like it Haute has avoided many of the major minefields now infesting the genre: heroines stuck in their 20's, overly whiny main characters and paper-thin plots.Julie Dam recognizes that the readers of chick lit have moved into their 30s and, while still concerned with fashion and romance, they also face serious worries about their careers. By moving her heroine into the next age category but leaving her single, the author has taken a courageous yet fresh approach.Within the context of haute couture and Paris' fashion week, Alex's obsession with clothes and footwear makes sense. The insider's view of this closed society is enthralling and since Alex's clothes obsession isn't overblown, she shows readers an insider's view into this elite world.One of Julie Dam's main strengths is her ability to pen intelligent, rapid-fire banter: words delivered so fast that your head is spinning in admiration. Some Like it Haute contains some fabulous repartee between Nick and Alex, chocked full of pop culture references and delivered with deadpan accuracy. Like the icons of old, the sexual tension leaps off the page as Nick and Alex play with words as easily as others toss dice.More style than substance, this light-weight confection has readers kicking off their kitten heels and curling their toes in longing for the Manolos casually tossed around by Alex.Armchair Interviews says: Dam has provided a window into a world guaranteed to delight any wanna-be fashionista, a stylistic fable that marries mystery and romance and wraps it all in a glamorous world filled with killer shoes."},{"Title":"Some Like It Haute","review":"While I wasn't expecting this book to be deep and meaningful, I DID expect it to be at least a little entertaining.

After completing one level of Huna training she purchased an Ouija board at Wal-Mart (!) and convinced herself she was communicating with the ghost of Max Freedom Long, the first person to write about Huna in the thirties. Inspired by that, she went to Hawaii and did some research which persuaded her that Max Freedom Long's books were inaccurate and that he made up much of what he wrote. Shelley's book is quite readable and well written. However, on some points her argument falls completely apart.Max Freedom Long says in his books that he never met a kahuna while he was in Hawaii, that he did become friends with Dr. Brigham of the Bishop Museum, and that everything he wrote about Huna came from Dr. Brigham and the Hawaiian Dictionary. Shelley accurately points out that none of these statements are true. Shelley has done an honest and courageous job of exposing the myths, but regrettably she stopped short of discovering the truth. Her documentary research is excellent but to arrive at the end of the story she resorted to Ouija boards, conversations with ghosts banging on the walls of her house, and automatic writing, whereas IMO she should have continued exploring documents. The truth is that Huna was illegal when Max was in Hawaii, that he studied under two kahunas, and that they gave him permission to publish some of what they taught him, provided that he conceal their identities. That he did with the silly stories about Dr. Brigham and the Hawaiian Dictionary which Shelley has thoroughly debunked. All of this came out after his death and after Huna was legalized. Like Shelley, I, too, was unimpressed with the obvious phoniness of these stories, and interviewed a woman in 1986 who studied in Hawaii with several kahunas. She told me that not only were Long's books accurate representations of Huna teaching, but that there were a lot of people in Hawaii who were angry that this information had been published. It is true, as the Kaehr book points out, that the popular understanding of such terms as aumakua and unihipili are different from the secret, esoteric meanings given by Long. But was Long wrong? Not according to people who have spent considerable time in the islands studying with real kahunas. We should note that Ms. Kaehr herself does not claim to have studied with any kahunas while in Hawaii, although she did do some valuable research with others who also did not study under any kahunas. So Ms. Kaehr's book is partly right so long as it depends on documentation, and dead wrong when its statements are based on ghostly visitations and things that go bump in the night (or bang, as the case might be). I say this in the hope that she will bring out a second edition in which these flaws are corrected. It should also be said that Max Freedom Long's bona fides or lack thereof have no bearing on the teachings of Clark Wilkerson, Serge King, or Tad James, all of whom studied in Hawaii, and none of whom claim to have learned everything they know from a dictionary, or from Long, for that matter. All three of these teachers have tipped their hat to Max Freedom Long as the first mainland author to write about Huna and acquaint stateside readers with this ancient Polynesian form of spirituality. It is absurd to say that no one should study under any of these teachers or their students because of Ms. Kaehr's experience with a Ouija board. After all, someone else might look at some tea leaves or something and decide not to study under Ms. Kaehr and then where would we be? Would that make any sense? We need better information than her presumed seances to make intelligent decisions.So I would give this book two stars. Two for the part that is half right, and minus three for the part that is all wrong."},{"Title":"Origins of Huna: Secret Behind the Secret Science","review":"This decendants and friends of Max Freedom Long (MFL) should file a lawsuit against this author for slander and libel.I have two friends that were also friends of MFL. and from these friends, and the writings of MFL I do NOT get the notion that MFL was a liar.1. Ms. Kaehr allegedly contacted the spirit of MFL by Ouija board then through automatic writing.This is research for a book?.2. Ms. Kaehr said that MFL contacted her because he was guilty about the lies he told.MFL was a sincere dedicated researcher, and spent the last 52 years of his life trying to reclaim the secrets of the kahunas.3. Ms. Kaehr states categoricaly that William Tufts Brigham and MFL could never have met.MFL went to the islands in 1917, and began hearing stories of kahunas almost immediately, and Dr. Brigham did not retire from his position as curator of the Bishop museum in 1918.4. Ms. Kaehr said that HUNA is a form of Wicca.MFL began his research of HUNA in 1918 and ended at his death in 1971. Wicca did not exist before Gerald B. Gardner went public in 1949 after the witchcraft laws were overturned.Any one of those four examples is enough to leave the book sit on the shelf.Now let me explain why MFL made errors in his research.MFL had several things working against him, and in a few places he added 2 and 2 and came up with 6.a. MFL was a ha'ole and the Hawaiians would not talk to him for fear of persecution.b. It was illegal for American Indians and Hawaiians to practise their spirituality before the freedom of religion act in 1978.c. MFL was convinced there had to be a direct line of teachers, and he completely overlooked the mystical (people going into the silence and discovering matters of the soul). The Hawaiians, the Druids, the Lakota indians, the Jewish kabbalaists, and the mongolian shamans, and others all knew of three parts of the soul even though they give the parts different names.d. MFL took prayers and chants apart to discover the meanings of the root words. well that hawaiian/english dictionary was 70 years old, and hopelessly out of date.If you want a list of good HUNA books; go see my HUNA 1 listmania list, read my \\"So you'ld like to study HUNA and change your life\\", and read my HUNA 101 web page. http://...Aloha nui loa.

According to her week long on site research in the state of Hawaii in which she claims she was attacked by a dog and she scared a bull which she interprets as a sign that Max Freedom Longs work is invalid, she apparently spent the week going to various \\"haole\\" tourists traps such as the penis rock to arrive at her conclusions. Most of her conclusions are based on second and third hand accounts and there is very little direct first hand validation other than her ouija board revelations from Max Freedom Long himself. She makes numerous attacks and innuendos against the other huna teachers like Serge King , James etc. However, she makes no attempt at contacting these people or their teacher such as Laura Yardly, George Naope,Vinson Wingo's son, Hew Len, Daddy Bray's family etc. Instead she goes to the Bishop Museum, the University of Hawaii, and Polynesian Cultural Center (run by the Mormon Church) who are as a group (primarily dominated by \\"haole\\"s) are not the most unbiased individuals. They tell her of course Huna concepts are nonsense and no real Kahunas have existed since 1819. She than explains some basic concepts of the \\"true religion and culture of the ancient Hawaiians\\" which she either gleamed from the pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica which she mentions in her references or she got it while touring the Polynesian Cultural Center. Any child that would have attended elementary school in the state of Hawaii could have told you the same thing and same stories yet she devotes half the book to explain the so called true Hawaiian culture. Just as the school children are taught, she claims that there have not been practicing Kahuna in Hawaii since 1819. In the end despite her exhaustive week long search for Kahuna, the only thing she find is a rabid dog and a bull. Her search for the Kahuna was in vain. Of Course if there are true Kahuna in the State of Hawaii, and they do have second sight, I know why the did not talk to her........personally I would not waste your money on this book.......Aloha"},{"Title":"Origins of Huna: Secret Behind the Secret Science","review":"I have never done a review before due to the limited free time I have but feel it is necessary.

The only thing I had been able to find is the writings of Max Freedom Long on something he called Huna. I never understood the lack of information available. Dr. Shelley Kaehr, in her wonderful scholarship, takes on that conundrum and follows it to its inevitable conclusion. While this ending may not thrill everyone, it's conclusion is self-evident. Through her personal journey, Dr. Kaehr takes us on a trip through history and reveals the source of the secrecy of native hawaiian religion and more importantly puts the tradition of Huna in its proper perspective. This scholarly work reads like a suspenseful detective story with a surprise ending. I recommend it for all who seek to expand their knowledge base of the world's many spiritual traditions."},{"Title":"Origins of Huna: Secret Behind the Secret Science","review":"The author began her experience with Huna, believing the fabrications of Max Freedom Long and ended up by going to Hawaii to learn for herself the truth about Huna thinking. She performs the dissection of the belief with great aplomb and instead of gloating over her discoveries, rather expresses what is good about the belief. The book has been well thought out and written in an unbiased fashion. The most telling aspect of her research is that she dedicates the book to the Huna fouder, Max Long. That should say it all both to those Huna believers and to those who might want to learn about it."},{"Title":"Origins of Huna: Secret Behind the Secret Science","review":"I liked the book because it tells a compelling story about the author's journey to find truth.

To those looking to nourish your spirit, look within yourself. Max Freedom Long, Serge King, and any other self-proclaimed \\"Huna Master\\" and their followers are just a bunch of haoles that have found yet another way to cash in on the Hawaiian culture. This book was wonderful in that it points out how you should be careful of what you spend your money on, don't believe everything you read, and always be true to yourself. The huna people are disrespectful of the Hawaiian people, the very people they try to emulate! I hope more books come out to expose this sham. However, the author did remain bias in her research. There are those who scoff at the fact that she used a quija board to aid in her discoveries, but I scoff at them for falling blindly into a religion/cult/belief system based on lies. They want to keep telling themselves what they want to hear, fine, but it shouldn't be at the expense of the Hawaiians.

It's the art of taking people into their own dreams where attention to the secret movements, tricked props etc becomes secondary.

I decided to do some research, came across this book, and nearly wept with relief.Our current school system is dominated by women who fail to understand the psychology of boys. Prior to having sons, I believed that boys were rambunctious and agressive due to socialization. Like most parents, I learned otherwise; boys are different - and this does not make them bad. I am tired of teachers saying the word \\"boys\\" while rolling their eyes, as if being a boy implies the existence of some inherent defect. It's insulting, unfair, and serves to seriously damage our sons' chances of doing well academically. Boys are in an educational crisis - and it's a manufactured one.If you have a son who kicks over the neighbour's snowman, climbs on the roof of the school, falls off his chair in class, gets into fights on the playground, annoys his teachers, blurts things out, and is generally considered a \\"problem\\", chances are, he's absolutely normal. Our intolerance to the energy of boys has led to millions of male children being medicated. It's an outrage, and parents need to confront the school systems and their attempts to feminize the male population. They can't run, they can't jump, they can't be competitive. They're supposed to act like girls, all quiet and co-operative, and when they don't - out with the ritalin.Here's something I learned: Our son has never been allowed a toy gun, and yet he draws them constantly, tries to find books on guns in the library, chews his toast into the shape of a pistol, etc. His teacher was concerned, and called us in for a meeting about it.This is a child who does not play video games, watch violence on tv, and is encouraged to be kind and compassionate. But there he is, drawing pictures of gangsters with machine guns. This book explained that it's a pretty normal thing. Our son got in trouble at school and lied to us about it. Again, fairly typical.Our son is easily distracted - why? Because of \\"co-operative learning\\" where kids' desks are all shoved together. This works for GIRLS, not boys! I requested an alternative seating arrangement.If you're worried about your son, you must read this book. It has changed my life.

Stosh found a job so he would have some pocket money. He was be paid 5 dollars a day to clean out the attic of an elderly women in his neighborhood. When searching through some old boxes, he came upon a very valuable 1909 Honus Wagner baseball card in mint condition. He knew that this could be his chance to be rich.

He then gets up and gets ready for his upcoming baseball game. At the game, Stosh hit the ball upwards and the catcher caught it. His team lost the game. He walked back home with his head sagging and upon arrival, he sees Honus Wagner sitting on his front steps.Honus Wagner's mysterious appearance in Stosh's bedroom was all because of the baseball card.

This is a awesom sports book, in my opinion. Honus is a awesom baseball player whose catcher said \\"he was the best baseball player, and he caught flies like nothing he could throw from his back all the way to first base for the out\\". Sastos meets Honus by using his baseball cards to travel back through time.I like the book Honus and Me by Dan Gutman because I like baseball books and baseball.I know we can't travel through time, but if we could it would be cool, so we could meet some of these baseball players."},{"Title":"Honus and Me: A Baseball Card Adventure","review":"This book is about a boy named Joey Stoshack.

I enjoyed this book because it was based on sports. (Baseball) this was cool cause I could make a lot of connections.There were a couple of scenes in Honus and Me that were truly enjoyable. Including when Stoshack batted for Honus while Honus cleaned up his hand after Ty Cobb's cleats spiked him. Another favorite scene was when Miss Young came out with her shotgun and broke the fight up between Stoshack and Birdie who was trying to take the t-206 Honus Wagner card.If I could change one thing in this book I would have let Stoshack keep at least one of the Honus cards. I think the author didn't let him because he was trying to show a lesson.A few things were learned from reading this book such as always doing the wright thing. Even if it can make you mad. One thing I gained from reading this book was that even if people are bowlegged they shouldn't be judged."},{"Title":"Honus and Me: A Baseball Card Adventure","review":"To start out my review, I would like to point out that \\"Honus and Me\\" is not correct grammar. It should be \\"Honus and I\\", but then again, \\"Honus and Me\\" sounds more like it's coming from a kid's point of view, and that's exactly where it comes from. Joe Stoshack tells the story of a strange feeling he gets when he holds a baseball card, and how it turns into something else. This book contains true information about Honus Wagner. I listened to the book on tape, and at the end, they explained some more about Honus. I'm not sure if that is in the book or not. The ending left something to be desired, I felt, but I still enjoyed it! I would definately recommend this book to any baseball fan!"},{"Title":"Honus and Me: A Baseball Card Adventure","review":"Honus and Me is a great book. It's about this little boy named Joe.

I am an African American and do not feel that elementary school kids are ready for this word. Others disagree with me but just be ready to explain the meaning of this word if you read Jackie and Me.

While he is time traveling, he is trying to meet famous baseball players from the past such as Lou Gehrig, Honus Wagner, and Jackie Robinson. I can relate to this character because Joey has dreams of meeting famous baseball players. The character also has a perfectly normal teenage life, just like me, except for the traveling through time part. Joey is an excellent baseball player, and plays shortstop. Just like Joey, I practice baseball at least ten hours a week.This author, Dan Gutman, also writes a ton of other books. He writes Jackie and Me, Shoeless Joe and Me, and Honus and Me. He generally writes his books based on sports. If you like sports, I would definitely recommend this author. He writes his baseball books with a little bit of science fiction in them, which I really enjoy. Dan makes the reader get interested in the book right away. The author has convinced me to want to go back in time and become a teammate of Shoeless Joe Jackson.I recommend this book to anybody that has a dream of meeting a famous baseball player from the past. I enjoyed this book and I think that anybody that reads it will like it as well."},{"Title":"Honus and Me: A Baseball Card Adventure","review":"The book I am reviewing is Honus & Me written by Dan Gutman. I think this deserves four stars. It's a very good book because it is about baseball and adventure. It has the world's most valuable card. This book is about a boy who is not very good at baseball. One day he is cleaning his neighbor's house, who is very old. When he finds an old baseball card and a ripped picture of the old lady When he touches the card he feels a tingling feeling. When he holds the card long enough he goes into the year 1909. When he travels in time Honus asks him questions. Then he takes Joey (the boy) to the World Series game but the manager ripped the card.

This book was a historical fiction, mystery, and was an adventure. You would like this book if you are interested in baseball. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a book giving info on a past historical person. You will learn a lot about baseball and you will learn a lot about Honus Wagner. This book was a page turner because of the many conflicts that arise. Every ending in a chapter ended in a cliffhanger. Part of one cliffhanger was that Stoshack goes to the card shop and ends. Stoshack makes you wonder that if this card is really valuable or a piece of garbage. I would like to read another book from this author because all that Dan Gutman writes is famous baseball players meeting the present day. This book was definitely not boring and you should see for yourself. It gives too much info and too much suspense for you to get bored.

The book includes some very interesting non-fiction about how the card came about and why it is so rare."},{"Title":"Honus and Me: A Baseball Card Adventure","review":"This is one of the best in the Joe Stoshack series, the boy who travels in time to meet some of baseball's legends. Gutman excels at evoking baseball's early years, when the game was more intimate and perhaps rougher. Gutman really did his research: \\"People were hanging all over the fence, and there were seats in front [italics] of the fence. The only thing keeping fans away from the playing field was a rope.\\" Gutman also includes some play by play descriptions from the 1909 Series.Gutman supplements these descriptions with newspaper clipings, great photos (including one of Wagner and Cobb, and what I assume is the Detroit field, \\"Bennett Park,\\" in 1909), a reproduction of the T-206 Wagner, stats, a 2-page baseball \\"tips\\" piece written by Wagner in 1950, and a short section that separates the book's facts from fiction.There's a minor romantic subplot that seemed a bit contrived, but it's incidental to the main action here. Wagner comes off as an admirable man with a wonderful sense of humor, and Gutman, as usual, shares with us his great affection for the game."},{"Title":"Honus and Me: A Baseball Card Adventure","review":"my 7 1/2 year old son (he's an above-grade reader) has read all five, and loved all of, dan gutman's baseball card books. i had the privilege of listening to one on tape -- this one, honus & me. it is well-told with great morality lessons and interesting historical information.

Possibly have a discussion with him about history or baseball? I would recommend to you &quot;Honus and Me.&quot; Although it is predictable, corny and slightly far-fetched, it was a fun read. The author researched the subject and era and tries to present historical information as accurately as possible (as a history teacher, thank you!), and even discussed his research at the end. The result, an adult/mentor is able to talk about the work a historian does (or even extend it to a talk on the scientific method) and use a subject that is usually not considered &quot;historically important&quot;, but is fun for boys--baseball.

Just like Joey, I practice baseball at least ten hours a week.This author, Dan Gutman, also writes a ton of other books. He writes Jackie and Me, Shoeless Joe and Me, and Honus and Me. He generally writes his books based on sports. If you like sports, I would definitely recommend this author. He writes his baseball books with a little bit of science fiction in them, which I really enjoy. Dan makes the reader get interested in the book right away. The author has convinced me to want to go back in time and become a teammate of Shoeless Joe Jackson.I recommend this book to anybody that has a dream of meeting a famous baseball player from the past. I enjoyed this book and I think that anybody that reads it will like it as well."},{"Title":"The Stock Market","review":"The title of the book suggests no bias or agenda for the work. It simply adopts the title of a very broad and complex area of commerce as it's own name; The Stock Market. The book offers a basic understanding of many aspects of the 'Market'in a way that the un-initiated can understand. Anyone looking for help in selecting a sure path to riches will be dissapointed. Anyone seeking an understanding of the basics, and how various aspects of the 'Market' relate to each other will be rewarded.This book deliveres knowledge and understanding without bias. It can serve as general reading material or as a reference. It prepares the reader to select and understand other material.New editions appear when the 'market' changes enough to warrant new material. The content is up to date without being padded by trendy but useless material.Cliff Critchettend of review comments"},{"Title":"The Stock Market","review":"Although this book is an introduction as well as a reference, some knowledge of stock market is assumed.

Perhaps this is because of a marketing failure on behalf of its publishers or perhaps it is due to a lack of reviewers pointing out the value it offers to a general audience. Whatever the case may be the fact remains that this book _is_ worth reading--by the professional attorney _and_ the average man or woman on the street. The purpose of my review here is to show, in essence, why._The Art of Cross-Examination_ teaches its readers how--meaning: by what methods--the truth can best be reached given conflicting stories or observations (whether they result from dishonesty, or from a failure to properly identify the truth).One of the things readers will learn from this book is how to--and when or when not to--ask the questions that will lead one to the truth, whatever that turns out to be in each case. You will learn the methods and the proper manner of cross-examination and then you'll learn how both of these apply in differing contexts (such as when cross-examining an expert or a perjured witness).As in all great non-fiction books Wellman presents what is being taught clearly, building in each chapter on what was learned in the previous one. More importantly, the author presents his case for how a proper cross-examination should be conducted by reference to numerous, often-humorous, and always-dramatic instances of successful cross-examinations. It is because of this, that an attorney young in years (if he or she reads this book carefully) may be experienced in knowledge well beyond his actual age. And this, I think, is the major reason why it has--quite properly--become a classic in the field of law.One example of the type of instances Wellman cites in his book ought to be sufficient to show how instructive _and memorable_ they can be. This particular instance is a humorous case where the author himself is cross-examining the witness. The suit was brought against the Metropolitan Street Railway after two of the company's electric cars collided. I will let the author, in his own words, explain the rest.\\"The plaintiff, a laboring man, had been thrown to the street pavement from the platform of the car by the force of the collision, and had dislocated his shoulder. He had testified in his own behalf that he had been permanently injured in so far as he had not been able to follow his usual employment for the reason that he could not raise his arm above a point parallel with his shoulder. Upon examination ... I asked the witness a few sympathetic questions about his sufferings, and upon getting on a friendly basis with him suggested that he be good enough to show the jury the extreme limit to which he could raise his arm since the accident. The plaintiff slowly and with considerable difficulty raised his arm to the parallel of his shoulder. 'Now, using the same arm, show the jury how high you could get it up before the accident,' was the next quiet suggestion; whereupon the witness extended his arm to its full height above his head, amid peals of laughter from the court and jury.\\"This example is but one of many. What it shows is, not just the value this book has for budding attorneys, but also its appeal to the general public. In many ways it offers the same value as do the numerous stories about dumb criminals that we hear almost daily on radio programs or in the newspapers. Yet, for my own part, this book is decidedly better--for its emphasis is not on the stupidity of common criminals but on the intelligence and skill of heroic lawyers._The Art of Cross-Examination_ is thus a book for those who want to see great minds at work (and discover what made their success possible). It is a book that entertains as much as it instructs--and because of this has appeal to those both within and outside of the specific audience for which it was written. In short, if you are intrigued by the drama of the courtroom or seek to one day take an active part in that drama, you will love this book.(Note: the book, however great, is not without faults--and I do not therefore endorse it unconditionally. The author makes some glaring errors in his descriptions of human nature that I cannot agree with and I do not subscribe to his belief that _absolute_ certainty is impossible to us as humans. These faults--and a few others of less grave consequence--detract from the overall value of the book but they do not mar its value too much. And thus, my enthusiastic recommendation of this book, albeit with this minor note of caution.)"},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"Back in 1973, when I rose to my hind legs to cross examine my first adverse witness in my first jury trial, I had but one thought on my mind: &quot;What do I do now?&quot; The answer came to me from a little paperback book I had picked up on a whim while I was in law school. Remembering a few of the teachings in that book, I struggled through that cross and several more en route to a favorable jury verdict.The first two years of my law practice, I read &quot;The Art of Cross Examination&quot; once every three months, and I profited from each re-reading. Wellman gives a wealth of basic practical advice, gives it in an engaging fashion, and illustrates it with entertaining stories. When you read it, you may find some gender references which we &quot;enlightened&quot; moderns would describe as &quot;politically incorrect,&quot; but try to remember that the book was written a century ago. Despite the fact that it's beginning to show its age a little, this book is THE classic commentary on cross examination. Nowhere else can you find such good instruction at such a low price.

He let me try the case, and we received a rather just decision from the court.

The first book I read was also the last- Wellman's The Art of Cross Examination.

What a disappointment. The book is obsolete and contains virtually nothing of any use to today's trial lawyer. It's a fun read, and it's interesting to see some of the examinations excerpted, but using this book to learn to cross-examine is probably close to malpractice.

Wellman, therefore, provides the reader with several examples of lawyers employing different styles of cross-examintion.In terms of learning the craft of cross-examination, the most valuable chapters deal with the examination of experts and in the examination of the \\"fallacies of testimony\\" and the \\"Silent Cross-Examination.\\"In reading Wellman's work, the reader must be cognizant of the fact that the book was written in 1903 and, as a result, realize that some of the \\"practical\\" advice may be outdated. Even so, there still may be value in that advice.In the end, the same thing was true in 1903 as it is today - the practice of law is really the art of borrowing and Wellman has provided much for the practitioner to borrow."},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"As soon as they're hired, each of my new associates always recieves this book as a gift.The reason for this is twofold. On the one hand this book, dating from more than a century ago, imparts the kindly sensibilities the practice of law once had (and really, should still have).On the other hand, this book is masterful in its treatment of the process of cross examining witnesses.Second in significance only to the selection of a jury, the process of cross examination is key to winning jury trials. This is because admissions tendered by the opposing party can eliminate disputed issues or focus attention on credibility problems.Though Wellman often goes into great detail in explaining his examples, it's been my experience that new attorneys to the field cannot help but benefit from such complete treatments.In this way, Wellman leads by example both in relation to his gentility and his prowess."},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"This is a book of a famous attorney who lived from the late 1800's to the l940's. His book is a description of his many court appearances and the value of cross-examination to discover truth and fraud. It is a must read for anyone who anticipates being on the witness stand, especially expert witinesses. It has great humor, but more importantly, describes the time proven methods of cross examination to bring out the truth. It demystifies the process and gives a human side to a mostly misunderstood and mistrusted activity. It also shows why cross examination is so very important.

The book has about 5 pages of good advice. Unfortunately, it is distributed across 450 pages of bloated reminiscenses by windbags who bored even their contemporaries to death with endless tales of their salad days in court. Sad. It's about as useful in modern litigation as a copy of Hammurabi's code, but not nearly as succinct.Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Nolo's Deposition Handbook, which has about 300 pages of good advice conveniently distributed over 300 pages of text."},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"Page 33 line 13, &quot;To be a great advocate, you must be a great actor&quot;.

It really is &quot;art&quot; in every sense of the word.Who else but a highly trained artist, is able to cross-examine a hostile witness, who also happens to be a veteran cop, in such a manner that the cop actually ends up helping secure an acquittal?

NO WAY!Bottom line, if you are a great lawyer wishing to become an excellent lawyer, this book is required reading. Nuff said!"},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"Any trial lawyer has heard of this book and many probably have it. That doesn't mean that they have read it. The reason for having the book is that it has been around so long--the author was a trial lawyer in the late 1800s--that everyone feels that they must have it. The reason they have not read it is because it is very difficult and seems so outdated. The practice of law has changed considerably since the late 1800s.Much of what Wellman has to say is not practical anymore and the cases he relies on have no real parrallels to litigation today. Even some of his techniques--no matter what the case--are now considered wrong. Think how much the practice of medicine has changed since the 1800s!One simple example that trial lawyers can relate to is that Wellman suggests that once you impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, you should then confront the witness and say, \\"Which statement is true?\\" He then instructs that you should keep arguing with the witness about which statement is true. Whether this was successful in the 1880s is impossible to know, but any good trial lawyer knows that it is an unsuccessful technique today.Having said all this, the book does provide a good historical account of trial practice and is worthy of reading if that is your goal."},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"While it is clear that Francis Wellman had tremendous success as a civil and criminal lawyer in the early 1900s, it is also clear that the advent of television, vis-a-vis- The Practice, Law and Order, etc, along with hundreds of movies filmed inside the courtroom, have outdated this book.As stated in another review, the advice about actual technique offered in this book is sparce while the recollections of Mr. Wellman's trial days fill the pages, unnecessarily. While reading these examples of cross-examination, it becomes almost laughable how Mr. Wellman prides himself on how he beat various witnesses in ways that if were on television today would not be renewed for a second season for lack of creativity.In the first example of an \\"expert\\" cross-examination, Mr. Wellman recalls the cross of a witness who the attorney attempts to prove is lying. The \\"zinger\\", after three pages of cross, is the attorney finally showing the witness a letter disproving his testimony (wow?). In fact, in the next few hundred pages, most of the crosses referenced are merely endless tesimony culminating with a piece of documetary evidence, like an almanac, picture, or treastise, that finally questions the credibility of the witness.While this method of cross-examination may have been revolutionary in 1900, today with the availability of witness information from infinite sources, and the public recognition of litigators whose crosses include more than attacking credibility, his book reads as antiquated and boring."},{"Title":"The art of cross-examination,","review":"An outstanding book with excellent examples of the use of cross-examinations.

Wellman explains techniques to elicit answers in the most revealing way in a courtroom environment. However, anyone who has a large staff or who sells for a living, gathering information from others in order to make decisions, can benefit from this book.In essence, Wellman is relying on a timeless and useful concept: \\"show, don't tell.\\" Use your questions to elicit a response, not to bludgeon or to make your own point. The answers of others will more effectively make your point better than you can make it yourself. Also, asking the right questions will yield surprising information. For sales people, proper questions gets at the real reasons for customer resistance.One of the maxims of negotiation is that people change their mind while talking. Thus, these techniques are helpful when you are trying to convince or influence some one in a negotiation. Proper, non-accusatory questioning allows the other side to justify changes in their positions that is beneficial for you as well. Also, it helps you figure out why they are taking certain positions, which leads to more win-win opportunities.I read once that thinking is actual a series of questions asked to yourself. As a result, this book will also help you think. Ask yourself better questions, and you will get a better quality of thought.Also, if you have kids this book can be helpful (especially Chapter 4, 'Cross Examination of the Perjured Witness'). Calmly probing what you suspect to be a fabricated story is much more effective than yelling or accusing.

I first came across this paperback in Law School during mock trials, and have come to rely upon it many, many times especially at preliminary hearings.Although dated (first edition 1903), the author quotes extensively from memorable cases and utilizes them to illustrate both the manner and matter of cross-examination. Wellman covers the topics of handling perjured witness and the expert, and the importance of sequence and the importance of paying attention to the nature of the psychology of the witness.The aspect of Wellman showing how, and knowing when, to illicit information from the witness is why this book has become famous.Wellman uses many famous (at the time) cases that are very humorous, and also timeless (marital discord in 1903 is marital discord in 2004, for example).

For three days the Ukrainian community celebrates to the sound of bells and to the singing of spring songs--vesnianky. At Easter, the greeting and response are Khrystos Voskres! (Christ is Risen!) and Voistynu Voskres! (Indeed, He has Risen!). Just as the crocus is a herald of spring, the pussy willow is a harbinger of Easter for Ukrainians worldwide and is synonymous with this holy day.The cover color photo of \`Ukrainian Easter: Traditions, Folk Customs, and Recipes' depicts a tabletop with a Ukrainian embroidered rushnyk (ritual ceremonial cloth--see paragraph below this one for further details) with the words Khrystos Voskres! (Christ is Risen!), pussy willows, daffodils, and a sample of traditional Ukrainian Easter foods which are blessed in church on Holy Saturday and eaten on Easter Sunday. The blessed Easter foods include: paska, babka, meats, cheese, butter, eggs, horseradish, and salt.A further note about the rushnyk (Ukrainian plural is rushnyky): it's a ritual ceremonial cloth. As The Ukrainian Museum in NYC states on its website: \\"rushnyky (ritual cloths). The ritual cloths have a long history in the Ukrainian folk art tradition, dating back to pagan times. These textiles, as well as their designs are deeply symbolic. While most of the symbolism and magic surrounding their meaning has been lost with time, nevertheless enough information has been passed down through the centuries for people to still utilize rushnyky even today in various religious ceremonies and passage of life rituals.\\"R.

Unfortunately too many men and women who serve our country as heroes every day and put their lives on the line get tossed aside by the bureaucracy after they are needed. The pain and suffering that our own government puts these families through is unexcusable at best and evil otherwise. Michael and Denise should be commended for their courage in telling this all too real story. It made me laugh and cry throughout, much like life does. All of us can feel this story, it could be any of us. A must read."},{"Title":"Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir","review":"I first came across the book in the fall of '99. It was at a critical time in my air force career. Soon, the mandate to submit to the anthrax vaccine would require a decision that would obviously affect the rest of my life. Take a vaccine that has been proven to cause terrible reactions and has been whispered to be a root cause of Gulf War Illness or refuse and be subject to military justice and the end of my career.In my squadron, the most asked question to management was &quot;If we become ill following the vaccine, will the Air Force take care of us?&quot; As I saw in this book, the answer to the question is NO.As pilots, our most treasured asset is our health. Without it, we can no longer perform the mission that we love. The manner in which Michael and Denise describe the physical and mental anguish he endured was truly overwhelming. I could imagine myself in his position and the way I would react; how I would feel.In my months of research, this book proved to be one of the many determining factors in my decsion. When I talked to former commanders who reminded me of their experiences with Agent Orange or when I spoke with members at my own base that had testified to Congress about their illnesses following the anthrax vaccine, in the back of my mind was Michael Donnelly.I ultimately made my decision to resign in lieu of taking the vaccine which has led to the end of my aviation career. The only salvation I have is the knowledge that I will never need to worry about unexplained illness in the future.My most heartfelt sympathy and gratitude go out to Michael and Denise's families. Michael's story is one that I will never forget. Thank you for helping me make my decision."},{"Title":"Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir","review":"I obtained a tape of this book from the library of the blind , on tape.I was fascinated with the whole process of his student days as well as the way they worked in the present time illness.My heart goes out to him and his family and ALL other Soldiers who became ill with no apparent cause after the war.I would like to know what his present status is, and would like to help in any way that is possible.In thinking that our present war situation probably is as tentative, to hold this VITAL information back from those who serve makes a mockery of the Ideals our Country was founded on.I used to participate in Living History, and the good thing about that is that we seem to LEARN from the past.War does NOT change minds or hearts.I would hope and pray that this present generation does not have to pay the price of this brave Soldier, Officer, and Gentleman."},{"Title":"Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir","review":"Around the time that Generals Powell and Schwarkopf were being feted in the United States as the most conspicuous heroes of the Persian Gulf War, Major Donnelly returned home to an equally jubilant but more modest reception. He had flown more than forty bombing missions during the conflict and emerged unscathed. But coiled tightly within him on his return home was a war related affliction -- amyotropic later sclerosis or ALS, better known as Lou Gherig's disease -- that gradually stripped him of his mobility, leaving his body immobilized, while his mind and senses remained unimpaired and sharp as a tack. Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir is an action packed memoir of the gulf war told from an F16 pilot's point of view, a record of Major Donnelly's tragic deterioration, and a partial account of his valient and ultimately successful effort to persuade men without chests in the Pentagon that there is indeeed a well founded connection between the illnesses suffered by more than 160,000 returning troops and their service in the gulf. Only recently, under much pressure brought by gulf war veterans, Major Donnelly among them, has congress passed a law that would presume gulf war illnesses are related to hazardous wartime exposures, thus ending the agonizing battle fought by sick vets to obtain medical relief for illnesses they suffered in the service of their country. When the subject is flying, Major Donnelly prose takes wing and ascends to poetry. At its best, some passages remind me of St. Exupery's writings on flight. The narrative includes sharp profiles of his comrades in arms, and his story is told with the kind of mildly exaggerated humor that flowed so effortlessly from the pen of Mark Twain. In the last few pages of his book, Major Donnelly aims his sights at officials who towed the Pentagon's line on Gulf War Syndrome. The assault will be particualrly gratifying to true patriots. Unfortunately for Major Donnelly and his courageous family, there can be no happy ending to his story. But his book is itself a record of a man fully alive who has battled valiantly for others and, as such, it represents a great victory of love and the human spirit over fear and death."},{"Title":"Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir","review":"I just found out about Michael's death through the Gulflink website.

Major Donnelly is an inspiration to us all, and now inspires us to the reality of our system.As a former military officer, I feel the same sense of loss that Major Donnely describes so tactfully in this book. This loss comes at a time when our president, the Commander in Chief, no longer maintains the same standards of conduct which is expected from any member of the military. This loss of integrity and honor among military leaders, government bureacrats, and politicians is unacceptable. The events which led to the writing of this excellent book were avoidable, as is the eventual fate of this country if we don't address this problem now.Thankfully, I served with the Marine Corps.

He discusses a wide variety of problems, such as political, economic, cultural, social and theological; while attempting to state who the teachings of Islam are related to them. An extremely productive writer, who produced more than 120 books, A'la Mawdudi is known for his tenacious adherence to his ideas regardless how much controversy they may arise. On a world as controversial as the Islamic one, this trait just oozes character, and who can resist that?This book was given to me as a present when I expressed an interest in Islam. Personal reasons aside, I dare say that no one can deny the logic that exists in its doctrine. Once we're pass the \\"hijab\\" or head-dress for women as a way of subjugation, the separation that exists between them and men in public -unless they are related, the fact that it \\"just happens\\" to be the religion of the terrorists from 9/11, as well as the one from the \\"uncultured\\" people of the desert, etc.; we can finally allow ourselves to come to the realization that what is revealed in The Holy Qu'ran just has to be true, simply because it makes absolute, logical sense. And, just like Aristotle would more or less say, the human mind tends to accept naturally whatever is logical.Thus, the book exposes the firm belief in the existence of the one true God, a necessary source to keep men from using their own resources or talents against each other. This was revealed through the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW); an illiterate man with a heart of gold, the patience of a saint and a soul as pure as that of a child. \\"He was the one whose example and teachings inspired the thoughts of the oneness of mankind, the equality of the human race, the concepts of true democracy and real freedom in the world.\\" (Page 63) Try that for those who qualify Islam as a religion solely based on Fundamentalism. The two final chapters on Islamic Law, Jurisprudence and Mysticism - although concise, provide a wealth of information about how the moral system of Islam works and what its bases are. They refer not just to individual but moral conduct of men, women, family and community.I found the work a good bedrock to go on the hunt for more. I would recommend to anyone either interested in learning about Islam or taking it up as his or her religion, to first read this book before reading the Holy Qu'ran. It would give you a full, rounded picture of what to expect and what it is all about.Should this be your first book about Islam? Not necessarily. Should it be your last? Most likely not. It should, however, be one you read at some point. And mark it down, because you'll keep referring to it as a source for discussion further discussion."},{"Title":"Towards Understanding Islam","review":"An absolutely refreshing and modern explanation of Islamic ideals and fundamentals. The author is an amazing scholar with wide scopes. He focuses on making Islam relevant to the world of today, and does accomplish the goal. An excellent book for Muslims, new or old, and non-Muslims alike."},{"Title":"Towards Understanding Islam","review":"This book is a rational and logical explanation which appeals to all Muslims and non-Muslims alike due to its simplicity and authenticity. It is a wonderfully erudite and simple book that is a great value for anybody who needs to understand the true meaning of Islam."},{"Title":"Towards Understanding Islam","review":"Although several sections of the book are spiritually uplifting some Ulama, who deeply respect the author, caution that, \\"one should be weary of the sections on belief and disbelief in Towards Understanding Islam as they do not reflect the positions taken by the majority of reliable Muslim scholars throughout history.The authors of such works have taken \\"extreme\\" positions because they have a specific purpose. They are not writing for 21st century Muslim minorities in America, but for a mid-twentieth century Muslim society struggling against secular represession and corruption (1).\\" This fatwa on the book was given by Sulma Badrudduja at Sunnipath.(1) Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad, Tradition or Extradition"},{"Title":"Towards Understanding Islam","review":"I am not a hater of Islam, per se, but the previous reviewer has obviously never taken a course in logic. Mawdudi's writing is extremely repetitive, as are all religious texts. Mawdudi believes Islam is the \\"natural religion\\" that everything follows even if it doesn't call itself Muslim, because according to Mawdudi, Islam is submitting oneself to the order of the universe, and the universe is supremely ordered and perfect. Hey Mawdudi, guess what, the universe is a hell-hole. Where are you living, dude?"},{"Title":"Elements of Reasoning","review":"Munson and Conway do a very fine job in this little text, introducing the subject matter of logic with enough detail to get you started. There are, of course, lots of textbooks out there that go into lots more detail. But this one is about right if you want to pick it up and cover the basics on your own. You learn what an argument is and how to recognize them and analyze them, what the basic types of arguments are (deductive and inductive) and how they differ and how to assess each type for its success as an inductive argument and for its validity as a deductive argument. There is coverage of basic propositional logic and proofs, and coverage of categorical syllogisms and Venn diagrams. There are chapters on fallacies (though I have a minor quibble with them on which fallacies to include in an intro text, the chapter does give a good overview), on probabilistic reasoning, on causal reasoning, and on writing logically.I assign this one as a basic text in my introduction to logic course -- largely because I can't see the point of assigning a big textbook that will cost them $90 when this one covers what I need, and I can supplement it with other materials of my own choosing. One advantage you would get from some of the more expensive texts (e.g. Hurley or Copi's introductory textbooks) is access to a computer based program that can guide you through problems. Otherwise, in terms of coverage and clarity, this text works quite well."},{"Title":"Elements of Reasoning","review":"While this book presents standard forms of logic, it real strength lies in its application to everyday common sense, logic.

This book was published in 1965, barely pre-dating the publication of Venturi's influential \\"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture.\\" Now that I've read both, if I had to recommend one, I would recommend Peter Collins. While Venturi attacks Modernism by simply saying \\"its not complicated enough, I like complex architecture (and therefore you should too)\\" Collins goes much, much more in-depth.The various ideas architects have desperately flung around since 1750 are all traced, dissected, and put into their social contexts. Rationalism, Romanticism, Ecclecticism, Historicism/Archeology, Classics versus Goths, the Moderns, the various analogies to other fields architects have attempted - it is all discussed. The book stops at 1950, but this does not detract from its relevance in 2004, as we can see that architects have continued to explore connections with other genres in order to create their various forms. It is important to realize what we're doing and if it has ever be done before - and - it all pretty much has been. Not to despair though, Collins keeps it an interesting read, if you do not chuckle at his wit every now and then, then your sense of humor is dead. It is important to read this critically, and I found myself only very occasionally disagreeing.One of my favorite chapters, which is almost a six-page long joke, is entitled \\"Architecture and Gastronomy.\\" (and yet - it is not a joke!)The only criticism of the book is perhaps his less-intensive use of illustrations than he might have. Those that he does include however are well-chosen.A very closely related work to this is J. Mordaunt Crook's 1987 \\"The Dilemma of Style: Architectural Ideas from the Picturesque to the Post Modern.\\" Crook makes a book that attempts to do essentially the same thing, but has a slightly diferent perspective. I mention it because I believe these two, Crook and Collins, should be read by any architect worth their salt.Kenneth Frampton writes a fairly interesting introduction to the 1998 edition, hopefully this book will continue to have stamina for future generations of architects."},{"Title":"Tomorrow and Tomorrow","review":"COULD HE HOLD THE WORLD TOGETHER?The Vikes were in the saddle riding high - peddling forbidden pleasures, substituting drugs for cocktails, following a twisted path which would permit mankind to escape reality.

My test taking and math skills were pretty rusty. I want to get into a top 20 MBA program to make it worth the investment. Consequently a great score was very important. I was shooting for 700.I bought the Princeton book / CD, the Kaplan book / CD, and the Official Guide from ETS. I also downloaded the PowerPrep software from ETS for free. I completely exhausted the Princeton and Kaplan material - test strategies, exercises, practice tests. I did all the practice tests in PowerPrep. Moreover, I did the last third of the questions from the Official Guide (the harder questions are in the back).I did not take a training class. I took a Kaplan class 14 years ago for the LSAT and was not happy with the investment. Better would be to find a study partner in your area.My assessment:1. The Princeton book by far has the better explanations of test taking strategies, as compared to Kaplan.2. The Princeton questions are much more similar in structure to the real GMAT questions, as compared to Kaplan.3. The verbal sections of Princeton practice tests are pretty similar in terms of difficulty to the real GMAT verbal section, as compared to Kaplan.4. The quantitative section of the real GMAT is far more difficult than Princeton practice tests.5. The Kaplan practice tests are much harder than the real GMAT.6. The free online tests that come with the Princeton book / CD are a great added bonus.7. The PowerPrep software is identical in look and feel to the real GMAT, but the quant questions are definitely easier.8. The Princeton book has the best approach to the writing sections, but do review the Kaplan material as well.If you want a top score then my advice is to get all three books and download PowerPrep. You also need a lot of time to prepare, particularly if you're working full time or if you've been out of college for a while. I studied and practiced for about 8 weeks. You also need to be comfortable with taking the test on a computer. It is more difficult than on paper - harder to read on the screen, harder to take notes, etc.First, start with the Princeton book - this will give you a solid foundation. Next, exhaust the PowerPrep software. This will give you a good baseline of where you are and where you need to focus. (I scored 730 and 740 w/ the PowerPrep software.)Next tackle the Kaplan book, but only focus on sections where you are having trouble. Then exhaust the Princeton Software. (I scored 720 and 730 on the practice tests on Princeton's CD.)Then do the Kaplan CD practice exercises and practice tests. The tests are very hard, more difficult than the GMAT . . . particularly the verbal. You will score lower on these tests. The practice exercises don't give you enough time to answer all of the questions. Nevertheless, try not to become too frustrated. Keep in mind that you are building stamina and you are improving by seeing new, challenging quant questions. (I scored 640 on the diagnostic, and 680, 580, 650, 600 on the Kaplan CD practice tests, much lower than Princeton and PowerPrep.)When you're finished w/ the Kaplan CD, start doing the last 1/3 or so of each section in the Official Guide, 20 questions at a time. These are ACTUAL GMAT questions. The explanations are EXCELLENT, far better than either Kaplan or Princeton. Unfortunately some Official Guide questions are repeated from the PowerPrep software.Meanwhile, mix in online practice tests from Princeton; again you'll have seen some questions before. Don't sweat the recycled material. You won't remember the answers to many of them and you'll have to rework the quant questions anyway. At this point it is more important to understand why you are missing certain types of questions repeatedly and to improve how you attack specific question types. (I scored 750, 710, 690, 730 on the Princeton online practice tests. However, these scores are suspect due to the recycled questions.)My advice is to take NO tests the day before the GMAT. Clear your head some. Spend time getting comfortable with a template for the writing section. Review specific questions that you've missed in the past - the Official Guide is ideal for this - understanding the correct approach. Relax if you can and get a good night's sleep.Last piece of advice, bring a snack and use ALL of BOTH breaks. Stand up, stretch, whiz, drink something, eat something. The test is exhausting and you need to use the breaks to clear your head and refocus.If you do all this you should get a great score. The real GMAT was VERY difficult, even after all of my preparation. I even guessed on a few quant questions that I had no idea how to attack. The whole test went by in a blur. Stamina and timing, however, were not an issue with so much full-length practice.I ended up with a 760, far better than I targeted and expected, even better than on any practice test I took. This was a pleasant surprise, given how difficult the test was as compared to much of the practice material. However, by using all of the practice material effectively I am now able to look at top 10 programs instead of top 20! Yeah!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"The most important thing to know about this book is that the practice tests are MUCH HARDER than the actual GMAT. I initially took the diagnostic on the software and got a 680. Encouraged, I went through the software program for a couple of weeks and then decided to take a practice test. Got a 550 and it really freaked me out. I'd like to go to a top school, and a 550 isn't even in the ballpark. I really don't know if Kaplan makes their tests so hard on purpose to scare people into registering for a course, but it almost worked on me.Instead though, I purchased several other books. Without a doubt, the best one for prep is the \\"Official Guide\\". The tests that you get when you register (or from MBA.com) are the best indicators of what you'll actually score. The Princeton review tests seemed much easier than the Kaplan tests (though they proved much more accurate), and the material in that book isn't that great - with the key exception of the writing part. They basically tell you exactly what to do to get a good score - follow their advice, it works.I also got the Kaplan GMAT 800 book. Not great, but not bad. There aren't enough practice problems in this book. You'll do better just practicing the Official Guide problems at the BACK of each section. Make sure that you do the last 100 problems in each section, which are much harder than those at the beginning of each section.Overall this is how I scored on the practice tests, and on the GMAT (so that you can get an idea of how the practice tests compare)Kaplan: 550, 610, 680Princeton: 720, 7402 downloadable tests: 720, 760Actual GMAT: 740In conclusion, while the Kaplan tests report low scores that do not reflect your likely performance on the GMAT, they also serve as good practice. Buy this book, the Official Guide, and the Princeton Review Verbal Workout (for the writing section)."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I'm a GMAT tutor with 15+ years of successful students behind me. Here's what I suggest for the GMAT:1. Use the Kaplan CD (as cheesy as the presentation is, the tests are very good). I've read the complaints below that the prep tests from Kaplan are too hard, and I have to disagree with the point being made by these students. The only way, on a computer-adaptive test, to increase your score is to test using HARDER, not easier problems. I may kick ass at medium level questions, but unless I want a medium level score, practicing at a lower level hurts rather than helps.2. Ignore the Kaplan book. Use The Princeton Review books (either Cracking the GMAT or GMAT Workouts for Math and Verbal) for tricks and psychology. Try the Official Guide for extra problems and basic review issues (but use as much of the Princeton psychology as you can -- the official guide encourages you to do the problems straight, and that's a huge waste of time).3. Take as many practice tests as you can. That means Kaplan, Princeton Review, PowerPrep. Barrons, Petersons, and Dummies are all awful. Don't bother with their instruction or their tests.4. Check out your local library. Many public libraries have crazy collections of old, out of print Official Guides, chock full o paper-and-pencil tests going back a good 20 years. By all means, use these -- they're a goldmine of practice questions.Good luck!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I bought this book, the Arco Master the Gmat Cat 2004 book, the Offical GMAT Review book, and the Princeton review book (ok, I went a little crazy on the book buying). To be honest, I didn't even crack open the book and just used the CD. The CD was great, it has tutorials on anything and will create a custom study plan based on your diagnostic test. The CD tutorials are probably slower than using the book, but they provide a good overview and have the benefit of preventing you from missing some things that you might ignore in the book. Additionally, they perhaps make the process of studying a little more fun.You can view this as a negative or a positive, but I found the adaptive practice tests on the CD much harder than the PowerPrep tests provided by GMAT or those provided by the other books. On the quantitative section I found myself really pressed for time. Since so much of the GMAT is pacing, the difficulty of these tests can help you learn to work faster, on the downside, they might make you think you have to work faster than you actually do on the real test. My best score on a practice test using this CD was 680. My best score was 770 using the PowerPrep GMAT software, 720 using the Princeton software, and 750 on the actual GMAT.So, as long as you realize that you'll probably do a little better than the Kaplan tests indicate and you at least try the free PowerPrep tests to get a better feel for actual pacing, I think this book is a good bet.If you were only going to buy one book, I'd recommend the official GMAT review book, then the Kaplan, then the Princeton, and then the ARCO."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I am rather suprised at the low overall customer-review rating of this book. I used a combination of online sample tests, the Kaplan book, the Princeton Review and ETS study guides. Of these resources, I feel the Kaplan more closely replicated the questions on the actual GMAT. My score from taking the Kaplan book's exams were consistently within 10 points of my actual score, proving there is incredible similarity between Kaplan's questions and ETS'. The Princeton Review book has reasonable sample questions as well, but explanation as how to arrive at an answer simply don't make a lot of sense. The study CD ETS mails out once you signed up for the test is just incredibly too easy. I steadily scored 700+ every time I took an ETS sample test... my actual was nearly 100 points less. :(The GMAT test knowledge you've built over the years; in reality there's little you can do to significantly increase your score, but you do stand a better chance of feeling prepared by using using these guides. In the end, the Kaplan book was the highest-quality study material on the market."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I am writing to echo the comments by earlier readers. I recently studied for the GMAT, and used Princeton Review (GMAT and Verbal workout), Kaplan, and the ETS official guide book (plus PowerPrep CD). Here is how I did:- studied Princeton Review and Kaplan books. Midway through, tried 1st Kaplan prep test: got 640. Not good.- finished PR and Kaplan, tried 1st PowerPrep test: 720. Felt better.- studied ETS Guide, half way through, tried 2st PowerPrep: 760. Much better. But ran into many of same questions as in ETS book- finished ETS guide, done studying (and sick of it), tried 2nd Kaplan test: still 640... Threw the CD in the garbage can.- Actual exam, 2 months into studying: 740.I recommend that you finish all exercises in the ETS book, the last math exercises are hard and resemble more what you get on the actual test. Also, practice speed reading, because you'll need it during actual Verbal test.Use Kaplan book to prepare for exam, their CD is useless and discouraging."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Personally, I think it is the best book out there today. Loved the 2001 edition: it had nice paper - white and thick, very nice for side notes. The book was very well organized and quite condenced - 350 pages. At the end it has a powerful Math review with the most useful formulae; that was one of my favorite sections.The Software is also the best of what I have seen: it is easy to use, helpful, interactive, and funny, which was very helpful to me in those cold winter nights as I was crunching math and verbal. There are about 4 tests on the CD, but you can really take them 6 or 8 times and still see new questions. (maybe my memory is bad?).NOTE: The Tests that are on the CD are not scored the same way as the Official GMAT; you will be about 100 points off (below) from your final GMAT score, so do not let this fact distress you.CD includes 4 full length practice tests, 9 verbal practice tests, 15 math review lessons, 9 math practice tests, quizes, a games, and a great fun interface.Book Score: 5/5Test Simulator: 4/5 (not representative, but tough is good).--Bogdan"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I just took the GMAT and want to share my experience. Hopefully my advice can be helpful to those of you out there who need to prepare for the GMAT.I'm not a native speaker of English and have never taken a standardized test before in my life; yet I scored a 770 on the GMAT in my first try. I owe quite a bit of that score to the Kaplan book - although I never followed their course (or anyone elses for that matter).The Kaplan book is good, but it's the CD rom that's really worth your time. If you follow the quizzes and test exams on the CD rom you'll be in great shape for the actual GMAT.I started out with Arco's 24-hour course. Arco's book is great, and it has quite a bit more stuff on the math and verbal part than Kaplan has. On the other hand, it's still only a book - I didn't get any CD with it.Then I went on to tackle the official guide from ETS. Anyone who wants to prepare for the GMAT should work some of the problems in this book. I did them all, but I don't really think that's neccesary -- just do the final third in each section and you'll be fine.Finally I read the Kaplan book. There was not much in the book that I didn't already know. In fact, Kaplan has much less material than Arco. However, when you start working with Kaplan's CD rom you realize how much info is packed on that disk. There's 18 quizzes with 9 math and 9 verbal and they're all great practice. They actually force you to work *faster* than you'll need for the real test. Also, there are very few errors in the Kaplan material, and their problems come very close to the real ones.I took the four GMAT CATs on the CD rom and got 700, 780, 660 and 700. There's no question that Kaplan artificially lower your score so you're guaranteed to score higher on the real test, but that's cool as long as it doesn't discourage you. Just know that's the way it is.I also took the PowerPrep tests, just for practice... but I had already done the problems in the ETS book ! However you should definitely work with PowerPrep to get a sense of the problems and the way they're presented.Hope this helps. Good luck !!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"This is the first (and probably only) time I will review a book on Amazon. But I promised myself I would do a review after taking my GMAT because the advice of others who have posted their reviews before me were very helpful to me and I wanted to add my experience so it would hopefully help others.My experience with the Kaplan book is a familiar one if you read other reviews on this site (either reviews on this 2004 Kaplan book or on previous GMAT Kaplan books from 2003, etc.). I mainly focused on using the CD-ROM. The CD may seem a little juvenile at times in its presentation but the lessons and the strategies it gives you are helpful. The book mainly gives you the same stuff you'll get on the CD so I mainly skimmed through the book. However, I did like the book's advice on how to ready yourself for the GMAT in the final week.The best piece of advice I can give anybody is when you take the practice tests on the Kaplan CD, DO NOT get discouraged if your scores are lower than you would like. As others have stated, the Kaplan tests are clearly harder than the actual GMAT. If I had not read the reviews of this book on Amazon, I may have never taken the actual test because I was very discouraged by my Kaplan test scores. I understand Kaplan probably wants to make it more difficult so you study harder (and then they can in some fashion take credit for preparing you) but I think they should say something that allows the reader to know that they are getting questions that are generally more difficult than most questions on the actual test.I don't recall exactly what scores I received on Kaplan's CD-ROM tests but I do recall that my highest score on any of them was a 550. To show you how incorrect of a predictor the Kaplan tests are, I scored well over 100 points HIGHER than 550 on my actual GMAT test (I took the actual test on Nov. 21st).Though I think Kaplan is a helpful supplement to use in preparing for the GMAT, I would highly recommend downloading the two free practice tests through MBA.com to get an accurate idea of where you stand. Maybe take one of the two tests right away and see where you are at before you get down to studying. Then maybe save the other practice test for the final week or so before your real GMAT exam.The two downloadable tests are by far the best at honing in on what your actual test score may look like. I would also recommend using the ETS official guide book that you can buy through MBA.com because it has loads of good practice questions (just a warning, some of the questions in the official guide book are repeated in the two downloadable tests).In summary, Kaplan helped me but I got a lot more out of the resources from MBA.com. As long as you don't let Kaplan discourage you, you should be fine. The actual GMAT test is not as bad as you may think and you can do well with some quality study time and doing practice problems. I did MUCH better than Kaplan would predict and I am very happy about it. Good luck on your test and try to pass on your experience to help others once you are done!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"The material of the book is of a tough level and should be only done for practice. I scored 620, 630, 640 and 700 on the Kaplan tests and 740 on the real test. The good thing about Kaplan is that the questions are real tough and one has to master these tough questions to get a high score. The bad part is that the low scores a person gets can lower ones confidence. Good thing that I had read reviews after taking few of the tests and that had made me feel better...Overall the ETS book is the closest to the real GMAT although the tests in ETS are somewhat simpler....I had taken those tests too long back and had scored 690, 710 so dont really bother....another piece of advise - on the real day take the questions one by one no matter how u think u r performing....i had thought i had screwed my exam big time and was expecting a 660-670 when i actually saw 740...there are a lot of experimental questions and the better u r doing the more the chances that the experimental questions would be having ambigous answers...All the best!!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"After being out of school for over 20 years, I decided to take the advice offered on this page in order to focus my preparation. I only used two study aids -- PowerPrep & this book. Like the other reviewers, I found the most value from the CD with its practice tests and explanations of correct answers. The CD lessons and book were marginal.Over the course of three weeks, I tried to take a balanced approach by taking only two mini (category-based) tests an evening. On the weekends, I would take a simulated GMAT. As noted in the other reviews, these tests are far more challenging than the PowerPrep test. I had to keep reminding myself of that in order not to get too discouraged. I took the test today and the extra effort was rewarded with a 710."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I bought this book because of the great reviews here. It has turned out be a disappointment.I took the GMAT in 1997. I studied with the Princeton Review \\"Beating the GMAT\\" and got a 690. I don't remember liking that book all that much so I expected more from this one. After all, this book includes \\"proven test taking strategies\\" from their $1,000 class...However I found very little of use in this book. Most of the book is either a) facts about the GMAT that are freely available or b) basic standardized test techniques that you should have learned for the SAT. Such memorable advice as \\"Make sure you understand the directions\\" and \\"Choose an answer\\"...I did find the 100 math tips to be very helpful, which means that I found 26 of the 352 pages to be helpful.I have not looked at the CD. Perhaps that is helpful? For now I will focus on the study guide from the ETS itself. That book provides actual test questions with explanations.So if a book costs $37 and has 352 pages but only 26 pages are useful, what should the price P of the book be?"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I'm bothering to write this review because I'm frustrated. This CDROM (to be fair I barely opened the book) should be great. I found the lessons to be well written and useful, despite the annoying and childish graphics and animations. I also found the mechanics of the test function to be great, with the computer keeping track of both how you changed your answers and which questions you spent your time on. The problem is the questions themselves.The practice tests are a key element, and the questions are poorly written. Some questions have typographical errors and misspellings, others have logic errors. I got one of the math questions wrong because I hadn't considered the possibility that variable x was irrational, despite the fact that the official GMAT instructions clearly state that all numbers are real.I found the free downloadable PowerPrep software from ETS to have much more useful sample tests. The PowerPrep software includes real GMAT questions. I certainly didn't get every question right when I took the tests, but to my relief I agreed with their logic in explaining why my answers were wrong. This was in marked contrast to Kaplan.I still give Kaplan 3 stars out of 5 for the useful lessons. I believe that working through this material probably increased my score by 50 points. But if I were to do it again I would consider skipping Kaplan's tests altogether."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"This book really adds very little to the information already dispened in the official GMAT guide. The CD is particularly bad. The animation is cheesy, slow and annoying and the content is quite removed from the content on actual exams. In the answers to many of the CAT exams presented on the CD, the author will advise you that your time is better spent &quot;going back and reviewing the answers you provided to previous question&quot; which is quite contrary to the nature of GMAT CAT exams where you are not able to go back to a question once a final answer is confirmed.There are some useful tricks and shortcuts on the CD, so definitely go ahead and purchase it, but this should only be used as supplemental material and not as your main study guide."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I bought this book because my friends recommended it to me and after studying this book for few weeks, I found the ways which kaplan present their materials is not bad, however, I think Princeton does a better job. The real disappointment is the CD that comes with this book.This CD is absolutely useless. The practice exams on the CD is very very misleading and discouraging. I find their Math questions is extremely misleading. I wrote many practice exams from different sources: Kaplan, Princeton, ETS and score800. My math score from Princeton, ETS, and score800 were fairly consistent, around 45-47. However, with Kaplan, I only got a 36. I also find some of the answers on the verbal section are incorrect as well. As for the overall score on the exam (math + verbal), I scored only 550 with Kaplan but much much higher with other ones.My recommendation is that do not buy this book unless you have read all other gmat guides and find them not very helpful. The materials covered in this book can be found in any gmat study guides (Princeton, ETS etc.). The only section I found useful from this book is the math reference section.The books that I would recommend include:- Princeton GMAT Review 2004- Verbal Workout for the GMAT (Princeton Review)- The Official Guide for GMAT Review (ETS)Good luck to you all...."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Along with the other reviewers, I used this book along with other resources to study for the GMAT and I ended up scoring a 730. Overall, I highly recommend reading this book, following the CD tutorial, and then taking as many practice questions in the Official Guide as possible.I did not take a class because my work schedule would not allow it, so my score is entirely based on self study. But I did go through this book, the CD, and Kaplan Verbal Workbook, the Princeton Review, and the Official Guide. All of which were valuable, but I think the most helpful part of my studying was reading through the Kaplan guide to pick up their tips for dealing with questions and then applying the tips to real problems from the Official Guide.As far as my score history goes, I scored a 590 on the diagnostic, a 550 on my first Kaplan test. I then took an ETS practice test and got a 660. I took the GMAT once and got a 660. Disappointed, I reviewed the material and studied a few hours more, and then took the test again and I scored a 730.Each of the books has value, but I like the Kaplan book better than the Princeton book basically because of differing approaches to the test. Kaplan focuses on helping you solve questions quickly and effectively and guessing if you have to. Princeton helps you figure out how hard a problem is (which is impossible in the real test) and then guess effectively. For me the Kaplan was a much better book overall.Many people complain that the Kaplan tests are too hard, but if you plan to score well you need to be able to complete difficult problems in a short period of time. Practicing hard questions doesn't hurt, as long as you keep you confidence up. GOOD LUCK!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"The 2004 Princeton review book has MUCH better tips and tricks for taking the GMAT. Their review is more in-depth and straightforward than the Kaplan book. I went through the Kaplan book first and often found it confusing or not going far enough with their explanations. Then, I went through the Princeton book and was surprised at how everything seemed much more useful. The CD in the Kaplan book is nice because it helps you to get your timing on questions down, but overall, the Princeton book is much better."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I found this book highly disappointing. The review sections are over simplified. To find an answer to the multiple choice questions - you must read through 2 paragraphs of comments and you still are unable to determine what the author is saying is the correct answer. The CD-Rom is a bigger joke - a games section which completely makes no sense and the multiple choice questions never provide you with an answer.I have studied for the CPA exam using self study guides, which allowed me to pass all 4 sections in one sitting. Using Kaplan's review for the GMAT - I think I would definitely come up short."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I got this book solely for the 4 CAT tests as I knew that Princeton and the Official Guide are the best for theory, strategies, and exercises.The CD was horrible. On 2 of the tests it gave me 30 minutes for one of the sections instead of 75 (it starts with 75 and then on question 6 you are left with 20 minutes having worked for 5-10 minutes!One of the tests ran OK but it didn't save my answers, so I couldn't come back and review it!Finally when I started the 4th test, a message appeared saying that the test bank is exhausted so there may be repetitions and the score will probably be biased.AS of the content, the theory is simply bad, the Math Section is difficult (which is OK) but the verbal is as far from the real GMAT questions as you can get (vague texts, unnecessarily long sentences and stupid questions). My test scores ranged from 560-700, obviously because I had so little time on 2 of them!Oh, and I forgot to mention the cheesy toddler-level presentations of the CD with stupid music and pictures!I am done with Kaplan! I don't recommend it, unless you just want to try everything on the market."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"This book's keyword &quot;2004&quot; is very misleading. I bought the 2003 edition in May and bought the 2004 edition in July, with the intention to do more practice problems. To my surprise, it is virtually identical to the 2003 version. Actually, as far as I can tell, only the cover page is different. I am extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I just took my GMAT and would like to share my experiences with the study aids that I had used. I had bought the usual ETS guide, the Kaplan 2004 with CD Rom, ARCO GMAT 2005 with CD Rom and, to try out something different, Ace the GMAT by Brandon Royal. I'll discuss two of the books I used.1) The Kaplan CD (the irritating toddler level presentation of the CD apart) has the toughest CAT exams. The tests are tough and designed to discourage you.I got 640,580, 600 and 620 in the 4 CAT's, but thanks to previous reviewers of the CD, I didn't lose heart since I knew that my score would be better on the real GMAT.I got a reasonable 710 on the real test.But do practice with these CAT's...the real GMAT is not easy. Practicing with tough questions will really help you think faster over time and not freak out when you see a particularly weird question on the real test.Also, the mini tests and the diagnostics do not give you enough time to finish them..but they are still some of the best questions to practice on.The book however, is not as good as the CD. ARCO does a better job of explaining the strategies and answers.2) Ace the GMAT, by Brandon Royal : This book is great for verbal practice as it breaks down Sentence Correction and Critical Reasoning into \\"problem types' and is very very comprehensive. When I started preparing for the GMAT two months before I was due to take the test, I had no idea about the verbal content.My native language is not English and I had never really learned english grammar at school. I can say that it's this book which put my fears to rest and showed me step by step, that even tricky grammar can be mastered in a short while....at least enough to do well on the GMAT. I got a 96th percentile on verbal and I attribute this score to this book.The other great feature about this book is the Analytical Writing portion.The essay structures are simple and can be easily reproduced and make scoring a 5.0 or better easy on the real test."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"In my personal mission to suceede on the GMAT I feel very comfortable with all of the books, and their high and low points. Honestly for me, this book was the best. The Princeston Review is a little too easy, and not quite as though as it should be. The Barron's is a little too difficult and does not seem to focus on what is really at hand.Kaplan book is written in an almost conversational style that will help guide and direct you in the areas that you need to study in. A thorough pretest is given, so you can know where you fall behind. From here you can then practice on the areas that you need.The book gives specific review information in for Reading comprehension, Math Review, Critical Reasoning, and Data Sufficency. The book gives tips, tricks, and ideas for mastering these questions that are easy to remember. The book also gives you some small lists that you should flat out memorize.This book comes with the best CD. The CD alone is well worth the price of the book. The CD comes with a pretest, and once you take the pretest, it comes out with several plans for you: long time to study, cram mode. The CD is interactive with video, games, and much more. Definately worthwhile on this basis alone.Out of all of the prep guides, this is the one you should pick up, best written book, and with the adaptive computer tests, and study guides on the CD you can't go wrong with this test."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Kaplan's \\"GMAT\\" book is good for getting into the right state of mind needed to succeed in the test and learning the powerful strategies for solving the hard questions. The strategies are similar (if not identical) to the strategies given in the Princeton Review book, though the latter explains some of the techniques better (and there lies the strength of the Princeton Review).The CD-ROM is the heart of the bargain.Packed with hundreds of questions and explanations, this CD provides countless hours of invaluable practice. In fact, the CDs of other companies I checked out don't begin to compare to Kaplan's.Nevertheless, there are two things you need to know in advance so that you won't be disheartened once you start working on the CD:The first is Kaplan's motto - \\"no pain no gain\\". Once you begin solving tests you'll discover that they are painfully difficult. The level of the tests' questions sometimes rises above the level of the real GMAT questions, but only sometimes. Bear in mind that the actual test is very hard and is made to challenge everyone, therefore it's mandatory not to be intimidated and to experience as many hard questions as possible.The second important thing is to remember that the test scores they supply are no way near the actual results you will eventually get on test day, probably because they use a different score calculating method from the one ETS uses. The reason for this might be rooted in the book and CD makers' possible goal - though not state out loud - to draw you to enroll in one of their preparation courses. Take my word for it, after seeing results for your first scored test - you WILL want to sign in immediately. Remember to take it in perspective.To sum it all up, keep in mind that as long as you make progress and keep on getting better results in adaptive tests from different sources you're on the road to success."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Like a couple of others who have reviewed this book, I promised that I would write in once I had completed the GMAT. Kaplan is frustrating and misleading.While the tutorials on the CD may have some useful information, they are childish and annoying in the way they are presented. I don't need a cartoon of a pussycat to explain computer adaptive testing to me. I think I'm motivated by a little more than cute graphics. Turning the soundtrack off was definitely a good idea.The main problem with the GMAT itself is that it is oriented towards the US education system. Subsequently, explanations of 'correct idiomatic language' are little more than facile lists that one should commit to memory. I'm a native English speaker from the southern hemisphere and I would never use many of the phraseologies dictated as 'correct'. Neither of the two books I used (Kaplan and the Official Review) sought to compensate for this, but I found Kaplan's answers particularly annoying.The quantative section in Kaplan is also devised to make you learn by rote rather than first principles. The disadvantage is that you don't learn to derive the answers yourself but apply patterns. And yes, it means more rote learning. The Kaplan questions were harder than those in the test and time allowed for the practice tests less than that allowed in the actual GMAT. Everything was geared up to give the impression that the test was harder than it actually was.The verbal questions in Kaplan were also misleading. Many of the 'correct' answers were difficult to justify and some illogical. It was clear that some of the questions were produced on a Friday afternoon and weren't checked well. The main problem was that the distinctions between answers was often very slight and the 'correct' answer asked you to make either a giant assumption or crawl inside the question writer's head to know what they're thinking.The section on the AWA is fairly rudimentary and the help available on this is limited. However, I've yet to find anything better on this other than paying for the computerised assessment on www.mba.com.On the real test I had the common experience of scoring 100 points above the scores I got on the Kaplan CD.Overall, I'd get the official review. If that doesn't have enough practice for you - you have too much time on your hands!!! I think confidence counts for more on the day than anything else."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"I had no idea what the GMAT covered, so this book was a good introduction to each section with basic tips to approaching specific question types. The CD-rom was helpful and contains a lot of additional practice material.Don't let your performance on the CD CAT exams discourage you. I only gave this book three stars because the practice questions are so ridiculously hard that you consider signing up for their $1250 class. My Kaplan practice test results were as follows (in chronological order):- Paper 600- Diagnostic 590- CAT 1 550- CAT 2 550 (I was ready to give up at this point.)My scores from the ETS CD:- CAT 1 610- CAT 2 720My actual score was a 700. Do as many practice questions as you can, from this book and the ETS Official Guide to the GMAT. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Unfourtunetely, I was expecting Kaplan's book to help me and develop my scores at GMAT. But this book didn't help me at all.The diagnostic test is the same as the year's 2000 edition. So if you are lucky and find it in some used bookstore don't even hesitate. All the extras added to this revision are usless. The online help that they promote in the cover are the same examples as in teh CD ROM.Added to this, I write a complain to the client service department, and three month later I'm still waiting for a response. Please consider t buy an older version of this book, it will save you money.If I have to highlight one advantage of this book will be the additional GMAT CAT TEST 4. But be aware if you do the paper based test first. You will find that most of the questions are going to be asked to you again in the CD ROM so one point less to KAPLAN 2004 edition."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"The Kaplan's and Princeton Review's &quot;main&quot; preparation books are quite similar with each other. Both make the same categorization for the types of problems in each of the areas of GMAT, but I think that in Kaplan's book the approaches to solve the problems are better organized and described. The questions of the Kaplan's book are more difficult than in the Princeton Review's book.The CD that comes with the book is superb. It contains a lot of very difficult questions and strict time limits to answer them. Especially the reading comprehension questions were a lot harder than e.g. in The Official Guide for GMAT. Don't get depressed about your test result scores, you will propably score better in the actual GMAT. By the way, I did not encounter any problems with the CD like some other reviewers. The music of the CD was horrible, but you can live with it.I would recommend this book for the preparation of GMAT."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Even after reading several reviews that warned the Kaplan practice test scores were lower than the actual GMAT scores, I worried about the results. Then, I took the second Official GMAT practice test and scored 100 points higher. When I took the actual GMAT, I scored even a bit higher than that.The CD was silly but helpful, and the more difficult problems forced me to think and work more quickly. I wish I had started with this instead of Barron's!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"The verbal section was thorough, thoughtfull, and very well organized. It really helped me to tackle corresponding questions on actual GMAT test. I'd especially recommend reading verbal section of the book to not native English speakers.The review of math was not regorous but good. I'd say that in order to answer math section, you need to have fundamental knowledge and some creativity, and the book seemed to address math in a straightforward manner. However, I'd strongly suggest those students who once passed Powerprep test and relaxed to review Kaplan math section. Both Kaplan and actual GMAT maths are much harder than that on Powerprep test.CD was very helpful. I'd recommend to pass all practice tests and simulations on it. Don't get frustrated by annoying introes and interface - just click Escape several times and get to real practice.One thing with the book is that instructions and some explanations are written in such childish and conspiratorial language as the one, I remember, my grand-mother was using when she had told me tales at night :) I believe the authors should address this issue in the next edition.Overall impression of the book and CD - good."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004","review":"Went through the practice sessions, skipped the diagnostic and went for the first Computer test. Got 670 ... wasn't happy but wasn't very disappointed either. Found a bunch of questions ambiguous too. Week later tried computer test 2 ... 600!!Panicked. But then remebered that the same kinda thing happened to me with GRE before (used Barrons that time). So I came to this site and found some solace in that other people found this test unrepresentative.Week later, tried powerprep test 1, got 750 and felt happy and vindicated. Secure in the knowledge that I was better than I thought I was, I decided to keep trying Kaplan tests. Week later... tried diagnostic paper test (was running out of tests by this time)... got 670. Tried Kaplan comp test 3 - 700 (this one has a question that refers to a nonexistent table!!!). Comp test 4 - 640.A week before the real thing tried powerprep test 2 - 770. Felt real good, but thought it would be presumptuous to trash Kaplan before taking the real thing.Today I wrote the real thing - got 760. So... here's what I think about this Kaplan thingie...Questions, especially in the verbal section, are ambiguous and almost always will leave you with two competing alternatives. I dont think that can be characterized as &quot;difficult&quot;, frustrating definitely. Real GMAT questions make you &quot;feel&quot; much better about the questions. Also, I flat out disagreed with some of the Kaplan answers and explanations. Others left me simmering unsurely.In hindsight I fully endorse the strategy I adopted. Take a powerprep test early on, and if you get a good score on that, you can continue taking Kaplan tests (to keep the momentum going) secure in the knowledge that your real GMAT scoring capability is better. Let the second powerprep test be the last mock test you take.However, I am not sure what advice to give you if your first powerprep test bombed. You probably have some areas to improve on, and if those areas happen to be in the verbal section then for sure Kaplan will not help you. Try getting retired GMAT paper tests (GMAC sells them on their website) but beware... these questions are known to be repeated in other powerprep tests, by GMAC's own admission upto 50% of retired test material is repeated in powerprep. Or you could try other vendors like Princeton review etc (dont know how good they are though)."},{"Title":"The Cocker Spaniel, Companion, Shooting Dog and Show Dog","review":"Wonderful reflection of the history and lineage of our beloved cocker spaniels."},{"Title":"The green fairy book","review":"I bought it so that I could read it to my kids and was excited when the book arrived.

As in all the volumes, the prose is clear and swift, moving the tales along. Since this was the third book in the series, he was not yet scraping the barrels of world fairy tales for the leavings; contrariwise, however, the first volume (Blue) has all of Ye Olde Stand-byes, while this and Red have tales just as wonderful that are less well known.Despite Lang's flaws -- most notably, his heroines have a way of turning passive -- there are far worse ways to introduce a child to the spirit of wonder tales than this volume."},{"Title":"The green fairy book","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."},{"Title":"The green fairy book","review":"The Green Fairy Book has stories from Spanish and Chinese traditions and a few written by the Comte de Caylus.

Many are comfortable, familiar, and traditional while others had definite writers and are a little less well-known. It's a great and enjoyable mix of tale titles; however, I was a little dissapointed that too many of the tales were essentially the same. I realize that this happens often in fairy tales, but it's still preferable to keep them out of the same book.Other than that, this is another fairy tale masterpiece for fans of the Lang collection."},{"Title":"The green fairy book","review":"Andrew Lang (1844-1912) wrote a number of books of fairy tales and differentiated each from the other by color; for example, this one is green, and others are pink, blue, grey, brown, and lilac. This is his third book \\"of many colors.\\" The first was blue and the second red. He drew his tales from many countries. He believes that the first fairy tales were written in Egypt \\"about Joseph's time, nearly three thousand five hundred years ago.\\" He contends that the authors of the fairy tales were made \\"by men who were childlike in their amusement, so they amuse children still.\\" Some were written to teach morals. But people read them to be amused and diverted rather than to learn lessons. He includes very old tales as well as some written only about two centuries before his time in France. Only one of the dozens of tales is well-known: The Story of the Three Bears. Lang is an excellent writer and children should enjoy his tales.Nevertheless, since they are all fairy tales, they have many of the usual items found in other fairy tales. The Blue Bird is an example. It is a story of love. It has a cruel stepmother and an ugly step sister and a husband who does not want to go against the wishes of his second wife. There are fairies and an enchanter. A ring plays an important part as well as other jewels. Clothes and being dressed up and looking beautiful is part of the tale. There are tricks in the tale and deceit and unjust imprisonment. There is also a princess, actually two of them, and a handsome prince, called King Charming. There is a magic spell that seems to ruin the chances for the lovers to get together; a transformation from a human to an animal, in this case a blue bird; and the magic number seven. And the beautiful princess is as usual very young, here age fifteen.Not all of the dozen tales have all these ingredients, but they are generally all very good."},{"Title":"The green fairy book","review":"My children and I use the Fairy Books series as part of our homeschooling program.

That said, be warned that the book is a very straightforward, bare-bones story... but it's also entertaining, in a simple way. The story deals with the adventures of a trio of neanderthals searching for a source of fire for their tribe after theirs is extinguished. The story gives fairly simplistic descriptions of their encounters with a wide variety of strange individuals and creatures. It almost reads like Hemmingway. You won't get in-depth portrayals of action, emotion, or grandeur, just a basic story, I guess much like Naoh or the others would tell it in their own language. It's a quick read (assuming you can find it used), so afterwards, be sure to rent the movie. You'll see how the story was modified and expanded on the screen, bringing much more significance to the finale."},{"Title":"The Quest for Fire A novel of Prehistoric Times","review":"I remember reading this book as a child several times and loving it. It had a raw sense of action, as the prehistoric story that tells of a tribe who had its fire extinguished in an enemy raid (a major tragedy in those times) and of three friends who set off on a quest to recover the fire from elsewhere. What follows is like a prehistoric Odyssey, as they encounter a whole range of threats both human, animal and natural - and put their physical characteristics as well as their pre-modern thinking to the ultimate test. Looking back, it's not such a profound book, and is probably best enjoyed by children as I did. In this case, it is a wonderful read about the dawn of what we know as humanity. The sequel Le Felin Geant (the Giant Cat in English) about the next generation would also fall in this category. However, as an adult reader, I think there are more thought-provoking examples of prehistoric fiction (namely Before Adam by Jack London)."},{"Title":"The Quest for Fire A novel of Prehistoric Times","review":"I love the movie \\"Quest for Fire\\", and I always wanted to read the novel it's adapted from. Problem was, I could never find it. A friend actually owned a beat-up copy, and she let me borrow it...but not keep it. I loved the book. After nine years, I finally found it from a used-seller here on this site. Used or not, I received it in great shape. The novel is not very long at 135 pages. It differs a bit from the movie, but the central theme remains the same.There is no Wagabui tribe; instead they're a gigantic (in height) tribe called the Blue-Skinned men. It's the cannibalistic Kzam tribe that attacks the Oulhamr tribe in the beginning and vexes them throughout the story. The novel starts after the attack with the Oulhamrs already running for cover and to regroup. The novel's dialogue is in English, unlike the primitive language created by Anthony Burgess for the film. However, the prose is presented in a different (primitive?) manner. There is no Ika character (played by Rae Dawn Chong) in the novel, and the Ivaka tribe in the movie are called the Thin Men or the Wahs in the novel. Like the movie, they hold the secret to the sacred Fire.The novel has the three Oulhamr warriors, Naoh the son of the Leopard, Gaw & Nam set out on the quest like the movie. Unlike the movie, the love interest is not Ika (as mentioned) or a girl from another tribe. If Naoh retrieves sacred Fire he gets the \\"ownership\\" of the Oulhamr's chief's daughter, Gammla, without giving any ransom in exchange and also be heir to the chief. In the novel, the Oulhamrs, based on their description, seem to resemble Neanderthals more than they do in the movie.The novel is presented in three parts; the first part is about the attack aftermath, the death of the sacred Fire, the beginning of the quest, killing the huge gray bear & eluding the giant lion and the tigress. Part two concerns itself with the feud between the Oulhamrs & the Kzams, Naoh gaining the trust of the Mammoths and Gaw getting separated after a fight with the Kzams. Part three was about the battle with the red-skinned Little Men, befriending the Wahs, learning the secret of fire, a run-in with the giant Blue-Skinned tribe, an encounter with the giant bear in the gorge, and a final battle (as in the movie) with three renegade Oulhamr warriors called the Hairy Ones led by Aghoo son of the Aurochs.Tremendous book, great descriptions without being too wordy. A real enjoyable & quick read with unusual and interesting characters, as well as exciting encounters and battles. Also, short chapters for readers with short attention spans. I felt the wait was worth it, and the search paid off. It also increased the enjoyment of the movie for me.

I can only assume that Jean-Jacques Annaud REALLY wanted to make a film about prehistoric man and preferred to make a movie based on this novel than make up his own story.The plot is like the movie, three Neanderthals have to search for fire after their own is put out.

He convincingly posits that unfettered, naked American power is the primary causal force on events of the time, thus disputing the now conventional \\"Domino Theory\\" and related ideological theories. US power so far superseded Soviet military and economic strength by the 1950's that total world strategic dominance had been attained. Porter argues that the US didn't stumble into the quagmire of Vietnam. We were propelled there by the belief that we couldn't lose and had much to gain by inserting ourselves, first by being the paymaster for the French and then by our own military intervention. The book fits nicely into an analytical tradition begun more recently by C Wright Mills in \\"The Power Elite.\\" Porter's book is carefully crafted and well documented so he doesn't attempt to draw out a historical tradition of power abuse in America. One would hope for a Porter follow-on book about this sordid American tradition, probably beginning just after the American Civil War and accounting for more than 200 military interventions up to and including present day Iraq.Review by Phillip Butler, PhD"},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"Vietnam is the red flag of modern American history and it has been done to death, usually by ax-grinders, memoirists, Restorationists, and Halberstams. There are exceptions: David Kaiser's \\"American Tragedy\\", Howard Jones's \\"Death of a Generation\\", John Newman's \\"JFK and Vietnam\\", Frederik Logevall's \\"Choosing War\\". Still, what can one possibly bring to this subject new in terms of information or interpretation? Gareth Porter has the answer.\\"Perils of Dominance\\" takes a topic of mind-boggling complexity, weaves a clear and consistent narrative from all the elements, and presents a picture staggering in its basic indictment of back-stabbing, endless lying, high crimes and misdemeanors, and outright treason. The traitors were the Hawk extremists who did all they could to drag John F. Kennedy(who successfully resisted until his execution) and Lyndon Johnson(whose resistance weakened under his huge domestic goals) into the war that killed 60,000 American soldiers and 3,000,000 Southeast Asians. Perhaps the most surprising and moving part of \\"Perils\\" is the picture of Lyndon Johnson, a strong opponent of expansion from Dallas through his defeat of Goldwater. We know of Tonkin Gulf, of course. And LBJ has been crucified for 40 years because of the deceptions involved. Porter shows us that it was Johnson himself who was most skeptical of the torpedo lies. And it was Johnson himself who trashed the attempts of the Hawks following the initial incident to fabricate more Tonkin Gulf-type phony attacks to justify the bombing of the North and takeover of the war by the U.S. military. Once elected, of course, LBJ gave up the ghost and the rest is genocidal history.The real hero of the book is John F. Kennedy. Kaiser, Jones and Newman had gone pretty far in making the case that if not for Dallas, there would have been no wider war. And the horrors of the 60s and 70s for Southeast Asia would have been avoided. (At least the U.S. generated part of it.) Gareth Porter clinches it. Kennedy here is a true Machiavellian, outflanking and trumping opponents of his anti-war policy, playing things very close to the vest. Until Diem. The murders of Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother shocked Kennedy. And -- perhaps for the first time -- he understood exactly what he was up against. In the weeks that followed, he spoke often of his own death and possible assassination. Including the morning of November 22, 1963.One hopes for a sequel from Porter, taking us through the anguish of Johnson's second term, and into the intentional genocide of the Whittier Vampire and his Nobel Peace Prize-winning lapdog."},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"In the first place, Gareth Porter was 'on the ground' as an independent scholar, un-armed and un-protected in Vietnam's I Corp in '68. It was already notorious as scene of the heaviest fighting, and it was later infamous as the locale of the My Lai massacre. His courage and commitment cannot be matched by the plethora of chicken hawks who attempt to obfuscate the causes of the debacle and justify the taking of 3 million lives.How could the disastrous consequences of the exercise of power be taken on so blindly? I think of another folly now openly admitted, which was exposed by the same methods of investigation. \\"I did it just because I could\\" is the simple reason President Bill Clinton gave Larry King as to why he went at it with Monica - and he called his rationale the worst of all reasons humans can use for immoral conduct.Thanks to Kenneth Starr, we even know which senator Clinton was on the phone with during one of his assignations, because mundane documents were meticulously interrelated until no one could hide much of anything.To a much higher purpose, Gareth Porter has sifted through day by day logs of the Kennedy & Johnson era White House and examined relevant notes, memoirs and meeting transcripts kept by the players and staff. His investigation is no less meticulous, and we see how both JFK and LBJ tried to be more in tune with larger political issues and more worthwhile national agendas as they sought viable alternatives. But Perils also reveals how \`the Whiz Kids' were able to throw in more and more firepower and destruction through a series of short term, dispassionate maneuverings of their \`Commander in Chief.'It was fascinating to have this glimpse of the inner workings of two administrations as the events played out into rivers of blood. Time after time after time, JFK especially would be assured that certain things would be done along the more diplomatic lines he wanted; that new possibilities for peace, or at least for de-escalation, would be opened and new options explored. He would think this, as we can see from various eyewitness accounts laid out in \`Perils' because the assignments he made and agreements he entered into were documented and are recounted here. And time after time after time, we see how the players would walk out of the meetings and do the opposite of what they'd just assured the President they would do for him, and do it in his name.Then you look at the players who kept JFK impotent, and you realize that they all had connections to that \`military industrial complex' of which Ike had so recently warned. Gareth calls that the \`National Security Apparatus' and it has only grown stronger.The relevance of Perils of Dominance is striking as we stand on the verge of yet another escalation. As with Vietnam to Laos to Cambodia, we're seemingly to be taken from Afghanistan to Iraq to Iran, with no one to hold a candle to Kennedy's brilliance in attempting to stop the madness."},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"Does not present any new eveidence, but looks at everythingthat has been known for some time in a very different light,casting doubts not only as to how we have viewed the conflictsin Southeast Asia, but the entire Cold War as well, right up tothe \\"perils\\" of the present American dominance"},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"Gave four stars only because book ends with the big build up of 1965. Excellent on the behind the scenes political activity that got us into the full scale war. Interesting that both Johnson and Kennedy tried to get us out but wanted to do so without getting blamed for \\"losing the war\\" and suffering the political ramifications. Well researched, written with great depth and highly readable for anyone interested about the history of the war. Makes a good case that the president doesn't so much make national security policy as the national security apparatus of the various agencies and the National Security Council control the information that he gets and they bend it towards the outcome they wish."},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"Gareth Porter has written an controversial account of the origins of the Vietnam War. According to Porter, the origins of US involvement in the Vietnam War, was not the domino theory but a fear of American allies such as Thailand switiching sides from a strong US ally toward having a neutral position with the Chinese if South Vietnam fell.American national security adivisors feared that if Thailand was to become neutral than Chinese infleunce would expand in the region. Another ineteresting contention of Porter's book is that the Vietnamese, Chinese, and the Russians would have signed on to a treaty that would have left a neutral but non-Communist South Vietnam due to their fear of American power. But the American national security establishment thought any neutral South Vietnam could be under the influence of the Chinese and rejected such offers. I would reccomend this book for anyone who are interested in not only the origins of the Vietnam War, but the Second Iraq War as well."},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"Do you believe the President sits atop the government as an independent judge of what should be done by the executive branch - a final point at which group-think might be turned aside?Read this book to find out how it really works. The President can easily be a captive of the political system and is not free to act, simply because he is as afraid as anyone else of being blamed if things go wrong. He can be managed by those below him by skillful use of, or cover-ups of essential documents and studies. Words and phrases in reports can be ordered to be changed, an honest report can be rewritten by a superior, meetings can be called off or scheduled to reinforce or diminish the importance of an issue.This history of the lead-up to full involvement by the United States in the war in Vietnam shows how the national security establishment (JCS, DoD, CIA and State) can be blinded by a particular vision of a situation that, to their thinking, dictates a course of action, in this case, the involvement of U.S. troops in combat in Southeast Asia. Obsessed with the suppression/containment of Communism at a time when the US was unchallenged, no one could see that those opposed to the partition of Vietnam would continue to fight no matter what the United States decided to do. Despite the eagerness of North Vietnam to avoid a U.S. combat role, the possibility of compromise and negotiation was resolutely shut off.Anyone the least bit interested in international affairs should read this book because it reveals the inner workings of power. It presents, heavily documented with notes, a detailed account of such things as the Tonkin Gulf incident and the domino theory, a useful ploy known in the 1960's not to be based in reality.Anyone interested in American Presidencies will also find illumination here. Both Kennedy and LBJ were very much against rushing into the Vietnam conflict, yet both uninthusiastically took the necessary steps to make it happen. The fact that each of them could have stopped the process using their authority, but instead yielded to relentless pressure shows how human they were and reinforces the tragedy of the conflict for the country, the soldiers and the commander in chief."},{"Title":"Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam","review":"This book makes structural what too many on the fake left like Chomsky Hersh Cockburn mock with namecalling when the same point is actually brought up with the JFK assassination: the CIA WAS NOT ALWAYS AN POLICY INSTRUMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.

While the US had significantly more tactical and strategic nuclear weapons than the Soviets, all the way into the late 60's, the Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO forces in Europe by over 2:1 with a comparable level of capability in its forces. Considering the known ramifications of even a \\"limited\\" nuclear exchange, this was not an option except in the most dire of circumstance. US military dominance was anything but \\"total\\" in the early days of the cold war and in many ways was at a distinct disadvantage in many military areas, a scenario that played in the Korean War. The books' contention that US involvement in Vietnam was fairly new until Kennedy, the fact is that US confrontations with communism in Asia had a long history including support of the French against communist guerrillas in Vietnam, the Philippines an Burma in the late 40's and early 50's.\\"Perils of Dominance\\" also bases its \\"novel\\" interpretation of postwar Vietnamese history and politics almost exclusively from North Vietnamese sources along with their decidedly apologetic conclusions. These sources are retrospective justifications for the brutal policies of Hanoi, and do not stand up to scrutiny, but Porter eagerly regurgitates their analysis of the political situation in post WWII Vietnam. This simple version of history where Hanoi is an innocent victim of western Imperialism, driven to extremes by unwarranted provocation is not a new one for Porter. For example, Porter repeats the line that the VC were a completely indigenous and independent movement in South Vietnam flies in the face of the fact that the VC were controlled and orchestrated from Hanoi since at least the early 50's.This book sounds suspiciously like another widely praised piece of Porter's brand of revisionism on Pol Pot:\\"The U.S. and government and news media commentary have gone to great lengths to paint a picture of a country ruled by irrational revolutionaries, without human feelings, determined to reduce their country to barbarism. This study is aimed at setting the record straight on these crucial events.\\"In short, Porter needs to give up his 30 year fantasy."},{"Title":"Indian Life on the Upper Missouri 1ST Edition","review":"Indian Life on the Upper Missouri consists of fifteen articles written by John Ewers brings to life the culture of the Native American culture in the Upper Missouri region. He covers everything from remembrances of the days before horses were introduced into the region to the artistic depiction of this culture in the twentieth century. His prose is clear and non-academic, although his subject matter is treated in a very organized and concise manner, similar to academic writing. This book would be useful both for the academic and the casual reader. The use of graphics ties well to the writing and is used to enlighten rather than just to illustrate.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in a study of the Indians on the northern reaches of the Great Plains."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is my favorite Salinger book. I read it every year again, and it's a touchpoint for me about how my view of the world is changing.I think Salinger's penchant for weaving multiple storylines together that he did in 9 Stories and with other stories involving the Glass family is in its best form here, with 2 focal people. It's a great twist that those two people are in the same house for much of the book.Salinger does a great job of setting the whole thing in an apartment that's getting painted and a bathroom where Zooey is washing and preparing to leave. Essentially the entire space is in transition, a bit of a phoenix cycle, as are the two main characters. And in that setting he weaves magic of what it means to be a human in this world. And the last 15 pages or so is the best conversation and accompanying metaphor out there."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny was a great story, but Salinger brought it home in Zooey. I will cherish this story for life and recommend that literature fans everywhere read at some point."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book was recommended in my reading of JD Salinger's biography. I was even more curious to read it after reading Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey takes place in a large apartment in upper Manhattan. There is an isolation, seclusion and haunting quality to life in the apartment. The story revolves around Franny Glass, the youngest of the Glass family. The Glass parents are successful and talented performers.Franny is at a crisis point in her young life, a spiritual crisis. She appears to have broken down. Zooey is sent to talk to her. Both Franny and Zooey are precocious, and a bit egotistical as they begin a long personal and searching discussion.The book is not dated, and in my view; it is still relevant and brilliant. The simple white cover and young, lively font capture the story's essence. Franny and Zooey goes much deeper than Catcher in the Rye, and it remains Salinger's greatest book. What makes it great is the conclusion. A conclusion that is both satisfying and surprising."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I don't know that this was as good a book as Catcher in the Rye, or that it's characters are quite as lovable as Holden, but I found Franny to be reminiscent of Holden-- both a little too smart and sensitive for their own good, and I love the conversation Franny and Zooey have at the end; it made me wish Holden had a Zooey too.ps- the Glass family member who is as lovable as Holden is Seymore-- if you love Holden and haven't read it yet, try \\"Raise High the Roofbeam Carpenters\\""},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"\\"Franny and Zooey\\" is J.D. Salinger's last great book. Published in 1961, it actually consists of two pieces, a longish short story dating from 1955 (\\"Franny\\") and a novella from 1957 (\\"Zooey\\"). This would be followed in 1963 by Salinger's last full-length work, \\"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction.\\" That one was published in 1963, although \\"Raise High...\\" dates from 1955 and \\"Seymour\\" from 1959.It was with \\"Raise High...Seymour\\" that Salinger descended into writing so mannered that it began to feel stilted and stifling rather than liberating. \\"Raise High\\" is actually quite good, but \\"Seymour\\" is so self-conscious that it simply can't carry its own weight, although there are some fine moments in it.\\"Franny and Zooey,\\" on the other hand, displays the intellectual spark and superb writing that had distinguished Salinger's only novel, \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" and his fiction collection \\"Nine Stories.\\" The prose is nimble, the dialogue varies from hilarious to heartbreaking, and the setting is beautifully drawn, almost cinematic -- you can see the Glass's apartment in your mind's eye quite clearly as you read the two interlocking pieces.\\"Franny\\" focuses on the youngest member of that family of prodigies, the Glasses. In the story, Franny basically has an emotional breakdown brought on by ... well, what is it, really? A spiritual epiphany? A spiritual crisis? A little of both. Essentially, she becomes obsessed with a prayer that has both Christian and Zen resonances. It also becomes evident that college life is not exactly turning out to be fulfilling for her.\\"Zooey\\" chronicles the aftermath of that breakdown, as Franny retreats to the Glass apartment, where she is both comforted and challenged by the second-youngest of the Glass siblings, Zooey. Both these young adults must be geniuses -- but Zooey is simply off the charts; one wonders if his IQ truly could be measured. Zooey also seems to have come to grips with some of the spiritual ecstacy/angst that is besetting Franny.I never cease to marvel at this story, which I must have read a dozen times. Salinger has abandoned what most people would consider good rules of writing; the narrative has very little conventional drive, for example. There's a long description of Zooey taking a bath, and intertwined with that, a portrait of the Glass matriarch, Bessie, who comes off as more grounded but also more naive than her offspring. Salinger also doodles around with a letter Zooey is reading, which, it turns out, was penned by another Glass sibling, Buddy (J.D. Salinger's fictive alter ego).Despite its deliberate pace, though, the story never feels plodding or leaden; somehow, Salinger pulls you along, and if I could figure out how to make such a leisurely style so mesmerizing, I'd be writing novels and short stories instead of Amazon reviews.True, the Glass children can be a bit ... annoying. I mean, come on, is any one family REALLY this gifted? For the most part, though, there's a charm about them that can be almost radiant.The ending of \\"Franny and Zooey\\" is nothing less than magnificent -- humorous, poignant, lovely and thoughtful, all at once.This is terrific literature, almost deserving of a five-star rating -- but that would accord it the same stature as \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" and the fact is that \\"Franny and Zooey\\" just misses being that good. I commend it to every reader who appreciates excellent characters and good detail and an idiosyncratic view of life."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"[...]I certainly have nothing wildly original to contribute to what's already been written about Salinger and his work. Originally published in the New Yorker and focused on the youngest of the Glass children, Franny focuses on the genesis of Franny's spiritual/existential crisis and the companion novella Zooey tackles Zooey's reaction as Franny takes brings her breakdown to the family home in Manhattan. Salinger's narrative voice is so strong and his characters so dynamic and vibrant. My favorite scene takes place in the Glass family bathroom as Zooey's bath is interrupted by Bessie, his meddlesome mother. Whether meant as a religious parable or love story, it's certainly thought-provoking and rife with memorable moments and enviable dialogue (I *wish* I could be as intentional, witty and, when appropriate, eviscerating as Zooey when I speak!).Rubric rating: 8. I wasn't crazy about Catcher in the Rye the first time around (but then again, the first time around I was a 14 year old girl) and Franny and Zooey made me want to give it another shot."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I had read Catcher in the Rye, in high school and really enjoyed it. I had wanted to read more by J.D. Salinger, so I bought Franny and Zooey. It took me a while to really understand what was happening in the book. So much so that I didn't get everything until a few days after finishing it. This is what I think makes it such an amazing book. You might not remember everything they talked about or that happened, but the feeling and meaning of it stays with you."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read this book when I was in college, and I probably wasn't as tolerant of it then as I am today. Angst doesn't particularly interest me in that it makes for boring reading. Elitism doesn't much interest me, either, for the same reason: it makes for boring reading. However, Salinger was a great writer, who chose words with care. He was brilliant at bringing to life a certain kind of New York (they always felt like New Yorkers to me, a Midwesterner) teen who just couldn't cope with people around him or her. It's Others who are the problem for such teens. They want Others to be perfect, and to conform to their expectations of how Others should behave. Part of growing up is learning to cope with all the imperfections in people and situations. Part of growing up is certainly learning how to prioritize the things that \\"bother\\" one. It's a joy to see how Salinger brings his characters from avoidance to, if not acceptance, at least to coping."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I picked this one up expecting to love it. And, at times I did. I thought the deep philosophical questions were great and it was wonderful to read an author who clearly is thinking deeply...Somehow, though, it was very hard for me to remain engaged completely. Frankly, I've never had such a short book feel so long."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Yes, Salinger writes about religion. And yes, he writes about the phoniness of modern culture. But in my opinion, the entire book is giving us the message that Zooey gives Franny in the end: That there isn't anybody anywhere who isn't Seymour's Fat Lady. Read again about the Fat Lady -- Zooey says that he never wanted to wear clean socks cuz he was on the radio and who would know whether they were clean or not. And yet Seymour made him wear clean socks for &quot;the Fat Lady.&quot; I think all he's saying is that here, on this earth and in this life, none of us really knows how the world works. All we can do is assume that the way we live our lives could affect countless other people that we never see, and in ways we'll never know. So we need to live with self respect and dignity and integrity. And we need to be kind and compassionate, not only to others but to ourselves. We can't worry about who's a phony or what the next person believes or not. If we keep a harmony within ourselves about what we do and how we treat each other, then in that harmony we'll find &quot;god&quot; in whatever form we can most easily accept it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"(Review based on the Penguin edition of said book)After having read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and \\"Nine Stories\\", \\"Franny & Zooey\\" was the logical step onward. I absolutely adore JD Salinger, and that book didn't disappoint me at all.In this short novel - in two parts - you get to know more about the Glass family, first touched upon in \\"Nine Stories\\".Salinger is definitely one of the most talented writers I've ever had the pleasure to read, and I just can't get enough of his writings. He's at once witty, profound, extremely intelligent, humane, well-read, and God knows how many other adjectives I could list here.So what's this book about? I'd say, perhaps wrongly, that it's about life for people who are too intelligent to have an easy ride through it. But even that sort of description doesn't do the book justice. I just don't know how to describe this book without failing to do so; I think it's better to just trust me and go buy it right away (provided you read the two former books I mentioned at the beginning of this review). You have to experience this!I'm sorry about my reviews in general (and this one among them) because I never really write anything amazing unless I have something negative to say and criticise; the better the book, the worse the review. Salinger's treasures are too subtle to be apptly described in a review. I could say I love his style and everything, that I find him extraordinary and talented as hell, but that wouldn't do much convincing of anyone reading this review. Salinger may not please everyone, but you definitely must find out for yourself if you like his books or not."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"To be honest, I read Franny and Zooey simply because my name is Zoe and people would always bring up the book, which was quite irritating (oh, and I'm a girl). So I basically read it so that I didn't seem ignorant everytime someone mentioned it. Suprisingly though, it is one of the best books I have ever read (I only write reviews on my favorites and least favorites). I know I'll be chastised for saying this because so many will disagree, but I really think that Franny and Zooey is to Catcher in the Rye what Villette is to Jane Eyre. Yes, I realize they are completely different. But people often give more recognition to Catcher in the Rye (and Jane Eyre) than to Franny and Zooey (and Villette). Villette and Franny and Zooey are the more risque of the novels (if such a thing is possible to say) and some of the intelligent types who bother to read them often find them better then their partners (which are usually mandatory school books which always increases dislike). Not to say Catcher in the Rye is not a brilliant book. It may be better than Franny and Zooey, I really cannot say. When I began F & Z I loved the first part about Franny and then it switches to the Zooey part...and well it seems to get dull, but it's really just an illusion, I swear, by the time you get farther into the section you recognize the background more for what it is, and the insight it gives you to the family. I love Salinger because it's so casual, which makes the novel feel as if it were being read to you instead of you reading it for yourself. F & Z is no exception. It's really upseting to me to read all the negative views, because I went into reading this book expecting to not like it, and came out loving it, so if that's possible I don't see how others can detest it as they do. I think some people simply do not understand the content of the book, so please do not be swayed by negative reviews. Out of all the books to share a name with a charachter, there are certainly worse. Oh, and I'm fifteen, but don't think this book is only for the young. If this book took you a lifetime to read and truly understand then you'll probably learn more then most will ever in their lifetime."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Having read all three of Salinger's published books, I was eager to see what he had to say in his other major piece on the Glass family. Besides indulging us in this unusual collection of characters, Salinger provides his answers to some of the most perplexing problems in his others stories, including 'catcher in the rye.' We all remember Holden's difficulty dealing with all the phony people in society as well as the death of his brother Allie. In this novel, Zooey guides Franny as she uncovers unsettling truths about phony people, and ultimately gives her some reassurance that meditation and reflection on mythical figures can answer these anxieties. Anyone who has read this book might also want to read 'Raise High the Roofbeams Carpenters; and Seymour, an Introduction' to learn more about Seymouor, who plays such a vital role in 'F&amp;Z' despite the fact he isn't in it. Moreover, 'F&amp;Z' gives some hints as to how Seymour met his mysterious fate.All this being said, you can see how there is so much to get out of this novel. If it weren't for the fact that I read 'Catcher' when I was young, this novel woudl have undoubtedly become my favorite Salinger piece."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Coming from a Salinger obsessive, the stories are great. &quot;Zooey&quot; even made me cry at the end. Jerry rocks my world-- these two stories serve as an example of his great insight into life. If you are someone who has ever been fed up with your school or job or just life in general, you will find solace by reading F&amp;Z."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"However unfortunate it is that this is Mr. Salinger's last published work is irrelevant. What follows after the title page is an onslaught of character dialogue that would be served an injustice if described as something other than &quot;pure genius&quot;. It is astounding how Salinger took and formed these amazing beings out of pure literary thought. Where other authors falter at creating characters that are conceivably from the same mindset, the uniqueness of the Glass familys' personalities give evidence to the brilliance this man portrayed in novel form. The flow of the story is perfect, with the Franny section you receive and apply emotions to this character that pour out uncontrollably upon reading the Zooey section. The feeling this book leaves the reader with seems almost planned by Salinger, a possible hint at the fact that this was going to be the last book disclosed to the public. Despite all the negative press he has received for being somewhat of a hermit and ogre, J. D. Salinger's writing should be a staple in the lives of every adolescent youth. The Glass family a model for an idealistic belief system in American society and families today. However personal he has kept his feelings from the end of this book, there is no doubting that this man has mastered his craft."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"It wasn't until my fourth reading or so of Franny and Zooey that I began to understand that J.D. Salinger's topic is grief. Grief over his brother's death is the force that drives Holden Caufield as it is the source of Franny's breakdown. Franny and Zooey is a book of remarkable spriritual insight. I marvel at each reading."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; is a fantastic book. Brillintly sculpted, carefully thought-out, profoundly insigtful, and deeply spiritual, it is a prime example of what literature can be when at it's best.&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; answers the questions J.D. Salinger presents in &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; without contradicting &quot;Catcher...&quot;'s basic message. Holden Caufield's critique of modern society and it's effect on and manifestations in humanity are, in many ways, affirmed in these two tales. Franny, an intellingent, thoughtful, young, college student, echoes Holden's complaints in her extended conversation with her brother. However, while in &quot;Catcher...&quot; Salinger merely presents a problem, in &quot;F&amp;Z&quot; he, through Zooey, provides real, profound answers.What drives both parts of this story are the characters. The intoxicating Glass family, whom the author so memorably fills out in much of his other work, provide the perfect family setting for a discussion, not just of society's problem, but of the characters' own demons. Salinger relies heavily on his charcters' personalities to sustain both the intense dialoge and the personal story lines. In the end, Salinger needs the intimacy his characterization provides. It allows for an enormously powerful and effective delivery of a message that lends itself to sounding preachy.The story presents a number of themes, ranging from the conflict between spirituality and everyday, bread and water existance, finding one's place in society, to understanding and appreciating family. However, the theme which seems to be closest to the story, and which seems to be most important for Salinger, is that of acceptance of one's surrounding and the need for making each act a sacrifice to something greater. Franny's complaints about her professers and the audience and everything else while she's at it are not disputed. Everything else isn't the point. The point is that she must make her life, her every act, a continual sacrifice to something beyond her. In this way, not by rejecting everything and selfishly, egotistically removing herself from society, holing up in her own private inner sanctuary. By making this particular point, Salinger responds to the questions that arise out of the world view he presents. He gives permission to contribute to and participate in the society he indicts by taking the focus off the society and placing it on the greater purpose.In this engaging and entertaining read, Salinger presents the reader not only with an extrodinary cast of charcters, but a healthy, effective solution for all those who are really dissalussioned youth at heart."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Like many people I was first introduced to the works of Salinger in my teens. At the time I first read Franny and Zooey I was 19 and going through a typically teenage rough patch. It may be dramatic but I can still say, nearly 12 years later, that this book had a huge affect on me - pulling me out of a very dark period. Salingers 'voice' is clear and authoritative and his characters fancy themselves as mentors - stearing wayward youth from the edge. Like a lot of teens, this is exactly what I was looking for.Last month I re-read the book and found it to still be a wonderful story but much of the inspiration I took from it years ago seems weak and at times even patronising today. Perhaps I have become too cynical.Franny and Zooey is a wonderfully written story and evokes the mood of it's time. I would recommend this book to anyone, but I believe it's true power will be best appreciated by a younger audience."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I've just finished my third reading (over the course of twenty years) of what I consider to be Salinger's most intriguing work. \\"Catcher\\" is much more satisfying from a narrative perspective, but \\"Franny and Zooey\\" is superior thematically.Although this book has often been knocked for its wordiness, especially in the longer of the two stories: Zooey, a modern re-examination reveals its influence in many popular writers of today: J. Robert Lennon, Tom Robbins, and David Foster Wallace are three who spring to mind immediately. But back to the knock of \\"wordiness\\" F&Z; has had to endure. The charge reminds me of a criticism of Mozart's work in the film Amadeus: \\"too many notes.\\"Seems to me that a reader who enjoys language, ideas, mood, and character might argue that the 200 pages of this book go by far too quickly! Salinger uses the dialogue and setting to artfully render his point and deliver it with maximum impact. Entertainingly petty, meandering arguments in the beginning build into substantial considerations and emotional rememberances to make way for a finale that strikes hard and deep. If you read this book and get into it, you will never forget its arguments (even if you disagree with most of them).All of that aside, though, the 41 pages that comprise the Franny portion of the book stand up as one of the most skillfully written and purely entertaining pieces of work I've ever read. It is astounding what Salinger accomplishes in this story with little more than dialogue and descriptions of character mannerisms. I have found myself, over the years, in several restaurants that match the mood of this story so nearly that I find myself looking around for the table Lane and Franny occupy. If you don't want to wade through the philosophical/spiritual arguments in the Zooey story, at least read Franny."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"How is it possible to transform seemingly mundane conversations and goings-on into provocatively compelling dialogue and enticingly iridescent prose with masterful ability? Read Franny &amp; Zooey and find out. Two brooding, yet illuminating short stories published in The New Yorker 2 years apart, Franny &amp; Zooey exists as a book with two inseparably joined stories on one level; conversely they, almost without exception, also exist as two patently disparate short stories unique unto themselves.Although written in 3rd person, the amount of not so infrequent profound introspection that emanates from the acutely neurotic Franny &amp; Zooey leaves one in awe of Salinger's unimpeachable acumen for fiction. For those in doubt, just read the first page and witness Salinger's penchant for jaw-dropping prose as he somehow magically transmogrifies a rather uneventful setting into an engrossingly captivating one.Franny is acutely plagued by an insufferable disillusionment in a name-dropping pedantic collegiate environment that has sapped her passion for college and the cookie cutter lifestyle that invariably will accompany it soon after. Zooey's unremitting, if not humorous, cynicism and his biting sardonic commentary on his overbearing mother, Franny's esoteric religious beliefs, and on society in general make a perfect yin for Franny's yang.&quot;Sometimes I think that knowledge-when it's knowledge for knowledge's sake, anyway-is the worst of all.&quot;- Franny"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Anyone who has ever felt the least bit mad or alone in this world should read this book. While &#8220;Catcher in the Rye&#8221; may be Salinger&#8217;s most famous work, &#8220;Franny and Zooey&#8221; grabs you by the heart and refuses to let go. The characters&#8217; struggles and realities, however little, fickle, or self-absorbed, become your own. And you feel for them. You feel sorry for these well-to-do, Ivy League success stories.Franny is the most lost character in the book. She wants to do away with selfishness and greed, finding herself disgusted by her own wants and lusts. She&#8217;s not pretentious, or at least, not aware of it; and neither are the readers. She&#8217;s trying to grow up and realizing exactly who she doesn&#8217;t want to become. She becomes obsessed, crazed even, with reciting &#8220;The Jesus Prayer&#8221; because it&#8217;s supposed to allow her to see God. She&#8217;s looking for answers and unable to always handle her realities. Her nervous breakdown reads like insight into our own lives, questions, and fears.Franny&#8217;s wanting to be original and unique and is well-aware that everyone ends up conforming in certain ways, no matter how much they protest. &#8220;It's everybody, I mean. Everything everybody does is so &#8212; I don't know &#8212; not wrong, or even mean, or even stupid necessarily. But just so tiny and meaningless and &#8212; sad-making. And the worst part is, if you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you're conforming just as much only in a different way.&#8221;Zooey, her older brother, is able to challenge Franny and her beliefs, and perhaps is all that stands in the way of her madness. He calls her on her hypocrisies and her flawed belief system. &#8220;You don't know how to talk to people you don't like. Don't love, really. You can't live in the world with such strong likes and dislikes.&#8221;Zooey is also flawed, with his own self-destructive tendencies and readers begin to realize the mental state of the two siblings is tied back to their unconventional childhood. Being thrust into the limelight and made into child intellects has run a toll on them, and now, crammed full of knowledge, the youngest siblings find themselves reacting to their tragedies in different ways.At the heart of this novel is their older brother Seymour&#8217;s suicide. Though it took place long before, the Glass children are still rattled at their core by the loss of their older brother. There&#8217;s a beauty, however, knowing that he is still so much a part of their lives, their beliefs, and their memories."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYFor many, The Catcher in the Rye is the extent of their exposure to Salinger.

The novel starts with the short story \\"Franny,\\" where the heroin struggles with a spiritual conversion she's not quite sure she's actually having. Her difficulties surround her, in everything. She can't escape. There is no resolution.Next we get \\"Zooey,\\" a novella focused on the novel's true protagonist (or grown-up Holden), as he weeds through his family life, his two older genius brothers who have influenced his and Franny's life tremendously, for better or worse. We get his take on the acting life, true spirituality, and brilliance.The whole book is a blazing philosophical and spiritual exercise, surely echoing many of Salinger's own positions, as he explores the truths and untruths and ramifications of trying to find the underpinnings of life. It moves slowly, but the conversation is fascinating--Salinger is brilliant at writing conversation, with emphases, colloquial speech, and (usually) authentic speaking rhythm. It's an easy read and I would recommend, simply for the relatable family dynamics and the very provoking spiritual and religious questionings.--- ---\\"any name of God--any name at all--has this peculiar, self-active power of its own, and it starts working after you've sort of started it up\\" (37)\\"The cards are stacked (quite properly, I imagine) against all professional aesthetes, and no doubt we all deserve the dark, wordy, academic deaths we all sooner or later die.\\" (59)\\"Phooey, I say, on all white-shoe college boys who edit their campus literary magazines.

Dog eared here and there and some pen markings, but nothing major. Exceeded expectations. But on the pack of the \\"Zooey\\" cover page, someone wrote \\"Pat + Andrew are mean!\\", I'm not really bothered by that, I just think it's really funny, I just want to know who Pat and Andrew are, and why they're so mean."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This novel is a correlation of two stories concerning the youngest members of the Glass family, Franny and Zooey. The Glass children were brought up in New York on a talk show for genius children. Franny is a young college student visiting her intellectual boyfriend at his university for the weekend where she has a nervous breakdown over religious matters. Zooey, Franny's older brother, assists his sister in her breakdown, although he suffers emotional distresses of his own. The book consists of three conversations- Franny and her boyfriend, Zooey and their mother, and finally, Franny and Zooey. J.D. Salinger's quick, and often witty, dialogue is persistent throughout. Also, Salinger does an excellent job with the character development in this novel, as well as his other stories. The reader feels a sort of personal connection and relatability to each character.J.D. Salinger focuses on the effects of one's upbringing and family dynamics. Salinger selects the youngest of the seven Glass children to highlight Franny's confusion and Zooey's concern for his sister. Family is a huge reoccurring theme and becomes the cause and the solution to many of the children's emotional issues. Religion, especially Christianity and Buddhism, is another theme throughout the novel. Salinger studied Eastern religion and his interest in Buddhism is reflected. Religion prevents Franny and Zooey from living a \\"normal\\" life, and also leads to Franny's dissatisfaction with college.If you are looking for a highly plot-based, entertaining book, do not read this. Franny and Zooey is intellectually stimulating and arouses controversial questions and thoughts. It is very easy to become quite lost in what is going on in the conversations. You must read critically in order to understand the author's purpose. It is also helpful to know the history of America during the 50's and 60's, as well as some backgroundinformation on the author. Many readers have found strong connections between J.D. Salinger's most famous novel, Catcher in the Rye. If you are a fan of J.D. Salinger, it is a must read. Once the reader has fully understood the novel, Franny and Zooey is one book you will remember for very long time."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I have never wanted to rush through a book before just so I could start reading it again. This one hits in all the right places."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"JDS does a beautiful job with this text. I'm afraid no matter how glowing my terms might be, I might still feel they wouldn't adequately describe the text. JDS is not afraid of any length of story and his treatment of characters is unprecedented."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"There are many great reviews, but I thought I would take a moment to discuss this novel and why I enjoyed it.If you are a Salinger fan, then his work needs no introduction. He only published one novel, this collection which includes a short story and a novella, and a collected work of short fiction.Though I consider Catcher to be one of the greatest books written in the 20th century, this still deserves high praise, though it is hard to compare to Catcher. We follow the Glass family through these two stories, the characters that were lightly introduced in a few of his '9 stories'. I won't get into specifics, but the stories are connected. The first, the short story, involves Franny Glass and her boyfriend at dinner. The resulting scenes end with her nervous breakdown, and make for great reading. The second story focuses more on her brother Zooey and his interaction with her and their mother just after Franny's breakdown. Both stories are full of emotion, meaning, and substance. I highly recommend this as a great book to spend a weekend with!"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"My mother recomended this book to me during a time where I really needed some sort of guidance. I needed someone to relate to. Franny was that person. I cannot even explain how much I adore this book, the characters, and what I learned from it. Now, anytime I feel out of place or unhappy I pick up Franny and Zooey and somehow things are put into perspective."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I believe that Salinger has offered us a follow-up. In high school we had &quot;Catcher&quot;, and now, in college, and not yet able to let go of Holden's hand, Franny and Zooey offers the next steps to surviving in a phony world. As mentioned in the book, this is a story about love much more than religion or mysticism. I feel Salinger brings up different sects to show us that everyone is capable of finding and spreading the guidance we all need to more beautifully live together."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I have just finished reading Franny and Zooey, and it( like A Catcher In The Rye ) amazed me. Salinger's style and use of language has again captured me into the heart of this book. I found this book not as good as A Catcher In The Rye, but right up there underneath it. Franny's spirtual struggle, and Zooey's countinued talks made this a great book, that I reccomend for anyone to read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey were too tender to obsessively focus on intellectual/spiritual realities as they did. My feeling as I read with great interest (on several occasions) the intelligent and honest exchange was sadness that they were so obviously moving relentlessly to a tragic outcome."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Perhaps I related to Franny at the time of my first reading. Subsequently, I have read it several times primarily for the humor. The bathroom scene between Zooey and his mother never fails to make me laugh. Reading this book is akin to listening to beautiful music or looking at a spectacular sunset because of the range of emotions felt and thoughts explored. I love the Glass family for the intelligence, love, laughter and suffering they shared. I wanted to be a part of that family; find a Zooey and marry him. As a smoker, the fact that all of them have a cigarette dangling from their lips at every waking moment gives us something in common. Now I must read again soon to determine how I've missed the fact that Franny was pregnant. This will take some convincing. This is a book that I encourage everyone to read and have given out many copies. I have to admit, the majority of people have found it kind of weird and do not understand my fascination with J.D. or this book. Oh but, buddy, the Fat Lady does and that's enough for me"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is one hell of a book, filled with mysticism and the human heart and the toll that our little worlds take upon each other. But I better read the thing again because nowhere in the book do I see that she's pregnant. She gets sick in there but I only remember it ending with Zooey's fat lady speech which was beautiful. I never thought I would have that much sympathy for rich beautiful intelligent wunderkinds, but I didn't see anywhere that she was pregnant"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"is it just me or did wes anderson create the royal tennenbaums after reading this book?"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"A warm calm, akin to the same feeling I had while reading Herman Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, swathed me while reading &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;. Both books are slight in length but not in content, and deal with restless youths caught in contemplation. &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, set in India, is a far cry from Salinger's Manhattan, but both locales appear to be appropriate settings for a search past life's phoniness, to the truths the world holds.As regular readers of this space will know, among my favourite literary themes are genius, loneliness, and obsession. &quot;Franny &amp; Zooey&quot; has all three in spades. The seven Glass children, all of whom inform the main characters in some way or another, were all tormented by their genius. Franny, stuck in a spiritual crisis, is only just realizing that she's alone in the world. And Zooey appears obsessed by the idea that his family, most notably his smothering mother and his oldest two brothers, has shaped him in such a way that he can't escape himself.Like Salinger's archetype angst-maestro, Holden Caulfield, Franny and Zooey both appear to be caught up in teen obsessions: questioning authority, judging those around them through a particularly narrow prism, and intent on wiling away their time caught up in self-discovery. The startling thing, though, is that Franny and Zooey are no longer in teen angst's main demographic. Franny, aged 20, and Zooey, 25, are adults, now. It's comforting to know of two peers (I'm 26 at this writing) still caught up in their same youthful questions, as I am myself. It makes me wonder if that old axiom -- &quot;If you're not a rebel by age 20, you have no heart; if you haven't sold out by age 30, you have no brain&quot; -- doesn't have to be true. Sure, it may not lead to a productive life, and, like Franny, there may be some psychological bumps along the way. But won't the end be much better? Assuming the answers are forthcoming.The above paragraph, although filled with self-satisfaction, can *too* be true while also being pretentious.'Franny', the shorter story that begins this collection, is a startling feat. It dances around the issue of Franny's mental breakdown, providing a multitude of clues as to why it must occur, but never knocking the reader over the head with cheap psychology. Although not explicitly written in his voice, the story is told through the eyes of Franny's boyfriend, Lane Coutell, a shallow and pompous college student, obsessed with having a perfect night on the town with a respectable girl. We see the signs of Franny's breakdown through Lane's narrow worldview. Just as he doesn't understand what is happening to her, we don't either. It's a neat little trick.Upon reflection, 'Franny' can be read as a prologue to 'Zooey', which takes place once Franny has returned to her family home in New York. Its introduction represents a neat bit of meta-fiction. Is it or isn't Buddy Glass commenting on the events surrounding his youngest brother and sister, and their domineering mother? Through Buddy's introduction, Salinger is able to make excuses for the rambling nature of the story to follow. For some, it's an excuse he needs to make. For me, I appreciate the little bit of self-reflexivity (which only really became trendy after 1955-57, the years the stories were published), but didn't need the author to warn me of his impending self-indulgence.What immediately follows is a miraculous and hilarious (and quite long) sequence where Zooey is trying to take a contemplative bath, but is constantly interrupted by his mother. Zooey is a fine creation: he has little or no ego control, spouting hateful and sarcastic rants at his mother, who may or may not deserve them. &quot;[Buddy] does everything else Seymour ever did -- or tries to. Why the hell doesn't he kill himself and be done with it?&quot; he asks at one point, in a furious attempt to cut to the chase, while cutting to the bone. It's family dysfunction at it's most brutal and, frankly, most honest.Zooey could have become a terribly loathsome character if he continued down this path, but he doesn't. His scenes with Franny are touching and familiar, showing a sibling relationship at its most poignant as they try to dialogue Socratically through her problems. There's an obvious affection between the two, and a true sense of playfulness, even in the face of trauma. When Zooey wakes Franny from a depression induced nap, she is disoriented enough to ask why it is so sunny in the middle of the afternoon. Zooey replies: &quot;I bring the sun wherever I go, buddy.&quot; I just love that little line, because it manages to say so much with so little.Which is, I guess, the essence of Salinger. When one can write as economically and yet as profound as he can, I'll follow him down any path he chooses, for as long as he chooses. In fact, I could have spent a lot more time with Franny and Zooey than he deigned to give me."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"yes, curse him.he reminds me of one of those alogether fancy dining places, where you receive the most wonderful tasting things you have ever dreamed of devouring, and yes, they appear in the right portions, and leave you satisfied when done...but oh, to continue to eat them over and over, for all eternitythat is how i feel about salingerthe man takes the first 40 or so pages, franny, to describe basically an incident of eating lunch, which foreshadows the later portion of the book.however, in forty pages, he is realistically describing for the most part, about a half hours worth of time, and it is all enthralling.gladly gladly would i read this book again, just as i am set to soon embark on going back through catcher in the rye, and it occurs to me, much like that wonderfully delictable fare at the extravagant resturaunt, that as good as it is when you know what is coming, the element of surprise at salingers masterfullness can not be toppedanyone loving quality descriptive prose, needs to read this."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is a short book. In fact, it was originally published as two short stories in the New Yorker--\\"Franny\\" in 1955 and \\"Zooey\\" in 1957, and then published together in 1961. Franny and Zooey Glass are brother and sister--Franny's a 20-year old college student having a \\"nervous breakdown\\" as she explores Eastern religion, and Zooey's a 25-year-old actor who still lives at home. Bookending the two is the rest of the Glass family: the five other children, who we never met, and Mrs. Glass, who talks in italics.Salinger wasn't one for \\"action,\\" per se--there's a lot of saying, but not doing, in his novels. He tends to over-describe things--he even lists the entire contents of a medicine cabinet. Sometimes this can get long-winded and pointless, and it was easy for me to see why Catcher in the Rye overshadows this book. Franny and Zooey explore religion to a great extent in these stories, and their philosophizing went over my head in places. The dialogue is neurotic at times and fast-paced. Overall, not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"The Franny story is a scary account of someone coming unhinged made even more disturbing by her youth. Like Salinger's other two-tale collection, one feels like a real story with arc and all. The other seems unformed - rewarding nevertheless, but demanding of the reader's full attention."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I really enjoyed Salinger's novel Franny and Zooey more than Catcher in the Rye for which he is famous. This book leaves the reader a changed person. After reading this you question things like society, religion, education and your relationships with different people. I highly recommend this book and think it will open your mind to new ideas concerning things that many of us accept without questioning. I think Salinger's brillance comes across in this novel since he is able to make the reader greatly question and analzye themselves and their surroundings through his stories about the Glass family."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book brought in everything I've ever hoped for. There were ties of philosophy and theology with a modern-day story that it feel so rich and vibrant. To read this, I think you have to be prepared to not know what the plot is going to be. That's the only problem. If you really wanted to, you could read the last 14 pages and have a good grasp of what the entire book is about. However, i do not suggest doing that.Franny is the typical teenager looking for meaning in her life.Zooey is the typical twenty year-old who wants something in his life that he can be proud of.Both love each other, but both are going no where. It's the type of book where you just want to keep reading and i absolutely love it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book gave me a feeling, as another review put it, of familiarity. A lot of the philosophies or ways of thinking expressed by both Franny and Zooey reminded me a lot of thoughts that have often crossed my mind and the beliefs that have sprung from those thoughts. I'm actually supposed to write a review for this book in my Creative Writing class in HS. The assignment tells us to pretend that this is a book that has &quot;just been published&quot; and we are to tell whether it contends to modern-day life. I'd say that the subjects hit upon in this book are indeed time-less and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"J.D. Salinger writes in a style that leaves the reader hungry for each and every page. Two stories that keep the reader interested, focused and wanting more.My high school aged daughter had this title on her required reading list and I can see why.A truly gifted writer."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is an intriguing book that causes the reader to view the world in a different light. Although often criticized for being overly cynical and sarcastic, I found Zooey's sarcasm toward his mother amusing, adding a humorous touch to a somewhat depressing message. Salinger's cynicism sheds light into the reality of life-corruption is widespread, but an obsession with correcting it can be harmful. Franny demonstrated this point when she suffered a nervous breakdown, caused by her stress from school. The reader is able to relate to Franny's problems and, therefore, connects with the book. I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking to read a realistic story with a bit of sarcasm."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey was a good novel, but definitely very confusing. I found it interesting to read. It wasn't really a novel I liked, but wasn't one I disliked. It was originally 2 separate articles and was then turned into a book. I think that's why it was so confusing. The transition from the Franny article to the Zooey article wasn't very clear. I think the book teaches you about the insecurities and the obsession people can get when they become tied to some type of religion. The book wasn't very long, but it was very slow, some of the scenes were described very clearly, which made it quite long and sometimes boring. Overall, I would recommend this book, because it teaches you about the sarcasm and cynicism in a person."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"With these two stories, and especially &quot;Zooey&quot; (the longer one), Salinger ultimately presents an extremely rewarding message about the goodness in all people. However, he sure takes his sweet time to get there. I found it slow going getting through his manneristic writing (especially the endless scene where Mrs. Glass speaks to Zooey in the bathtub and simply won't shut up or leave.) I didn't find any of the dialog believable, and I didn't care very much about the characters either. Young people may enjoy the intellectual exercise of keeping track of the Glass family and their verbose meanderings, but I grew tired of it all. I'm glad I got to the end because the message there is indeed an important one, and helps justify the reading of these stories; they are not great, however. Salinger showed off his writing skills better in some of the Nine Stories."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book was given to me by a friend and I can't thank her enough for the gift it has been! I go back to Franny &amp; Zooey time and again for a gentle reminder when I've lost track of the meaning of life...so I'm saddened to read things like &quot;average&quot;, &quot;no meaning&quot;, &quot;waste of time&quot;, and &quot;phony&quot; in these reviews. It's nearly enough to make one contemplate poking a freshly sharpened #2 pencil RIGHT into her eyeball. And I just might do that...for the fat lady, of course.Granted, this book is full of seemingly unrelated vignettes, the major points can appear subtle at first glance, and Salinger invites the reader to come peek down some shadowy avenues with him along the way, so it's easy to get sidetracked or lose your focus. I'm convinced, though, that his writing style is intended to mirror the way Zooey's message to Franny is revealed..slowly and gently, so that she (and the readers) can grasp it for herself (ourselves). ! Try reading this book twice, even if you think you've &quot;gotten&quot; it the first time around. Salinger's genius virtually dances in every line of every page, if you only stick around long enough to see it. This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly - it illustrates (and in one line, no less) everything that lies at the core of all the world's religions. That's no small accomplishment."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I make no claim to possession of extensive literary insight nor capability, so I'll keep this brief. Coming at this fresh with the mindset of wondering \\"what does it all mean?\\", these stories are especially poignant. Without over analyzing things, Franny and Zooey strike me as personifications of the id and superego, respectively, in a mind on the brink of self destruction. I found Zooey's foiled attempt at impersonation of the ego (whom which Franny has proclaimed detest, yet ironically yearns to deliver counsel) utterly hysterical. OK, i'm probably off base. Just read the book. Especially if you are a tortured creative soul looking for insight into making sense of a brutish world."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"\\"Franny and Zooey\\" is a rather peculiar book that either makes it or breaks it for the reader. Salinger writes great dialogue, no questioning that. The reason I picked this up was because of Holden (Catcher in the Rye), who spoke with great honesty -- someone I felt was entirely believeable. Not here. Try as I may to connect with the characters, this book simply didn't work for me. In essence, the story revolves around a pair of over-philosophical siblings, proteges of sorts. Together with their other sibilings, they hosted a radio talk show called \\"It's a Wise Child\\" and ever since, had their egos blown out of proportion... well, more like disfigured actually because I ended up feeling rather sorry for their strange outlook in life. Franny despises her lecturers, the education system, even her boyfriend's aspiration -- and the worst part of it, she can't help it. If you thought that Holden hated phonies, wait till you hear it from this dynamic duo! Evidently, both of them owe their dysfunctional behavior to their eldest pair of brothers who \\"funnel\\"fed them with ideas greater than themselves early on in life. The characters over-analyze everything, nothing is pure. This book is a hard read -- it is teeming (and I mean TEEEEMING) with sarcasm, pronouncements, judgments, tactlessness, dark humor (and not entirely funny ones, I might add). I probably should give credit to Salinger for creating such conflicted characters (yeah, they were snobs, but they got a heart too -- like when Franny takes up the \\"Jesus Prayer\\" in search of spirituality and Zooey consoles his sister over the phone after tearing her down) but in the end, I couldn't agree more with Salinger when he admitted in the foreword to his editor, I quote \\"... I urge my editor, mentor and (heaven help him) my closest friend... to accept this pretty skimpy looking book\\". You said it, man. You said it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I loved re-reading Catcher in the Rye awhile back and when a couple of my friends recommended Franny and Zooey swearing it was better, I couldn't wait to get into it. It started fine with dramatic tension between the neurotic college girl Franny and her \\"Holden Caulfield like\\" college boyfriend Lane. Then it all derailed with a new character, Franny's brother Zooey (another Holden) and this painful long back and forth wih his mother about what to do with poor mixed-up sister Franny. I wanted to like this book, but oh well."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"In this work a great deal of Salinger's personal struggles are revealed, but the book is flawed in many ways. While his prose style is progressively refined, the author's views on religion are a startlingly confused hodgepodge. Franny's fascination with the Jesus Prayer of Eastern Orthodoxy is riveting, but the conclusions at the end of the book smack of New Age thought, which makes for a frustrating and ultimately unremarkable ending. The trouble lies in the mixture of Buddhist and Hindu thought with the teachings of Christianity, as if these ancient religions are easily interchangeable. The pantheistic idea that \\"God is everything and everything is God\\" is incorporated into Zooey's outlook on Christianity, overlooking the reality that pantheism has never been a Christian tenet. Finding God in everything may seem a comforting view at first, but then the philosophical problems of cruelty and ignorance rear up and shatter that notion. Detachment is not a Christian virtue, and leads only to more disillusionment. To wander through life hating and resenting everything and everyone, as Franny and Zooey do, will not give a religious seeker even an iota of contentment. The yoga of action without desire for action's fruits is a Hindu belief, not a Christian one. Taking the supposed best of every religion and rejecting the rest is the mark of New Age thought, which leads to a manic and consequently unappeasable thirst for happiness. Salinger himself struggled to find a religion, but was ultimately unsatisfied with every religion he tried. The Glass children's struggles are just a reflection of Salinger's (and perhaps the reader's) empty search for a tailor-made religion without any uncomfortable restrictions.The book is still highly readable, if you enjoy Salinger's prose, but the weak attempt at a conclusion is suspect, and can reasonably be discarded. If you are a religious person, you will probably find no substantive sentiments in this book, since they only scratch the surface of numerous world religions, and never delve deeper. If you find bumper-sticker-quality quotations inspiring, then perhaps this book is for you, but it is undoubtedly a flop as a journey toward enlightenment, heaven, or whatever Salinger thinks lies hidden from us."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is a book is an examination of religious fanaticism and how that obscures the real worship of God, an interesting idea whose time never passes. Franny is a college age kid who thinks that a constant prayer is the only way to find God. Zooey is her older and wiseacre brother who has some thoughts on that topic.Their family structure is a precursor to the family in the ROYAL TENEBAUMS, if you've seen the movie. The book is sharp and funny and even insightful. It would make a good stage play as most of the book is dialogue and it takes place in just two settings.If you are reading it as a follow up to CATCHER IN THE RYE, you'll get a different experience here. It is more talky whereas CATCHER was more of an adventure. I enjoyed Franny and Zooey, but probably more so after I had finished reading it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I enjoyed reading the backround to the Glass children, as well as the snappy dialouge between Zooey and his mother. However, it seems at times to drift off from two characters having a conversation to long winded comments on religion.Of Salinger's work I have read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot;Nine Stories&quot;, I'd recommend them both over this."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read the entire first part of the book and still had no idea what it was even about. It might be a good book for someone who is looking for a very deep book with a lot of descriptive language, but I found it to be a terrible and confusing read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Die-hard Salinger fans would pick this book up. I, regrettably, find the book exceedingly repetitive. The scant facts and hear-says about The Man are so re-used and re-cycled in articles after articles in this book. Save for the excerpts from Joyce Maynard's and Peggy Salinger's memoirs--which I am now interested to read, especially Maynard's--this book is a heap of junk."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book is good but very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very boring!!!"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"i honestly find this book very difficult to read, but also very interesting once you get the hang of it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"... Plus i enjoyed The Catcher In The Rye and To Esme With Love And Squalour so i thought i'd see if this one was up to the same standards. It tells the story of Franny and Zooey, brother and sister from a precocious family of radio stars. Franny seems to have a nervous breakdown and turns a bit religious, and spends much of the book lying on a couch crying and repeating \\"Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me\\" in an attempt to find spiritual fulfillment, while Zooey offers her his heartfelt advice. I didn't fancy this book much, I thought The Catcher In The Rye was a far superior portrayal of youthful alienation and dissatisfaction and the way the characters spoke was really irritating me by the end. Plus it was awful short. I like a book you can get stuck right into, not one that you can read in about an hour and a half. However if you're torn between watching crappy daytime TV and reading this book, you should definetely read the book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Whenever I worry that its all in vain, that there is no reason for it all, I smile for the fat lady."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"After reading Catcher in the Rye, Franny and Zooey was a surprise. It read like a play rather than a novel, but the characters were very strong and the portrait of the Glass family was quite engaging. I don't know if it is a reflection of the times, but boy I sure wanted everybody to stop smoking cigars and cigarettes, if only for a moment. Was that some kind of intentional device? Anyway, very well done if rather unexpected. I would have like to read more about the family dynamics, with the angst a bit toned down."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Although there is very little plot in the story, there is such a phenomenal amount of character and insight that the story is not dull. The story revolves around the relationship of a family of brothers and sisters in New York, though it mainly focuses on the two youngest siblings. The girl, Franny, is going through an emotional breakdown, and her mother enlists the help of her slightly older brother, Zooey. The novel is very Salinger and the dialogue is fantastic, but the core of Franny's troubles lie in her religious discontent. Being nonreligious, this could have spoiled the book for me if Salinger did not work such an intricate relation between the brother and sister. The book is not preaching, but would have been better without the religious aspects. Although the aspect Salinger does touch upon is an interesting one. Overall, it is a beautiful story, filled with the angst of a young girl, her relationship with her family, and her problems with society, a popular theme in Salinger's books. If you do not focus on the religious dilemna's, the beauty of the inner story can be seen. For those who are deeply religious, I can only say that it will probably be helpful in clarifying any issues you have within yourself."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is one of my favorite Salinger books.

SalingerReview by:Fred ShiraI read all of Salinger's work, he was not that prolific, back in the 1960's for a couple of reasons: one, it was the hip thing to do, and two, it was the hip thing to talk about when trying to pick up girls. \\"Have you read such and such by Salinger; isn't it just great. How he speaks to our inner being\\". Inner beings were a big thing in those days. This was in Washington D.C. where the wide eyed girls from across the country came to find husbands.I have wondered why Salinger became such a hermit, living a life way out of the public eye. Maybe it was because of his books. The Catcher in the Rye is a good book and should be required reading for all fifteen year olds. Maybe the roar of the literary dollar harkened to him to keep writing and we, little intellects as we are, will keep buying. When ole' J.D. passed away I thought it might be a good idea to reread some of his work, so I rummaged through the boxes in the attic and found a copy of Franny and Zooey thinking this would be a good place to start, now I think it is also a good place to stop.Franny and Zooey is a snapshot of two characters looking for a story. It is divided into two sections appropriately named, first Franny and then Zooey. It's not a long book, a mere 202 pages, and it could probably be pared in half by taking out all the superfluous descriptions and verbiage padding.The first section finds us at a New England college on the day of the big Yale game. Franny, a spoiled little rich girl, comes to town to meet her boy friend whose main concern is a paper he wrote about Flaubert for an English class and is disappointed that no one wants to read it. The first scene is set with Lane, that's the boyfriend, setting on a train platform waiting for Franny to arrive in a Burberry raincoat. I have to wonder if he got a coat for the product placement.After Franny arrives they go to a restaurant where the conversation turns to snails, how they are so above everyone else and chicken sandwiches. Franny relates to Lane that she has read a book about a monk who went around saying the \\"Jesus Prayer\\" like a Buddhist mantra. She plans to follow suit to find true enlightenment. Franny then refuses to eat the chicken sandwich which Lane cajoled her into ordering, and then she faints. End of story number one. The one point of tension is when Lane hints that they may have sex if he can find a back way into the Franny's room.The second story is Zooey. After Franny comes to she goes home to the home of her parents in upper east-side Manhattan. He we meet the Glass family which dominates Salinger's later writings, as a matter of fact all his writings, except for Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye. We learn that there were seven Glass kids. They were all contestants on a radio quiz show, \\"It's a Wise Child. All gifted. Zooey is a TV actor who criticizes everything and everybody he comes in contact with.The first half of the story is a dialogue between Zooey and his mother, who he calls Bessie, in the bath room. Poor Zooey has to take his bath hiding himself behind a curtain while his mother sits and smokes. Salinger sets the scene for us like he is being paid by the word. He even goes so far to describe every item in the medicine cabinet. Bess wants Zooey to bring Franny out of her doldrums and make her eat some chicken soup, Jewish penicillin, even though the Glasses are Catholic.The second half of the story is a very long diatribe where Zooey tries to explain the essence of Eastern mysticism with Franny laying on the couch lamenting the fact that in her four years of college she has only heard the term, \\"wise man\\" once, and that was pertaining to some guy who made a lot of money, such a Philistine.To make an overly long story short; its girl has a spiritual crisis, brother helps her understand, girl gets better. The only real action in the story is that everyone is always lighting cigarettes, except for Zooey who smokes cigars, and moving ashtrays around. Smoking was very chic in the fifties when this story was set.Perhaps there is more to this story when you look deeper. Does the name Glass signify some sort of transparency? Does Zooey go through some sort of metamorphous when he returns to his room and changes his sweaty shirt? Do the two older brothers, Buddy and Seymour stand for some abstract spiritual power figures? This could all be so, but the book is too droll to think that much about. When it's finished you just want to put it back in the box in the attic,Maybe Salinger should have followed the lead of Harper Lee and Margaret Mitchell and wrote one good book then quit."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"The book is in fine condition, as described, and arrived in a timely fashion. Very satisfied."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"There's a remarkable thing about everything Salinger wrote: his works can be analyzed, broken down, de-symbolized, but they will still resonate with us on some level that makes no sense. Take this book, Franny and Zooey as an example. One of the most transcendent passages of all time is in the last couple of pages in this book, and at the very end, it is revealed to us that not only must we do everything for the Fat Lady, who most likely has cancer and blasts the radio all day, every single person is the Fat Lady. Anybody we hate, love, despise, admire- they are the Fat Lady. And the Fat Lady is Jesus.I don't know; how can you explain Salinger? All I can tell you is that this book will change, in a tiny, inscrutable way, how you see the world. It will open your eyes to things you didn't know existed. You have to read this book. It is, at its most fundamental, a story of what it is to be human."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"People tend to disapear in Salinger's works, which makes the author's literary exile that much more ironic, if not compelling. Franny, the youngest of two females in the Glass family, is about to disappear, into the back of her parent's couch, during her 'spiritual crisis'. What keeps Franny from being self-involved, is that she is so concerned with humanity on a religious level, and that her ambivalence stems not from her thinking she is morally superior, but conversely, that she feels just as hypocritical and shallow as the rest of humanity, and that she cannot transcend it.What makes Salinger so enjoyable, and important, is the hand's on, non-academic philosophy in his books, and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; is most indicative of that. The novel addresses the disparities between Christianity and Buddhism, Western and Eastern thought. Franny idolizes Jesus, he has become a rock star to a little girl, with his bare-chested starving and dying. Like Holden, she shuns the phony and the arrogant. Zooey, her older brother, bitter at Seymour and Buddy (the eldest Glass bothers) for 'brainwashing' the younger two at an early age, plays devil's advocate perhaps a little too harsh, telling Franny to get over it, that she too is hypocrite, just another ego attached to their beliefs.When Franny goes overboard with tears and derision, Zooey calls Franny on the phone, pretending that he's Buddy. Buddy's tone is more gentle, more understanding. He tells Franny to love God but not religion. &quot;Do it for the Fat Lady,&quot; He says. A sublime scene involving three family members and two voices. The Fat Lady is Jesus Christ himself- not the icon, not the ideology- but the mortal man who died and did not rise again.As secular as this last note may seem, readers will let go of the last page having just underwent a 'religios experience.'"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"With all due respect to Salinger fans, I found this lacking. The only entertaining thing, in my eyes, was the references to Jappam and the meditations. Still, as far as the &quot;story&quot; itself, there wasn't much of one.

If I wanted to experience the incessant nattering of people who are simultaneously this reprehensible and this boring, I'll watch reality television. I had to read or re-read three other fluff-novels to have enough mental reserves to finish this.I do have to thank this book for one thing, though.

And this is why its so hard for me to tell you all that F & Z is not a worthwhile project, even if you can disengage yourself from Catcher Comparison (but let's face it, we're all only human).If you're interested in religions, especially eastern meditation and that kind of thing, maybe you'd have more luck than i did. I just couldn't make myself like Zooey. The dialogue is so tedious, too. Salinger describes in pedantic detail each nuance in a conversation which doesn't have interesting content to start with. I wasn't a fan of the whole bath thing, either - an entire third of this book takes place in the bath, and a long portion of that time is Zooey reading a loooong boring letter. I didn't find it an interesting comment on life in the forties - i couldn't relate to it in any way, and the entire situation felt contrived and tedious.A good sign of not enjoying a book is when its only just over a hundred pages long, and it feels longer than reading Anna Karenina (which i quite enjoyed, btw - check that one out - its Tolstoy's other famous novel).For a hundred and twenty pages, remarkably little of importance happens in this story. Salinger seems to have had nothing to say, so to make up for it he decided he'd take as long as possible to not say it.I'm sorry, J.D - i was once your biggest fan..."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and zooeyThis book consists of two short stories about members of the Glass family. The members of this family are actors and actresses from New York and they used to be intelligent people who appeared on a radio.

Indeed, Salinger did not write this book; rather, this book wrote him, scribbling the despairs of the nuclear family deep on his soggy innards, leaving tattoos on his entrails that he could only escape via the cottage portal that leads into solitary confinement. There, he waits for his own personal Godot.This vibrant family drama sees two members of The Glass Family ---Franny and Zooey, duh --- breaking the pseudo-earnestful binds that their Vaudevillian parents strapped them in. Upon learning that his younger sister Franny (duh) has suffered a nervous breakdown, Zooey reacts with inappropriate slapstick charades: smoking in the bathtub, playing with the items in the family medicine cabinet, and talking with his mother while only half-dressed.Yet Zooey snaps out of his demeaning spell, and takes charge as Franny's fugle, her heroic knight. By calling Franny on the phone and disguising his voice as that of an older brother, Zooey heals his sister's possessed soul; while the disguised voice may read like betrayal to many, Zooey both practices the art of exorcism (while Salinger tries to comes off like an intellect, this story makes it easy to see that he thought Franny was possessed, which reveals another possible explanation for Salinger's reluctance to go out in public: he is not scared of papparazzis, but he just might be afraid of ghosts). This rescue brings up subtle ancient ritual visions of carnal love between siblings, but pulls out just in time, cleverly keeping this work from becoming outright pornography (which is the literary world's loss).Zooey is also prophesying the arrival of the 900 phone number here, calling for false voices, who --like sirens,--- aurally seduce the desperate folk longing for love. These puzzling but necessary visions make this book a classic both in contemporary literature and subliminal Wiccan erotica (the good kind of Wiccans, not the bad or mean ones that hurt people and animals)."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I first read this a few years ago, and, back then, it was just a driveling story about two elitist people talking about how they are better than everybody. I decided a couple weeks ago to pick this book up again. This is social commentary at its best, and it was written more than 50 years ago and still applies today. This is at least as good as The Catcher in the Rye! Read it more than once to get the most out of it like I did. HIGHLY recommended little book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Readers' reactions to this book seem to depend upon whether they can identify with, or understand, people like the Glass children. Are deeply religious or philosophical issues important to you, or not? Do you, or do you not, wish to enter the conversation with the author/characters? I know some readers who cannot imagine that there are actually people like Franny in today's world. \\"People like that don't really exist!\\" See some of the reviews below - reading about religious issues is \\"boring in a work of fiction\\". Naturally, if you think so you would not likely enjoy this book. However, if you are such a person as Franny, and I assure you such people do exist and walk among you, then you may find it captivating. I cannot give a better description of the book than the review by Mr. Maynez - how can we live an ethical life? If such a question is important to you then I would definitely recommend the book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This little book packs quite a big punch of witty descriptions and thought-provoking dialogue in a succinct but moving religiously themed novel.Not much happens plot-wise throughout the 200 or so pages of \\"Franny and Zooey.\\" Instead, the book is set on a foundation of a few excellent character interactions: first between Franny, a college student, and her boyfriend; then between Zooey, Franny's older brother, and their mother; and finally between Franny and Zooey. I simply love the way Salinger paints his characters and their surroundings: he's perfectly precise when he has to be, but skillfully indeterminate the rest of the time, allowing the reader to actively engage the book by creating a visual and audio picture of what is going on.While the book is religiously involved, it is absolutely accessible to non-religious people. In fact, Salinger does an excellent job of incorporating religions from all corners of the world in \\"Franny and Zooey,\\" making this novel enlightening on multiple levels.This book comes with a high recommendation. It was a breath of fresh air in my lineup of fiction and definitely a satisfactory find."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I had found this book and fell in love instantly. I have always been a JD Salinger fan especially after reading \\"The Catcher on the rye\\". Salingers writing style has always been something I've admired.

One of my favorites part of this book is a conversation where Zooey and his mother are in the bathroom and she won't leave so Zooey can finish his bath. The conversation between the two is wonderful. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"For the most part, the setting for Franny and Zooey is limited to a train station, a restaurant and a Manhattan apartment. It is a story about the Glass family, of which Franny and Zooey are the two youngest siblings. If you've already read Catcher In The RyeThe Catcher in the Rye, you'll immediately pick up on similar themes, particularly when Franny is speaking. The frustration with phoniness, especially collegiate/pop culture phoniness is here in earnest, but it's expanded and fleshed out and placed in a distinctly religious context for much of the book. Buddhism and Christianity are swirled together throughout the story like fudge ripple ice cream. It's almost impossible to take a bite without getting some of both. Franny and Zooey (originally published as two separate works in the New Yorker) was written at about the same time that Kerouac was Dharma BummingThe Dharma Bums (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)about the West and you can feel the beat influence 3,000 miles away in the Glass living room.This novel is an enormous, far-ranging conversation with potentially eternal implications. The brother and sister are both freaks in a sense, much like Holden was, and two of their older siblings have already tragically passed away. They are not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill young adults. Both their DNA and their upbringing precluded that eventuality. Even if the reader doesn't buy the risk of damnation, it is impossible to deny that Franny and Zooey's sanity and potentially their lives themselves are at stake. Not every antagonist busts through the front door or waits for us down a dark alley. Sometimes, they are an aspect of our own psyche which threatens us from within like a synaptic Trojan Horse. Even without the spiritual/philosophical/psychological struggles, however, the conversations would make the book worth reading in and of themselves. They are erudite, profane, imaginative, shrill, sarcastic, witty and entirely entertaining. They make you laugh in spite of their tragic underpinnings.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey portray's the two youngest siblings of a large and somewhat broken (by tragedy, not by divorce) family who are both struggling in their own ways to define themselves in this world. They come from a family that seems almost genetically predispositioned for intelligence and deep intraspection, yet this natural depth leaves these two young adults unable to feel at one with the world as they perceive it. There is a resolution at the end of this novel, and it is not in the typical Salinger style that readers of Catcher in the Rye may expect. This is a wonderful book that is so easy and quick to read, but, most importantly, so many of us can relate to these characters, and can truly become wrapped up in the message behind this classic work."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Going into this book as a fan of \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" the reader will inevitably compare the two books as well as compare the main characters Franny and Zooey to Holden. If the reader is looking for another \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" it is not here. Though the two books contain many of the same themes and have similar styles, they greatly differ, mostly because of their structures. \\"Franny and Zooey\\" includes two short stores originally published in \\"The New Yorker.\\" While both stories about Franny and her breakdown, they are two separate entities. The stories lack the union and flow of a novel and are better seen as two separate short stories. As short stories, they are successful, but the reader will not find a unified novel with a beginning, middle, and end.Where Salinger is most successful is in the characters that he creates in this book. Franny is introduced in the first short story, in which she goes to Yale to meet her boyfriend and gradually becomes unglued as they eat dinner together. She brings to mind Holden Caulfield and his disdain for \\"phoniness\\", but she is also very reminiscent of Sylvia Plath in \\"The Bell Jar\\" because it shows a college girl slowly slipping into the confusion of a nervous breakdown. Like Holden, Franny is very relatable, especially to young people. Lane, Franny's preppy and pretentious boyfriend, is another character that feels very real. Salinger does an excellent job at highlighting Lane's arrogant attitude, and by sitting him across from Franny he is able to show the exact kind of person that Franny despises. In the second part of the book readers are introduced to Franny's older brother Zooey and their mother, Mrs. Glass. Zooey is portrayed as self-righteous and at times condescending, but he is also very concerned for his sister. Mrs. Glass is a very relatable mother figure, as she wants to help her daughter but really no idea how. She incessantly pesters Franny to eat something, and constantly complains about the painters needing to get into the living room. In these stories Salinger is very successful in making the reader feel like he or she really knows Franny, Zooey, Lane, and Mrs. Glass through his excellent character development.Fans of Salinger who are familiar of his writing style will not be let down with these pieces. Both parts of the book are compromised mostly with dialogue with little action or plot, especially the second story. The second part does seem to drag on at parts as Zooey tries to teach Franny that her knew religious philosophy of praying incessantly is not necessary. Though it does seem repetitive at times, this dialogue is so full of philosophical insight that it is worth it to get through. I would not recommend the book to somebody who is unfamiliar with Salinger, but any fan of Salinger's style and characters would enjoy the book. Also, as I said before, it is helpful to go into the book seeing it as two short stories, rather than a full novel."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"J. D. Salinger has a knack about puzzling his readers to the very end of the book and redeems himself with transcendent concluding remarks. \\"Franny and Zooey\\" does not possess much surface appeal as the more known \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". The book does not really follow a conventional plot and is thus deprived of any suspense and climax. It is rather a crafted delineation of human emotions, nuances and layers of the relationships between adult siblings. Salinger, putting his arguments in the mouth of Franny and her brother Zooey, addresses the disparities between Christianity and Buddhism and the convergence of Eastern and Western thoughts.Franny, 20, the youngest of the Glass children, is about to drop out from college as she feels sick of pedants and conceited egos. She desires to be spiritual and to pray incessantly to Jesus whom she later on out of frustration deserts for Buddhism. Franny experiences a spiritual crisis that leads to her nervous breakdown. She feels just as shallow and hypocritical as the rest of humanity.Zooey, 25, a handsome aspiring actor, is an underachiever in the standard of the Glass family. His eldest brother Seymour had a doctoral degree but committed suicide during his vacation in Florida. His next elder brother Buddy cajoles him to obtain a doctoral degree just so he has something to fall back to if the show business doesn't work out. In helping Franny to snap out of her crisis, Zooey's bitterness toward his elder brothers inevitably surfaces that out of jaundice he expressions his feeling like being haunted by a house-full of ghost and half-dead ghost (since Buddy follows Seymour's model but he doesn't commit suicide).At various points of the book am I stuck with doubts and unanswered questions regarding Franny's sufferings. To say the least even though the book touches upon some religious overtones but the core of which revolves around the idea of human ego, detachment, harmony and temperance. The novel affords a snapshot of how elder adult siblings can significantly influence their younger siblings at an early stage and formulate their mind.

I loved Zooey in this book. He is basically a genius, and evenmore a genius who knows his faults,(which I believe is the best kind of person)even at the age of 25. The story can relate to many young persons' years of confusion. It does overexemplify this confusion by way of Franny leaning toward slightly fanatical religious views.

At the time it was by far the best literary work that I had ever laid my eyes on.Fast forward 2 years later... I'm walking around a used book store and decide to see what else Mr. Salinger had to offer. The only book by Salinger in the store was Franny and Zooey. I snatched that bad boy up, paid for it, and eagerly cracked it open as soon as I got home. I read the whole Franny part straight through and was shockingly not entertained. It wasn't the worst thing I had ever read but it was certainly not in the same league of Catcher In The Rye. So I immediately continued on to the Zooey portion of the book. This is where the letdown came in. I didn't like this portion of the book at all. There was lots of talking that didn't really seem to go anywhere. I was bored out of my mind trying to finish the book.Bottomline is that if you liked the style of Catcher and want more of the same then don't bother with this one because the two are hardly similar at all. I haven't read anything else by Salinger (I was planning to but the letdown of this book has made me quite reluctant to do so) so I can't speak for the rest of his books but I do not recommend this on at all.Given that I read this book 2 years ago, I have told myself that I'd give it another read through to see if my opinion differs any but I haven't been able to bring myself to do it yet.

Billed by many critics as two stories I find it more fitting to describe the text as a novella in two parts. One-fifth of the way into Franny and Zooey, the narrator steps directly into the novel to establish, among other things, the narrative contract with the reader. In this section the narrator all but introduces himself as Buddy, the oldest living of the seven children of Bessie and Les Glass. Zooey and Franny Glass are the youngest of these children. This lucid contract with the reader belies the narrative complexities of the novella. The final scene of Franny and Zooey, while the siblings speak to each other on separate phone lines just one room away from each other, is one of my favorite, and one of the most moving scenes in all of literature."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Here is a classic book that will always be funny and never go out of style to read. The two novellas are easily read as one because they intertwine together. You need to read Franny to understanding Zooey and their quirky New York family. The laugh out loud parts often involve the mother who as annoying as she might be reminds us that all of our families are unusual and quirky. It's a painless introduction to Salinger in that it can be read in a few short sittings and it does make you want to read more about the Glass family escapades."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Symbolized through the Jesus Prayer, Salinger portrays the &quot;phoniness&quot; of the cultural church, whose chief objective is to serve as an escape from the fear of our existential dilemma. True faith, as Kierkegaard would say entails letting go of the illusions and discovering Christ the person. And as Zooey points out we do this not by trying to escape God's world, but by embracing it. &quot;In so much as you do for others (acting) you do for me&quot;."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"..I gotta admit, I felt like slugging both Franny and Zooey in the face. Extensive self-analysis is gods way of telling you that you have too much money"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If the ertswhile &quot;Pencey Prep student&quot; had bothered to do his homework, he would've realized that &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; is in no way a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;Catcher in the Rye', at least not narratively. It involves a different set of Salinger's characters, the Glass family, although the theme of resisting hypocrisy and phoniness which runs through &quot;Catcher&quot; also imprints itself on &quot;F&amp;Z&quot;. I think it's Salinger's most readable and captivating book, and the precocious Glass siblings aren't any more &quot;self-indulgent&quot; or neurotic than Holden Caulfield in &quot;Catcher&quot;. There's truths in these stories which transcend their particular milieus."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I am an avid J.D. Salinger fan--right now I'm in the middle of reading Nine Stories. However, the book that turned me on to J.D. Salinger was NOT Catcher in the Rye, as most people experience, but this book--Franny and Zooey. It is so simple yet so complete. J.D. Salinger's writing style is something I have fallen in love with, and this book, one of my favorites ever, gives me some sort of faith in families, in life, in God. It is quite an amazing book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Salinger sums up all the lessons of life, religion, and mysticism into a tiny package that is worth everyone's time. But, to fully enjoy and understand this book, one should first read The Pilgrim's Way, which is the backbone to this classic."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If you can ignore the circa 1950's preoccupation with post WW II literature and media, as well as the widespread and annoying tobacco abuse, this book is a timeless classic. Frannie is Struggling With Life's Big Questions, and turns to the Jesus Prayer. Zooey's dialogue with his sister Frannie packs centuries of religious insight and reconciles the Prayer and the search for the purpose of life with our modern age. It may be low calorie Religion, but it makes its point. The close of the book has the sublime clarity of one hand clapping.Salinger's style of writing is pure joy for the reader. He weaves his sentences with images and anecdotes - literary detours that not only amuse, but clarify. How can the author of such a compelling work turn out to be such a misanthrope?"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Reading this book may just start a lifelong obsession with the Glass family - represented here by Franny and Zooey. Franny becomes obsessed with the idea of &quot;Praying without Ceasing,&quot; an idea she picks up in a book about a Russian pilgrim who is trying to perfect the art. Each story takes a different look at the path of the ordinary (though many would argue that no member of the Glass family is ordinary) person's attempt to attain spiritual enlightenment. Franny is a perfect story all by itself; do yourself a favor and read it slowly. Then put the book away for several months and read Zooey. It too will strike you, not only with the profound spiritualism of the characters, but also with the sheer humor that pervades. Each time I reread this book, I am struck anew with how terribly funny it is. I'm going to be one of those tiresome people who wishes that they could be one of the Glass family members. Ah, J.D., let me read more about them! I still don't understand."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Anyone can see themselves in the characters of Franny and/or Zooey. In Franny, we have the hopeless romantic looking for faith, while Zooey cuts through this with a realistic sword. Zooey is the ego and the sharp witty intellect we aspire to every day, while Franny is the beautiful, fragile, and judgemental being we all protect from the outside world. She is Gatsby's Daisy if Daisy was really worthy of his attention. There is a line in the letter from Buddy that immediately struck a chord with me for it sums up what I hope that anyone I come into contact with actually takes with them from our encounter and I believe that it is applicable to all. &quot;Although my passes at omniscence may seem ridiculous, please be kind to the side of me that comes out as merely clever.&quot; paraphrase - I'm at work. This book reads like a letter from an old friend who made you mad for always being right. In the end, the moral of the story is tolerance and understanding and maybe that these two characters can cohabitate inside each and every one of us. READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read this aloud with my husband and enjoyed the funny banter and the arguments and blistering speech. But the end was really the beauty of the book. Before that, I felt a little like I was just speeding along confused about the destination...I didn't think it was as compelling as &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; though there were many similarities that I liked and was drawn to: The relationship between the sister (Franny) and the brother (Zooey) was similar to that between Holden and Phoebe Caulfield, and, of course, the colloquial tone and the means of telling most of the story either through talking or the conceit of talking to the reader was so enjoyable, particularly read aloud. We took a while to get through it though, due to travel schedules, etc., and I think that letting it sit was a mistake; I think it lost some of its intensity because it wasn't read quickly. While reading it aloud was really fun, I think it would be equally enjoyable to hole-up with it for a day or weekend and get the whole effect of the conversations quickly following on one another in &quot;real time,&quot; so to speak.That said, I thought it was really beautiful at the end, and I kind of got a little catch in my throat as I read the conclusion. Zooey (rhymes with Louie, so I've been told) really loves his sister dearly and her crisis of faith is a crisis for him, too. Its resolution is one of the precious moments when you have a small insight into being really loved. Experiencing that kind of familial closeness was really enriching, I thought. The way Salinger brings it together was quite poetic and moving. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"A young woman asks, \\"Isn't there more than this?\\" \\"Perhaps not,\\" her brother answers, \\"but does there need to be?\\" While not taken from the book, this exchange briefly summarizes this discursive intellectual thought-piece from J.D. Salinger. Comprised of two stories that were published separately in \\"The New Yorker\\" during the mid-fifties, the transition to \`novel' was never entirely completed, but this book about two college-age siblings and their search for fulfillment is certainly not without appeal.The first story, \\"Franny\\" reads like a comedy of manners focusing on the Ivy League college crowd of the 1950's. Franny and her boyfriend Lane are two bright young intellectuals, with comfortable backgrounds and brilliant futures who go on about the Yale Game, and their course work, and their academic advisors, etc.., ad nauseum, in more than enough detail to make us feel like we're right there in the restaurant with them. But it soon transpires that Franny is no more interested in their insipid chatter than we are. Questioning the value of her studies, the wisdom of her teachers, and the ability of her fellow students, Franny is only going through the motions of her day to day life. Her dissatisfaction comes to a head when she passes out at the restaurant.The sequel, \\"Zooey\\" reveals that Franny is a member of the celebrated Glass family, and finds her ensconced with her mother, brother, and cat in the family's New York apartment. At this point the narrator, older brother Buddy Glass rears his unwelcome head and dominates the rest of the book. Unwelcome, because Salinger loses his artistic distance and allows the material to become cloying. To wit: all 7 or so Glass siblings were child prodigies of encyclopedic knowledge, talent, creativity, and religious wisdom; they all grew to love each other very much, including their parents, and all of them are either successful or dead or both. Buddy's adoration of his family smothers us, and becomes the whole focus of the story. We don't get into the other characters' heads nearly as much as we get into the narrator's. We see every little detail of the story played out, with plenty of voice-overs to ensure that we don't miss the significance of a single detail. Meanwhile, Franny sleeps through the middle section, and Lane is completely abandoned.But despite the skill with which Salinger portrays teenage alienation, this book is not likely to play well with anyone who is not a white, middle-class intellectual; if you're not a Glass, you don't belong here. This story is just a gentle reminder that even during peacetime, young people can find reasons to be upset with the system - it goes with the territory. Teens who are into self-discovery should find resonance with their own feelings - they're certainly the target audience - but its doubtful that today's young intellectuals see nothing more to be critical of than their professors' affectations. A document of a simpler, more homogenous era."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"In a nutshell - offspring who are too intelligent for their own good, oblivious parents, suicide, meaning of life, nervous breakdown, our purpose, and references like being an arhat thrown in here and there. It all felt very personal and familiar and made me wonder how many other people would find that these two stories hit close to home.I should mention that I just discovered recently that this is my brothers favorite book (and he's no &quot;phony&quot;). I wouldn't rate it as my favorite, but I do have an affinity with this text, having now read it twice, once as a teenager and now as a thirtysomething.Salinger describes this work in the preface as &quot;a pretty skimpy looking book&quot;. It's certainly short, but both stories are funny and addresses how a family - albeit highly dysfunctional by today's pop-psychology standards - deals with issues like death and suicide.I really enjoyed the interplay in the second story between brother and sister Franny and Zooey over big questions like the search for wisdom, being real and losing the ego."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Fans of Salinger might disagree with my personal opinion on this book, but I think I'm giving a completely accurate and fair review when I make this statement: If you're a big fan of the author, you'll probably enjoy this book, but if you're not a big fan, or you just prefer novels to short stories, then you will probably not be impressed.This book consist of two short stories that were originally published in a magazine. Both stories are about members of the Glass family, a fictional family that appears in many of Salinger's short stories. The first story describes a date between Franny, the youngest of the Glass children, and her boyfriend Lane, a student at a New England college. Even though the story was written in the fifties, anyone who reads it will probably associate Lane with someone they know. He's pretentious, self-absorbed, and arrogant. He's the type of guy who takes pleasure in criticizing something just for the sake of being different, while at the same time attempting to prove his own intelligence. Like many of Salinger's characters, Franny has become disenchanted with society and she's suddenly offended by Lane's behavior and his views. We eventually learn that she's had this change of heart after reading a novel about a poor pilgrim who finds purpose through religion. \\"Franny\\" is the shorter of the two stories, and it's extremely well-written. Salinger does an excellent job of creating a character that any reader can understand, and he creates an environment that is still relevant today, fifty years later.\\"Zooey\\" is the second story, and it is set two days after the first. The title character is one of Franny's older brother, and it focuses on conversations between Zooey, his mother, and Franny.Zooey is another excellent character. Just through his words, the author does an excellent job of giving the character depth. Again, Zooey is someone that most people might recognize from their own life. He's intelligent, attractive, and think he's know what's best for everyone. Though he attempts to be humble, it's just not in his nature. The majority of the story deals with Zooey's attempts to help Franny understand the book she's read and once again find some purpose in everyday life, although he often allows his own ego to get in the way and resorts to forcing his opinions on Franny rather than giving good advice.I didn't like this story as well as the first. While the dialog was great at times, it also had a tendency to drag on for too long. In fact, the entire story seemed a bit too long. It's hard to tell what Salinger was trying to accomplish. Perhaps he was just painting a portrait of troubled, confused youths, but I don't think that's the case. Too often it feels like the Zooey character is a reflection of Salinger himself, and that story's only purpose is to serve as a means for the author to impress the reader with his own knowledge and opinions on religion and the purpose of life, not to mention his own cynical views of the people who don't share his wisdom. Of course, other's might find something more profound from the story."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"J.D. Salinger will always be remembered for &quot;A Catcher in the Rye,&quot; just as Bing Crosby will always be known for &quot;White Christmas&quot;; while Crosby starred in many movies, Salinger produced scant few other works. Fans of Salinger will want toread this book, non-fans will not.&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; is a book about three conversations. The first is between Franny and her boyfriend. They are in college and dating seriously. She has made some self-discovery that involves the 'Jesus prayer'. This prayer is something someone would say over and over and over until they eventually reach a state of enlightenment. Franny realizes she is not living an enlightened life and wonders the time honored question, &quot;What's it all about?&quot; The 'Jesus prayer' disrupts her relationship (I won't go into further detail). I will mention that Salinger takes some excellent 'shots' at academia within this first third of the book.The second conversation is between Zooey and their mother. (Franny and Zooey are brother/sister) He is a college grad who now works as a TV actor. For fans of Holden Caufield (The Catcher and the Rye) you will enjoy this part greatly. Zooey will seem to you much like a slightly older, worldlier, and equally sarcastic version of Holden. Zooey and his mother discuss many things, the most important of which is &quot;It's a Wise Child&quot;. &quot;It's a Wise Child&quot; was a radio quiz show where Franny, Zooey, and their siblings became stars because of their tremendous intellect. We learn a great deal about the family and their raising in this, the middle third of the book.The ultimate conversation is between Franny and Zooey themselves. By this point Franny is back at home, depressed, ailing, and with other complications I should not spoil. Now the topic of conversation is about both their upbringing and the Jesus prayer. Zooey is full of himself and of advice. Franny thinks she wants to give herself to the Jesus prayer, but she does not truly understand it. The twists at the end of this conversation make the book worth reading.If you are a reader looking for action, this book is not for you. If you enjoy Salinger and need more, then I do recommend it. It is interesting, but, well, it's no &quot;White Christmas&quot;"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I highly recommend the two stories &quot;Frannie&quot; and &quot;Zooey&quot;. The stories are complex, dealing with philosophy, psychology, and religion, but the simple, central, universal theme is love. Almost everyone can relate to the characters Zooey, Frannie, Lane, Bessie, Buddy, their father, etc. and either shares characteristics with them or knows someone who does. Criticizing others for being &quot;phony&quot; is not a happy way to live as Franny and her brother Zooey demonstrate. Everyone is &quot;phony&quot; in some way and has faults and flaws; that is why almost everyone who reads this book can relate to it. Too much cynicism and criticism is unhealthy. The simple way to combat them is to love; love people, yourself, life, etc. even if they are flawed. Buddy's fat lady is in all of us and epitomizes love. Salinger's work does not carry a new, radical, profound message; his true genuis is how he states it with very human characters and realistic insights that leave the reader saying &quot;Yes! I've felt that way before!&quot; &quot;I've read in the bath tub, and my mother disturbed me the whole time!&quot; &quot;I've felt lost at college when I couldn't decide what I wanted to do with the rest of my life!&quot; and so many others. These characters and dilemmas are timeless which truly marks oustanding literature."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I appreciate amazon. com's effort to give brief reviews of books so that people may browse, and find something that catches their fancy. What I don't like is the obvious fact that whoever wrote this reviewer obviously never read the book. At best they might have skimmed it. First thing, Franny is not pregnant. Her physical illness is a manafestation of her spiritual crisis. also she's not worried about her friends becoming housewives. Lastly, Zooey is not there simply to pester Franny. The book is just a wee bit deeper than that. Salinger is analyzing the form of function of religion, and also connecting it to the family structure, Zooey's comment about Franny not recognizing a bowl of &quot;consecrated&quot; chicken soup is one of the cornerstones of the novel. Jesus, or what ever spiritual entity you choose to identify with, in Salinger's opinion, is not just some abstract being sitting on high, looking down at us without caring. Instead, as one of the quotes on Seymour and Buddy's door says, &quot;I move not without thy knowledge.&quot; The Zooey story is one of the most important religious/philisophical works of the second half of the twentieth century. It ranks with Camus' The Plague as some of the best descriptions of the human condition. To trivialize it the way that the amazon.com review is a shame for fans of the book. More importantly, it might deny others the chance of discovering this boo"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"It is hard to believe that it is fifty years since this book appeared. I happened to be around then, and along with my sister who bought me the book eagerly rushed to read it then. I have read it more than one time since, and will write a few words about it without in any way attempting to be comprehensive or definitive. A very subjective few words.Salinger in this work is building the Glass family myth. This would be his central fiction for the major part of his publishing career post \\"The Catcher and the Rye\\" Along with the 'Franny and Zooey\\" there is the earlier \\"Nine Stories\\" which contains the first story about Seymour Glass, \\" A Perfect Day for Bananfish' something about Waker and Walt Glass, \\" Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut\\" and a story about Boo- Boo Glass Tannebaum,\\"Down at the Dinghy\\" Two more long stories published as one volume, \\" Seymour an Introduction\\" and \\"Raise High the Roof Beams Carpenter\\" were also published as one volume. And then there is the final story Salinger published before going silent, the long New Yorker tale( Hepworth) savaged by the Salinger critics. In this one the colloquial speech which is so much of Salinger's special appeal became overly- mannered kind of solipsistic discourse.All this is a long prelude to a few words about 'Franny and Zooey' The stories ostensibly have to do with the crises of two of the younger Glass family members. Franny's crisis relates to her relationship with the ' section- man Lane Coutrell' whose academic pretentious values mark him out as part of the kind of ' phony world' Salinger is always condemning. The actor Buddy too has his crisis relating to the mundane world of acting. The epiphany and final sentimental ending of the story which has to do with ' doing it for the Fat Lady' is Salinger's way of saying that despite all the sordid realities of realities there is no escaping if one wishes to be truly holy, from contending with everyday life and ordinary people.In the context and in the background is of course Salinger's creation of this family of geniuses, of oddball mystics, Jewish- Irish in origin who have a real flair and feeling for everyday American culture. The father Les has been an old vaudeville man and the mother Bessie softshoed with him on the old Pantages circuit.Along with creating the ring- ding authentic poet genius Seymour and the storywriter Buddy who is his ' amaneusis' Salinger gives us a picture of a lovable family who must deal with the everyday world, but somehow cannot. The great symbol of this is of course the family superstar, guru, oldest son, Seymour who commits suicide in 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish' a suicide not unconnected with the seemingly bourgeois, petty character of his wife and mother- in- law.'Franny and Zooey' has great Salinger dialogue and is wonderful in the whole feeling it gives of the Upper West Side special Glass- Salinger world. 'Manhatanee' and 'Salingerese' speak here at their best. But it also has that pretensiousness, that religious condescension, that simplicity of message( Go East young Westerners and be in touch with your true higher soul) which is at the heart of much of Salinger's work.In other words fifty years later aside from the Literature and the delight of the language and a world gone, all of which can be loved, there is a kind of criticism. I believe Salinger spiritually got it somehow wrong, and that this too relates to his continuing silence as a writer.But this does not detract from the special world he created and the pleasure of reading he has given to so many."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Whenever my life has taken a turn for the weird which I hadn't noticed, and I find myself needing the short route to my center, and perspective, I re-read this book.... (tens of times) I guess I've given away 200-300 copies over the course of my life... You must read it to the last page."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Wow! This one really blind sided me. I, of course, love The Catcher in the Rye, but when I tried reading Nine Stories, I was put off by them, so between that & his notorious silence, I just assumed Salinger was a one hit wonder. Still, he's got a birthday coming up (1/01/1919) and I found the book for a dollar, so I figured what the heck. Boy, am I glad.The book consists of two interconnected stories from the Glass family series, originally published in The New Yorker; Franny is the youngest sister, Zooey the youngest brother. All seven of the children were featured, each as they came of age, on a radio program called \\"It's a Wise Child\\", where:In general, listeners were divided into two, curiously restive camps: those who held that the Glasseswere a bunch of insufferably \\"superior\\" little bastards that should have been drowned or gassed atbirth, and those who held that they were bona-fide underage wits and savants, of an uncommon, ifunenviable, order.I wavered between these two opinions, though leaning towards insufferable, through the first story, Franny (1955), which concerns Franny's visit to her college boyfriend as she teeters on the edge of a breakdown, and the first three quarters of Zooey (1957), which opens with an extended scene featuring the visiting TV star Zooey taking a bath and arguing with his mother as she tries to convince him to help Franny, who is continuing her breakdown on the family couch, having abandoned acting class. It seemed that these characters were simply Holden Caufields a little farther along in life--precocious, bright and charming, but hypersensitive to the point of neuroses. But then all of a sudden, when Zooey does intervene, the story really takes off.Franny, who shares with Zooey and her other siblings (and with Holden Caufield) an exasperation with the inadequacies of all those around her and with the problems of the world in general, has become fascinated by the works of a Russian mystic who advocates endless repetition of a certain Jesus Prayer as a means of getting in touch with God. (...)This beautiful revelatory story is so suffused with empathy, humanity and spirituality, I had very nearly the same reaction as Franny. Zooey/Salinger has offered a way out of Franny's/Holden's/our' dilemma: the dissatisfaction with the seeming shortcomings of the world and the people around us. First, we must let go of our obsession with the failings of those around us; we can not be, nor should we try to be, catchers in the rye, trying to save or change everyone. Second, we must polish them for the Fat Lady; seek to live our lives perfectly, that we may be worthy of the audience, Christ Himself.If you have ever read and enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye, you owe it to yourself to read this book, an extended coda which, in effect, completes Holden's tale. It is one of the most moving and profoundly Christian works I've ever read. No wonder folks get so wound up at the thought of what Salinger has been writing during his extended silence.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny &amp; Zooey by J.D. Salinger examines the youngest children of the Glass family. Like their older brother, Seymour, made famous in Salinger's classic short story, A Perfect Day for Banana Fish and most of Salinger's children, they are gifted, precocious youths who have found ways to be miserable when faced with the task of growing up. While the Zooey, an actor and underachiever by Glass standards prefers to face his personal problems with a stubbornness and wittiness, his younger sister, Franny is waist deep in self-pity because she feels misunderstood and alone and can not find meaning in pretentious and phony upper class college life. Zooey is the perfect person to give Franny the tough love and show her the new perspectives to help her through her dilemmas and that's precisely what he tries to do one morning when he finds her in a weariness-induced sleep on their family couch. Although, it is not a book for readers bored by characters simply lounging around and talking (because that is precisely all they do), Franny and Zooey is a superb exploration of the relationships between adult siblings when they reluctantly leave the nest."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"J.D. Salinger's brilliant &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; is essentially a novella about a woman's quest for spiritual perfection. This book, approximately 200 pages in length, contains two sections (more like two fairly long chapters--the second much longer than the first) detailing Franny Glass' efforts to reach a higher spirtual plane, her subsequent breakdown, and her brother Zooey (Zachary) Glass' attempts to pull her out of her swoon.Part one, appropriately titled &quot;Franny&quot; begins with Franny's breakdown in a highscale restaurant with her literary-student boyfriend. The story unravels slowly (much like Franny) as details of what's causing the change in Franny are revealed. After reading about an itinerant Russian peasant's quest for ultimate spirituality (in two books from older brother Seymour's library) through incessant repetition of the Jesus Prayer (a reference to 1Th 5:17), Franny sets out to do the same with a concerted effort to continually mutter the prayer herself. Franny spends the meal railing against the desires and cravings of the well-to-do around her and has by all appearances undergone a drastic change of personality which ultimately results in her breakdown.Part two, titled &quot;Zooey&quot; picks up where part one lets off (for the most part). Franny returns home to the Glass house where she promptly refuses to eat and spends most of her time sleeping on the living room couch. This section of the novel (perhaps the most delightful 150 pages I have ever read) deals with Zooey's efforts to bring Franny back to reality. What makes this such a great book (aside from Salinger's way with words) is the dialogue between the various characters (only Franny, Zooey, and their mother, Bessie Glass make an appearance in part two). &quot;Zooey&quot; starts out with an amusing scene in Zooey's bathroom with an extremely amusing discussion between Zooey and Bessie regarding Franny's condition. Bessie urges Zooey to do something about it and ultimately Zooey agrees to talk to her. And talk to her he does. The dialogue between Zooey and Franny is equally engaging although instead of humor, it's tinged with an overt spirituality and love. Powerful and rapidly achieved, the conclusion to this story is simply beautiful. There's nothing more to say.A terrific book on many levels--a true classic every bit the equal of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; or &quot;Nine Stories&quot;--and not to be missed. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is an incredibly complex book for its brevity. Two inter-related stories take place in only five scenes, but the scale of the story and depth of the characters is much greater. Part of this is due to Salinger's uncanny ability to hit the nail on the head when it comes to young people coming to grips with the realities of the world and how they fit into it. In a few pages, we know the characters because we were the characters. We went through the same things they're going through. Whether it's Holden Caulfield in CATCHER IN THE RYE, or Franny Glass in this book, there's a little bit of us in the characters and a little of the characters in us.Franny and Zooey is about a teenage girl going through the crisis of finding herself and her brother coming to her aid as she borders on nervous breakdown. Franny and Zooey are the youngest of seven children, all geniuses and all showbiz prodigies. The first story, \\"Franny,\\" is a pretty straightforward scene of Franny's breakdown. It has smart dialogue and I absolutely love Franny by the end of it, but the real meat of this book comes with the second story.Some people have latched onto exactly what causes Franny's condition as the main question in the story. I thought it a more interesting question: Who is the narrator of \\"Zooey?\\" We are told early on that it is an elder brother, Buddy, but I'm not so sure we should take this at face value, especially considering Zooey's tendency to act and impersonate, as exemplified later in the story. Could Zooey possibly be the narrator, and how does that change our perception of the story?There is a line in \\"Zooey\\" that goes: \\"...all legitemate religious study must lead to unlearning the differences, the illusory differences between boys and girls, animals and stones, day and night, heat and cold.\\" This seemed one of the major themes of the book, one of the lessons Franny is learning. It also applies to a comparison between Franny and CATCHER's Holden Caulfield. There's more in common between people, things, etc., than one may think. Sometimes it just takes a higher viewpoint.This is a great book for a lit class, with many questions for discussion. Zooey's point, as he talks Franny out of her hole, that what motivates her-the quest for knowledge and enlightenment-is no different than than what motivates the people she looks down upon-those seekind money, fame, culture, property. With one swift stab, he pokes a hole in her stance of intellectual superiority. Whether one agrees with his argument or not, the dynamic between the younger, searching sister and older, slightly wiser brother is laced with insight and interest. A great, quick read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I guess I would have to have to dub Franny and Zooey as one of my boredom reads. At the time that I read it, I was pretty much bored out of my mind and I couldn't find anything better to read. However, after I begun reading I simply could not put it down. To be completely honest, it's not really an action packed page turner. But at the time it was a complete carbon copy of my life. I'm the type of person who is a complete drama queen(or I used to be anyway). I would blow the smallest little set back completely out of proportion, and then end up saying and doing things I regreted. All in all, I became a person that I did not want to be or know. So then it wasn't very surprising when I started cutting and was diagnosed with depression. After reading into the book a bit, I realized how [messed] up my life had become. I felt exactly the way Franny felt. Like her, I just wanted to sleep forever. But, as I continued to read and see Zooey's perspective on Franny's nervous breakdown, I began to think about everything I was doing and had done in the past. And I relized how wrong I was. I felt like I had no right to feel the way I did. And the reality of it was that I didn't at all. Toward the end I realized that my illness and my overall perspective on everything was causing me to be completely stagnant. My realization that my life was completely [messed]up prompted me to reevaluate my life and actually do something. Franny is a person that we all feel like sometimes. And Zooey is the brother that we wish we had to keep us going. No matter who you are and what your problem is, I think you will more than likely absolutly love this book. Sorry if I sound a bit psychotic, I'm really not. And sorry that I didn't include much information about the book. I hope you will read and enjoy this book. love always, nostalgia"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"For me, Holden Caulfield (Catcher in the Rye) is another whiney angsty guy, that, in the grunge-alternative-nineties, we'd all become well acquainted with. So for me, it wasn't insightful, it was obvious. Franny and Zooey is altogether fresher.Franny and Zooey, a much shorter book, much more to the point (than Catcher). It observes those little delicate moments in life that we think we're alone in, showing us why we cherish our lives so dearly.Firstly, this book, for me is like watching a favourite TV show, you can see it all very clearly, there's so much detail, it's a visual treat!Essentially about a confrontation between Franny and her brother Zooey. Both characters are filled with mystery and intrigue, but they begin to figure each other and themselves out.Funny, perceptive, thoughtful, this book makes me feel like i'm living my life, i'm a part of life. I always walk away from it enriched."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"J.D.Salinger's stories have one main common theme that I've noticed, nothing happens. In &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; Salinger crafts another masterwork where not much happens. Although he will always be known for &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;, &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; should be read by anyone who appreciates his work. &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; are two short stories that originally appeared in the New Yorker Magazine. The entire two stories build up to a single conversation that is poetic, philisophical, intelligent, insightful and moving just to start. His use of personality is incredible. A reader really connects with these characters and understands who they are. It is hard to describe really , my advise is to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is a good book, allthough like with all of Salinger's books, it leaves me wanting to know more about the carachters, I wanted to continue reading when it ended."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Like many who have read this book before me, I expected Franny and Zooey to be another Catcher in the Rye. These two books, although they explore similar themes, have entirely different approaches. Franny and Zooey is a touching story of lonely and confused siblings, one of whom is struggling with some of the most vital of life's ultimate questions. Salinger takes the time in this book to explore these universal thoughts and attempts to bring his characters and his audience at peace with them. Franny and Zooey was originally written as two seperate short stories so the characters aren't as developed as one might like. However, despite the brief descriptions, Salinger still creates sympathy for his characters and allows the reader to focus more on the morals and themes of the relgiously/philosophically based novel. This book is an important piece of literature that every curious and thoughtful person should read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I really enjoyed Salinger's novel Franny and Zooey more than Catcher in the Rye for which he is famous. This book leaves the reader a changed person. After reading this you question things like society, religion, education and your relationships with different people. I highly recommend this book and think it will open your mind to new ideas concerning things that many of us accept without questioning. I think Salinger's brillance comes across in this novel since he is able to make the reader greatly question and analzye themselves and their surroundings through his stories about the Glass family."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read this book because a friend thought it would deepen my understanding of the movie 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. She says both the movie and the book are wonderful explorations of everyone's 'private madness'. Although I can certainly see some parallels in terms of the plot, it's hard to say if I'll enjoy the movie any more. Fortunately, I enjoyed the book quite a lot on its own terms. It's divided into two compelling stories: the first one ('Franny') is quietly and darkly funny, and ends with a jolt. The second one ('Zooey') is full of witty, snide dialogue as well as some thoughtful commentary on the human condition. Actually, the remarkable achievement of this book is how Salinger manages to elicit sympathy for characters who sometimes seem far too quirky, emotionless, or arch. In fact, I think that's the main difference between the book and 'Tenenbaums'. Wes Anderson made me laugh and wince at these characters. Salinger made me care for them."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"First of all, this book is better than Catcher in the Rye.it captures the essence of spirituality: the striving towards perfection, that is, compassion, which is at the heart of Christianity, Buddhism, and most other religions. Franny loses sight of that-- that you can rail against people's egos all you want, but it doesn't make a lick of difference if you don't DO something, something spiritual about it-- if you don't love yourself and others anyway. Franny forgets that she has to act for Seymour's &quot;fat lady,&quot; who, as Zooey tells her, is really Jesus Christ himself. It's easy for Zooey to say, but as brash and cynical as he is, he is full of love, too. Otherwise he wouldn't keep reading Buddy's letter. Brilliant, a work of great love."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Maybe like most, I thought I would like this because I loved Catcher In The Rye. What a disappointment. The characters are so irritating and unlikable, and the stories did not have anything compelling about them. I was really surprised because I've heard from a few people that this was their favorite book ever. It wasn't badly written; the descriptive language was strong and captured the characters' moods and motivations. It just did not offer anything interesting, it was like being trapped in a room with a couple of bitter people with their complaints."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Book came quickly and doesn't look like it has ever been read.

Fortunately for me, I really enjoy this factor!"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"The subtext of &quot;Franny&quot; (the first half of the book) IS that Franny's pregnant. Salinger dropped subtle hints: refusing a second Martini, milk, nausea, the nervous breakdown. There has to be an inciting incident which is elusive. But Shawna Hilferty's comment (which most people found &quot;not helpful&quot;) is a well-supported one. See below."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is an interesting book in its way, and I do think it's worth reading, but after you finish reading it, please think about this, whoever reads this...If these characters are such geniuses, and so preoccupied with love, then why aren't they trying to find a cure for cancer? Wouldn't that be an act of love??? Why aren't they working with impoverished children, giving them an education? Why aren't they working to develop safe places for people to live, in case there's a nuclear war? It's because they are a couple of self-absorbed, rich, elitist jerks who don't think about how preposterously, INCREDIBLY lucky they are to have been born to parents who chose to live in a city with bookstores or libraries that even HAVE of the books they quote so freely. Also, they can get away with making boredom and ennui look theatrically sexy. Big deal. They should spend some time in the Peace Corps, or Teach for America, or distributing food at a camp in Ethiopia to starving babies. Wake up, Franny and Zooey, you absolute, total, complete, overwhelming losers. Get out in the world and help someone else, that's the only way you'll understand what love is. Two thumbs down."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Contrary to popular belief, I believe this is one story-not two-and would go as far as to say that anyone thinking this novel was two separate stories, or even two interrelated separate stories, must have missed the boat all together. The story of Franny and Zooey is about a brother and sister, whom you are persuaded (rather weakly) to believe were the victims of their older siblings' religious influences. What a bore. Salinger's philosophical spewing is elementary at best. As a side note, Salinger used the word \\"trifle\\" a trifle too many times (every four pages to be exact-- check it out)."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"That adolescents might enjoy Salinger is excusable; his work touches the same chords of narcissism, self-pity, and self-regarding idealism as those other classics of pubescent angst--Siddhartha, Atlas Shrugged, and so forth.

What???? Who cares? Franny is pregnant. The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s. But beyond that, what's the point? Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood. Boring in the 50s and boring now.As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey. Holden was familiar. Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.

I want to scream i am so annoyed. salinger could have showed the reader what he wanted to express in 2/50ths of what he did. one other problem i find to be true about his writing is that he writes about god and prayer and stuff like everyone who reads his books will be a devout christian or whatever. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD, so sue me. he thinks that everyone in the world is like that, and it is annoying. that's all i have to say about this book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book is very modern at the same time it is almost ancient. There are two stories here, connected. First, we see Franny in the first story (really a prologue) and we see her start to break down. Then in the second story we meet her brother Zooey and then we see him try to help or diagnose her in his blunt and sometimes brutal way.What emerges is almost on the scale of a classic Platonic dialogue with entire pages being quotes, with very little action taking place. The entire book is almost all conversation.So if you are not a fan of deep conversation in a book, you will probably not like this. If you are, then you probably will. The conversation centers mostly about religion but touches on fame, philosophy and literature. It's actually quite an amazing book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"J.D. Salinger is one of those writers that one either loves and thinks he is a genius, or hates him and finds him a practical joke. I, certainly, include myself in the first category. The more I read his works, the more I admire his style and geniality. \\"Franny and Zooey\\" has become one of my all time favorite books. It is short, a quick read -- but at the same time very profound and touching.Divided in two parts, each named after each sibling, the book basically tells the story of Franny nerves breakdown. In the first part we meet Franny, who meets her boyfriend for a football weekend at his college. While they are having lunch she tells him about the phoniness at school and of the egotism of the facult, what is making her sick. She also says about a religious book, in which she found the Jesus Prayer. It is supposed to be a very powerful prayer, which goes \\"Lord Jesus, have mercy on me\\". It is very simple and one must say it all the time, until it becomes as natural as breathing. This prayer is supposed to meant to cleanse one's spirit. On the way to the toilet she faints, and when she is revived, Franny begins to say the prayer.The second part, named \`Zooey', takes place some time later, and it picks up from where the first one finished. It is narrated Buddy Glass -- an older brother of Franny's and Zooey's. In the Monday right after the girl's breakdown he is at home in New York. This part consist in dialogues and an old letter from Buddy to Zooey. Every dialogue features only two characters, either Zooey and his mother, or his sister -- or only the two women.It is very powerful what the writer can bring up with his dialogues. We learn that the two of them have basically been raised on a blend of different religions, taught to them by their older brothers Buddy and Seymour (see \\"Nine Stories\\"'s \\"A Perfect Day for the Bananafish\\" to learn a little more about Seymour). Zooey try and help Franny sort out her spiritual and personal beliefs, trying to bring peace to her.Salinger is able to explore a great variety of issues using Franny's breakdown as an \`excuse'. Not only are mysticism and religion explored but also family, celebrity, education, and intellectualism. Religion, God, Jesus and personal beliefs play an important role throughout the narrative. The family plot deals with a family of geniuses that can't handle their geniality. The relationship between the siblings -- mostly Franny & Zooey, and Seymour and Buddy -- is very complex. The younger ones resent the education they received by their older brothers. Zooey usually says they became \`freaks' because of it.In \\"Franny and Zooey\\" Salinger managed to issue the experience of one's disenchantment. Franny hates both herself and others both herself and others for the egotistical behavior and phony conformity in which they all engage. One of her brothers advice is \\"If you are going to go war against the System, just do your shooting like a nice, intelligent girl -- because the enemy is there, and not because you don't like his hairdo or his goddam necktie\\".This turns out to be the central theme in this book --and that is present is most Salinger's works. Here, in \\"Franny & Zooey\\" the issue has a redemptive twist -- it feels like the writer is telling us that people with huge egos and weak wills should be respected, at least for their humanity. And this is a message that not many writers are able to prove. But Salinger can do it with beauty."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"People tend to disapear in Salinger's works, which makes the author's literary exile that much more ironic, if not compelling. Franny, the youngest of two females in the Glass family, is about to disappear, into the back of her parent's couch, during her 'spiritual crisis'. What keeps Franny from being self-involved, is that she is so concerned with humanity on a religious level, and that her ambivalence stems not from her thinking she is morally superior, but conversely, that she feels just as hypocritical and shallow as the rest of humanity, and that she cannot transcend it.What makes Salinger so enjoyable, and important, is the hand's on, non-academic philosophy in his books, and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; is most indicative of that. The novel addresses the disparities between Christianity and Buddhism, Western and Eastern thought. Franny idolizes Jesus, he has become a rock star to a little girl, with his bare-chested starving and dying. Like Holden, she shuns the phony and the arrogant. Zooey, her older brother, bitter at Seymour and Buddy (the eldest Glass bothers) for 'brainwashing' the younger two at an early age, plays devil's advocate perhaps a little too harsh, telling Franny to get over it, that she too is hypocrite, just another ego attached to their beliefs.When Franny goes overboard with tears and derision, Zooey calls Franny on the phone, pretending that he's Buddy. Buddy's tone is more gentle, more understanding. He tells Franny to love God but not religion. &quot;Do it for the Fat Lady,&quot; He says. A sublime scene involving three family members and two voices. The Fat Lady is Jesus Christ himself- not the icon, not the ideology- but the mortal man who died and did not rise again.As secular as this last note may seem, readers will let go of the last page having just underwent a 'religious experience.'"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If you were like me, you read Catcher and the Rye first. Now you are stumbling unto the other Salinger books in hopes for something possibly superior or at least not subordinate. Well, my friends, here you have it, Franny and Zooey in my opinion exceeds the expectations of the reader. Salinger adds depth and personality to these characters that are less irritating as Holden. This book is a great addition to any library, and can be especially appreciated by the reader who has a close relationship with a sibling. Buy and enjoy."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"In some ways, this novel is better than Salinger's hallmark novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, although not as solid. The book centers around two young adults who's intelligence haunts them, they see fault in everything. Some very interesting psychological truths of human nature are spilled through the words of Zooey, and the conversations between him and Franny are wonderful reading.If this were as solid as &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; structurally, it would gain that last star. Worth a read nevertheless."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I fell in love with J.D. Salinger after reading A Catcher in the Rye in school. The next year, we read Nine Stories, and I knew that he would be my favorite author forever. I went to the bookstore and bought everything else he had written (which isn't much), and I started with Franny and Zooey. What an incredible story. The reason that this book is so moving and important is that it deals with spirituality in a very serious way, yet it can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways. I related to the young protagonists because they, like myself, after being bombarded with a quite serious religious education, are able to forge out their own personal ideas of spirituality. I suggest this book to anyone, everyone can relate to it in some way. A++"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is a novel that is so simple yet so complete. Salinger sums up all the lessons of life and religion. The book itself is separated into 2 stories, &quot;Franny&quot; and then &quot;Zooey&quot;. Both stories are complex dealing with philosophy, psychology, and religion. However, the central theme of this novel is love and intelligence. This book examines the depths of human belief and happiness while at the same time the idea of resisting phoniness travels through it. Franny is a college student dealing with Life's Big Questions while Zooey helps her find the purpose of life. Salinger creates characters that any human being can relate to. We strongly recommend this book.. Once again, another wonderful book written by Salinger."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Honestly this book affects me much deeper than most stories I read. I think I am in love with Franny Glass and I despair of ever meeting a girl like her in &quot;real&quot; life. I loved every word that came out of Franny's mouth and have promised myself that anytime I feel that I am becoming too cynical, haughty, ironic, and so on, I would read this book and just admire the simplicity and generosity of Franny and Zooey. More than anything else (to me at least) this book sounds off an alarm or a talisman against the idiotic nonsense which may overwhelm an individual (such as mediatrash, career-hunting, life-decisions, academic conformity, insincerty, work, school, your boss or teacher) and the difficulty of remaining pure and not embittered by everything. The highlight of the book is simply Franny's (and Zooey's) innocent, empassioned, and original thoughts. Her words have a clean freshness and seem to have managed to maintain a sublime originality, unfettered by the conformity of thought dished at out universities or (even worse) just about anywhere else where there are people. It breaks my heart that that moron Lane does not understand what a gem he has in his girlfriend Franny, and how intently she listens to him and writes him and obvsiously values him while he does not recognize that while he blabs about his presumably pretentious and mediocre English paper (ugh!) he is sitting at lunch with a beautiful genius."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I guess I can start by saying that I had read Franny and Zooey only one time, when I was in high school decades ago (during the Nixon and Ford administrations) along with \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" from Nine Stories. I hadn't read either of them since, so I had a hazy recollection of the general outline of the stories, but my experience and enjoyment of the language was fresh and immediate.Franny is very accessible - you drop into her world of East Coast preppie kids attending Ivy League schools in the middle 1950s and you are a fly on the wall, listening to beautiful, dark-haired 20 year old Franny Glass at lunch with her pretentious and self-absorbed boyfriend Lane Coutell, as they drink martinis and smoke cigarette after cigarette. (The amount of smoking that goes on in these stories is hilarious - one assumes the entire Glass family has since succumbed to lung cancer or heart disease.)This is where we are introduced to a little book Franny carries with her everywhere called The Way of the Pilgrim. This reminds me of an aside I wished to make: the way we read now, in the Internet era. It's amazing to be able to go online at any moment while I was reading these books, to visit Wikipedia.org or Amazon.com, or be re-directed by Google to Salinger.org, and get instant gratification that, yes, The Way of the Pilgrim is a real book that you can order with One Click in a number of different translations, or be able to immediately read a quick synopsis of Plato's The Crito when Zooey mentions him in passing.Probably generations of Franny and Zooey readers were curious about The Way of the Pilgrim, and just assumed that Salinger had made it up - but I was able to quickly satisfy my curiosity, while at the same time deciding that no, I had no wish to either buy or read the Pilgrim, and instead was able to get right back to the story. So that's somewhat of a new paradigm in the way we read now, and you don't even need a Kindle - especially if you've got a good used book store near your home or office.Franny is a quick and entertaining read - you feel so sorry for her! Something is not quite right. She's not eating, she's going into the bathroom to cry, and her date is relentlessly oblivious and unhelpful. Finally she faints, and the story shifts to her 25 year old brother Zooey, who is smoking a cigarette in the bathtub and re-reading a four year old missive from their older brother Buddy, which luckily Salinger shares with us. We soon meet their mom, Bessie, and enjoy many pages of humorous dialog with her. Zooey finally gets dressed and goes into the Glass family living room in their Manhattan apartment to wake his sister.The remainder of Zooey is all about his attempts to heal her through the power of his words, in turn hectoring, reminding, irritating, edifying and amusing her, until at the end of the story (I won't spoil it,) I gasped with emotion, an intake of breath that literally caught in my throat with a click as he delivered the big payoff line on the last page. It was an authentic moment of truth and a great ending to a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book is great. Salinger's writing is beautiful. His characters are interesting, intricate, human, and often intense. He doesn't need crazy action sequences or ballyhoo. His characters merely converse with each other, and yet his book is more engaging than almost any action novel, and it is certainly more thought provoking.This book has changed me. It didn't change my life in any dramatic or wild way, but, having read it, I am now subtly different. For one, I realized that I had slipped into some of the dubious thinking that Zooey describes in the book. Second, I now view literature in a slightly different light. This book certainly stands out in the crowd. Finally, I feel inspired by this book's high quality - I feel slightly elevated. This probably doesn't make sense to you, who are reading this review. Maybe it will after you read the book.I wholeheartedly recommend this book, although I still think \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is better.Finally, if you have read The Bible and a little of Epictetus' work, then you'll appreciate certain passages of \\"Franny and Zooey\\" a bit more."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I had the opportunity to read \\"Franny and Zooey\\" for a book group following upon the death of J.D. Salinger (1919 -2010). I had read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and this book as well, as I remember, late in high school but had not revisited the author since then.I was struck by the religious, spiritual themes of the book, especially its involvement with Eastern religion and with mysticism. My interest in Buddhism has increased in recent years as I have become older. Salinger's books, which appealed to young people many years ago, seem to have aged with the time.The book includes two short interrelated stories written a few years apart, \\"Franny\\" (1955) and \\"Zooey\\" (1957), which were published in book form in 1961. The two are the youngest children of the Glass family that Salinger created. Franny is 20 and her brother Zooey 25. There were seven Glass children, all of whom were intellectual and child prodigies who appeared, over the course of nearly 20 years, on a radio quiz show called \\"Its a Wise Child.\\" Their intellectual brilliance, among many other factors, have left them confused about themselves. The oldest Glass child, Seymour, had committed suicide seven years before the events described in \\"Franny and Zooey\\". In these two stories, Franny and Zooey are shown with their difficulties and with their attempts to come to a sense of peace, understanding, and detachment in terms which are overtly spiritual.The story \\"Franny\\" takes place over a college football weekend in 1955 where Franny comes to visit her boyfriend, Lane Coutrell. The story takes place over lunch between Franny and Lane and consists of their conversation. Franny is critical of her boyfriend and of his conventionality. She criticizes her professors amd most of the people around her for what she sees as complacency, ignorance, and egoism. In seeming contrast to what she perceives, Franny carries with her a Russian religious book called \\"The Way of a Pilgrim\\"The Way of a Pilgrimwhich discusses the need for continuous prayer as a well to self-illuminations. She discusses \\"The Way of a Pilgrim\\" and other forms of religious mantras found in Eastern religion with a skeptical and uninterested Lane during the course of their lunch. She collapses.The longer story \\"Zooey\\" takes place a few days following Franny's weekend with Lane. It is set in the Glass family home in New York City. The first character we meet is Zooey who is rereading a long letter from his brother, Buddy, which recounts the Glass family story and urges Zooey to be active and to make something of his life. The remainder of the story consists of conversations between Zooey and his mother, Bessie, and between Zooey and Franny. Zooey struggles to overcome his feelings as a \\"freak\\" and as an ousider and to suppress his disdain for a culture devoted to television. Zooey is concerned for his sister and for her devotion to what he perceives as a religious cult which will separate her from the need to go forward and live. Franny and Zooey have two intense conversations, the first face-to-face, and the second over the telephone where Zooey initially disguises himself as the brother, Buddy. Both Franny and Zooey seem to find ways of moving forward following their conversations.The book as a whole reminded me most of the Bhagavadgita in its theme of activity and doing what one needs to do more than of any Buddhist teaching. The book also reminded me of Kerouac who was active at about the same time as Salinger. Reading it as someone who is far from young, I had a sense of the quandries in which Franny and Zooey found themselves. I have struggled with some of the same religious texts and issues over the years. For all its success, this is a book that should be read quietly and in solitude.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is my favorite book by Salinger. Though \\"Catcher\\" is a great book as well, \\"Franny and Zooey\\" brings out the sometimes awkward, but profound, relationship that can exist between a brother and sister. The best parts of the book are the conversations between Zooey and Mrs. Glass in the bathroom and between Franny and Zooey. Though Franny seems to be the one going through a personal journey by means of the \\"Jesus prayer,\\" I find Zooey's transformation of dealing with Seymour's death and his relationship with his sister and mother to be the most profound. Zooey, I feel, is the one to really verbalize and discover the meaning of the \\"Jesus prayer\\" for himself."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"There is no escaping from J.D. Salinger while growing up. It is one of those obligatory reads that every youth must endeavor--\\"Catcher in the Rye\\". I remember dear friends spouting sonnets over how wonderful they found this novel to be. I read it many times, and always found it to be very well written and overall a great story--but I never felt the spark like friends and acquaintances. I caught the Salinger bug after I finished \\"Franny & Zooey\\".This novel brings \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" full circle. Like Caulfield, the Glasses are extremely gifted and quite fed up with the shortcomings of people--and life in general. The first half of the novel is Franny's story. It is an account of the conversation between herself and her boyfriend--it is riddled with spirituality, religion and philosophy. The latter half is Zooey trying to shed some light onto the ways of the world after Franny's nervous breakdown.Salinger is a master with dialogue. The novel deals with high-brow matters such as: how to cope in a crazy world surrounded by people who are neither bright nor righteous? Or more simply--how to live.I believe that along with \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", this should be on the mandatory reading list."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is not really a single novel. Rather, it's more like two novellas, though the novellas have overlapping characters. These stories, originally published in The New Yorker magazine, concern Franny and Zooey Glass, two members of the family that was the subject of most of Salinger's short fiction (and also the Wes Anderson movie The Royal Tannenbaums). Franny is an intellectually precocious late adolescent who tries to attain spiritual purification by obsessively reiterating the \\"Jesus prayer\\" as an antidote to the perceived superficiality and corruptness of life. She subsequently suffers a nervous breakdown. In the second story, her next older brother, Zooey, attempts to heal Franny by pointing out that her constant repetition of the \\"Jesus prayer\\" is as self-involved and egotistical as the egotism against which she rails. Entertaining and intelligent."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Don't buy the massmarket paperback .. very bad quality print and awful size/design.

Each viewpoint expressed has its own merits and its own drawbacks, but each side is treated with a certain amount of respect. In far too many other books, the author's own philosophies will get in the way of the story and skew it in such a manner that one argument gets though virtually unscathed, while the other one ends up looking remarkably shaky. The person with the &quot;correct&quot; ideas is shown to be thoughtful and wise while the other ends up looking like a close-minded jerk. Here, however, J. D. Salinger was able to show both sides, warts and all, while letting both Franny and Zooey's viewpoint remain intact and stay true to their character. The discussion they have is quite realistic and touches on real subjects - taking the higher and nobler aspects of religious and theology and bringing them into one's everyday life is something that a lot of people have thought about but not everyone has done.I highly recommend these two stories. They're real and they're believable."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"While not a novel, but actually two seperate stories about two Glass family members(The Glass Family is the ficticous family that also appears in other Salinger stories), Franny the youngest and her older brother Zooey, who appears in the second story of the same name. Obviously, nothing J.D. Salinger has written or less likely will ever write will ever top his masterpiece, 'The Catcher in the Rye', but these two short stories are a complex psychological/religious look at the complex and confused life of Franny Glass. Take note the first story, 'Franny' is alot easier a read than the second story, 'Zooey'-which is much more detailed and slightly more complex. Both are entertaining. Also, read 'Seymour: An Introduction', which is about the elder Glass Family sibling."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book is JD Salinger's finest. The characters are wonderfully crafted. Zooey and Bessie are laugh out loud funny. In this book Salinger encapsulates familial love to an unsurpassed degree. I cannot reccommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This was the first book in a long, long time to blow my hair back. Maybe it got to me personally because of the metaphysical &quot;fringe,&quot; but I love Salinger's writing in general, and the Glass family he introduces here includes a great set of characters just as piquant as Holden Caulfield, if not more so. I probably would've given four stars if it weren't for the ending and the Fat Lady; the philosophy she expresses is old, but I've never seen it communicated anywhere near the way Salinger does."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is a deep book about a disfunctional family. Franny is a young college student who becomes obsessed with reading and reciting prayers from her &quot;Jesus Prayer Book&quot;. She has just had a nervous break down after a short visit with her boyfriend, Lane, away at school. During the second story, she is struggling with her relationship with her mother, her brother Zooey, and her obsession with her prayer book. Also in the second story, her brother Zooey tries to help Franny by trying to make her realize that her obsession with this prayer book is unhealthy. He says that it is superficial. Throughout the book, the family members struggle to cope with one another."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read this book and really enjoyed it, but am also curious if there is some message that I am missing. I was a little upset at the end and wished that there had been more, but after stepping away from the book, I can accept the ending."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I think that although it is variable mis-understood it is truely a snapshot into another frame. If you don't like this book thats ok, but keep that to yourself!! You have to read a copy of Salinger to understand what the dialoge is. Not incoherent but a cosmic infident to be relished not ridiculed."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I feel that this book is fantastic and should in no way be compared to &quot;Catcher&quot; because the content is much different. For those of you who said it was too full of &quot;pointless&quot; dialouge fail to look into what the book is trying to say (as do those people who criticize &quot;Catcher&quot;). If you fail to look beyond the surface then the message will be lost on you. For those of you who have the ability to take a book for more than surface value you will really enjoy this book. Those of you who can't will not enjoy this book and I doubt could enjoy any book of any real value. In my opinion it's sad to see people giving this book a bad review just because they lack insight. It's even worse when they decide to not even give a name or e-mail address when they post an unfounded comment like that. I hope future readers of this wonderful book will be more open minded."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If not for my 12 year old sister in law I may have never read this book. And that would have been to my great loss. I &quot;made&quot; my sister in law read The Catcher in the Rye to give her a little more of an idea what real literature was about. She loved it. Needless to say she wanted to read more Salinger and as I wasn't familiar with the content I read it first. Had I not it would not be as of now my favorite book. The contents af this book are so self exploring to the person who can relate to it. It makes you say hey &quot;I'm like that too, but why?&quot; It is the kind of book that makes you think. And what else are books for? In conclusion all I can say is Mr. Salinger where have you gone? We'd all love to hear from you again, if not for us do it for the Fat Lady."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"As with much of Salinger's short pieces, there is much more depth to his writing than there appears on the surface. For me, 'Franny' is one of his most perfect stories. There is much also to be taken from 'Zooey', but I also think it detracts from the simple beauty and openness to interpretation of the first story. Reading 'Franny' on its own - which is how it was originally published after all - my first impression was that Franny was pregnant. The clues are at the start of the story, as some reviewers have commented - &quot;... so you can relax about that Friday night. I don't even think they heard us come in&quot;, says Franny. At the very end of the story, Lane also says: &quot;When was that Friday night? Way the hell early last month, wasn't it?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;That's no good. Too goddam long between drinks. To put it crassly.&quot; The fact that these quotes frame the whole story, and the timing of the event, could lead you to conclude that Franny is pregnant. Admittedly, however, this is not followed-up in 'Zooey', but it does still remain a possibility, I think."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book is indeed no petty look at at pregnant adolescent's pesky family -- it is a marvelous spiritual guide to life. Read also &quot;Seymour -- An Introduction&quot;; &quot;Raise High The Roof Beam Carpenters&quot; and much of &quot;Nine Stories&quot; to realize the true depths of the Glass family's spiritual search."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Some (including the author himself) say that Buddy Glass is a reflection of Salingers innermost thoughts. I say Franny Glass is as close as we'll ever come. Through this novel we see Salinger's mind come alive with thoughts of reclusion, God, and a meaning to life. Picturing the twinkle in Bessie's eyes as her &quot;only truly handsome son&quot; teases her, we see Salinger's light of heart, and through Franny's final thoughtful, knowing stare as she grasps the infinite knowledge of meaning we view his contemplation. Could we ever really know JD Salinger-- the man, the myth, the recluse? Probably not, but we also aren't coming any closer than this. Read it, and never look back."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Salinger takes the timeless topic of humanities attempt to find a purpose in life and carries it to a new level through the dialouge of two unforgettable characters, Franny and Zooey. Funny, intelligent and philosophical. I wish he would have continued for another two hundred pages."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny was feeling, or emotion if you will, and Zooey was thought or logic. Salinger had them as brother and sister, destined to fight, squabble, and conflict--but none the less more complete togethor."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Okay, let's talk about the whole Franny being pregnant issue and why it is completely wrong. Seymour, the guy that died, was having the same problems as Franny and I'm pretty sure he wasn't pregnant. In his other book, Holden was pretty near a breakdown too, and for some unexplained reason, I don't think he was pregnant either. The whole too long a time between sips or drinks or whatever doesn't prove anything because she is far away from him. All it shows is that she really doesn't like him which is pretty obvious anyway. She doesn't need to be having a baby not to want to be with him.I don't think the book loses meaning either. I think it loses its real meaning when you think she's pregnant. Putting the issue aside for a minute, I think it really is a good book, and I think that if you like salinger it's very good."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Catcher in the Rye gets more attention, but Franny and Zooey blew me away, too. I read the whole thing in about two sittings - I hadn't planned to, but it was just so wonderful that I couldn't put the book down. If you don't like books where characters sit around talking for hundreds of pages, well, you won't like this book - because all the characters really do is sit around and talk. But it's wonderful talk, the kind that really makes you think. So go out and read it, now."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Oh, where do I begin...?Ninth grade, that's the time. I was in a Salinger frenzy. I had just read The Catcher in the Rye for the, oh...I don't know, 11th time (in two months!), and it was suddenly becoming boring to me. This, I believed, was a crisis. Surely this Salinger man had written more angsty books for me to devour...and devour multiple times afterward. I sent my mom to the library with the command that she check out whatever Salinger books were available, and she came back with a pristine mint-colored book titled Franny and Zooey and a sordid, smelly, yellow-paged 1950's copy of Raise High the Roofbeam, Carpenters and Seymour, an Introduction.Naturally I chose to read the former first.I remember the day more clearly than yesterday: It was frigid and February and Monday. The worst combination possible. I was straightening my hair for school the next day (sadly, it takes me an hour), and I was reading Franny and Zooey at the same time. Now, as much as I hate to admit this, I'd better say it- I hardly knew any of the vocabulary in the book. What the heck did sublime mean? Pious? I was number five in my class (let me be vain for a moment and say that I am now number one!), yet I couldn't tell you the definition of formidable. Formidable were my vocabulary skills...Anyways! Back to the story. I was struggling through Salinger's wordiness, trying desperately to hang on and find the Holden-ness that I was looking for, when finally! I found it. Franny said phony. PHONY. It was like seeing an old friend for the first time in years. Just as I could relate to Holden, I could relate to Franny and her hatred for, well, everybody. I was, for a reason that I still can't quite put my finger on, deeply moved by her sudden sickness in the restaurant. So moved that, after I finished straightening my hair, I began to develop a headache. And that night I couldn't even eat my stroganauff. Is that how you spell it? Spell check is trying to tell me that I mean astronaut. Anyways, I went to bed early that night, Franny and Zooey sitting on the floor beside my bed...The next I woke up, still in Franny mode. In my melodramatic fourteen year old ways, I told all my friends that I was dying as a I stumbled drunkenly around the lunch room. I really did feel bad, though. I called my mom during P.E. to sign me out. Not because I didn't want to run laps either. I actually liked that class...but that's beside the point. She said I was probably just getting a cold. Thinking back, I never did get a cold that week. I went home and started reading the Zooey portion of the book. And I don't think I ever stopped reading that afternoon. I skipped band practice with the meager excuse \\"but I've got a headache!\\" and continued to read. The only time I stopped was to watch American Idol, but you better believe I picked up that book on the commercial breaks. Finally, right around 9:39, if I remember correctly (I have a remarkable eye for pointless details), I finished the book. I was floored. Astounded. Blown away. In awe. Changed forever. I'm not sure if I really, well, consciously understood the book, but something about it moved me in a way that no other book ever has. Not even Holden's story, which I tell everyone I will name my son after when I get older. I mean, Holden is a cute name, when you think about it.Fast-forward. No, not to my own Holden's birth. I'm not that old. This is only about one and half years later. I'm 16, folks.During June, I bought a couple of books on Amazon. I miraculously stumbled upon a small fortune (by small fortune I mean fifteen dollars) and couldn't bear to keep it for any longer than a day. So, it was books. I needed some books. Funny thing was, there weren't any in particular that I wanted. Coincidentally, Franny and Zooey popped up on my recommended books, so I figured what the heck. I started reading it the day that my family moved to a new town. I read through my grandma's crying, movers dropping boxes, little sisters screaming (Well, that's a regular thing), and construction workers hammering. Once again, I could not set that book down.But a lot can change in a year and a half. I actually understood the book. I found myself smiling at nearly every sentence, loving how very clever and scrupulously crafted each one was. I thought the whole thing was a work of genius- Lane's apathetic frog leg smacking, Zooey's merciless bullying of his mother, Franny and her cat....the whole thing is just funny and moving and don't even get me started on the ending. I absolutely adore the ending....BUT OH!!! I didn't even tell y'all the weirdest part. (Excuse the y'all; I have a horrible southern accent!) There are some eerie resemblances between my family and the Glass family. For one, we both have 7 kids, two of which are twins. Most people think we're all attractive and smart (though I may be a little biased there) so that's another one. And weirdest of all, our old street had the same name as the street the Glass family lives on. And EVER WEIRDER (how can that be possible?), J. D. Salinger once briefly lived in my tiny Georgia hometown. And, of course, he didn't like it too much.So...that is my epic adventure regarding Franny and Zooey. I hope I didn't wast too much of your time. ;]"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is yet another controversial writing of J.D. Salinger that I personally love. The book is divided into two sections \\"Franny\\" and \\"Zooey\\". The first section, Franny, gives the background and basis for what is going on in the novel. It gives the reader insight into Franny's ideas and the problems she is dealing with. The second part of the book, Zooey, give the reader more background information on both Franny and Zooey's lives and offers some explanation as to where Franny's problems originated. The meat of the story is in this section as well. This is where Zooey and Franny actually interact with each other and Zooey helps Franny to find the internal, spiritual peace she is searching for. There are many important themes in the book as well. Love is a major theme in this novel. There is a certain deep rooted love between all of the children in the story. Salinger, through Zooey's insight, shows the reader the importance of having love and/or respect for everyone, even if you do not like them. Finding yourself is also a major theme in the novel. Franny finds herself lost in college. She is struggling to determine what she believes in and wants to find some sort of spiritual awakening, which her brother helps her to do.I really enjoyed reading this novel and I believe others will too. Whether it is not having privacy (like Zooey in the bathroom with his mother Bessie), or being in a relationshipthat is just not fulfilling (Franny and her boyfriend Lane), or searching for your own spirituality (Franny), everyone can find someone or something in the novel to relate to. It raises many of societies controversial questions and gives the reader a certain sense of enlightenment."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This was a really good book because it makes you go into depth and think about everything that goes on. At times it frustrates you and at others it makes you question the actions the characters do. I think that all in all it was a very interesting book because the author makes the reader familiarize to the family's behaviors and faults. It's a story of a brother and a sister who are trying to find their true selves as they exist and try to live under the morale and standards of a disfunctional family. The way they lie and the way they talk to each other makes you think and realize the kind of lives they're living. Franny, the youngest of the Glass family has just had a breakdown in the process of discovering what the important things are to her. She seems to be falling very deep into this and all she really needs is someone to talk to. Luckily, she has the love of someone to help her out, her brother Zooey who fortunately has the courage to help her find who the 'fat lady' truly is."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey was an excellent book. The character's cynicism and reality caught my attention right away. I enjoyed Zooey most of all. I believe this is one of Salinger's best novels. The writing was simple yet thought provoking. The problems of the family were interesting and made you think of a typical dysfunctional family. I loved the reality of the book. It hit you and then forced you to listen. The theories of Zooey were profound and very interesting. I believe that Salinger is a very talented writer, one of my favorites, and he shows it in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who can enjoy a harsh sense of reality and cynicism, mostly those in college."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read this book the winter of my freshman year at college. Never have I read a book that spoke so personally to me. Disillusionment, alienation, frustration with &quot;pseudo-intellectuals&quot;...the book tackled so many issues I was dealing with in my life, and it did so honestly and without fluff. I especially recommend Franny and Zooey to any theatre major who is struggling to retain his or her sense of identity and honesty in an area filled with fake people. Salinger's characters are the most honest, raw, REAL characters I have ever read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Like many, I'm sure, I loved Catcher in the Rye and wanted to read another book by J.D. Salinger. I happened to be in the mood for a quick read, so I figured I'd check this out. Bad decision. Although the book isn't entirely boring and uneventful, it mostly is. The book is a whole lot of talking and not a whole lot of substance. The dialogue is very well done, but it gets annoying when it just goes on and on. It gets very, very repetitive as well. Every now and again Salinger breaks it up with some useless, repetitive descriptions.The book actually starts out okay. It's not an exceptional opening, but it's adequate. You think that Salinger will go into more detail and character development, but he doesn't. There are two characters in this book, Franny...and Zooey. The rest of the characters, like 2 or 3, are very, very minor characters. The story just isn't interesting and it's not what I expected. Believe me when I say that I enjoy a wide range of books and that I am easy-going and easily interested in lot's of topics. Someone who has trouble getting interested in reading in the first place would NEVER get past the first couple pages of the Zooey section of the book, unless forced to.Anyway, I hope this review has helped you to make a decision if you are looking up reviews to decide to read this or not. I understand this may be a cult classic and that others in the past may have enjoyed this, but there is no way I can give this a good review and say that it was enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is an amazing novel by the great J.D. Salinger. Salinger makes the cynist Glass family come alive in the novel, and is laugh out loud funny throughout. What is truly remarkable about this novel is that it consists of three long conversations - which is a feat that many authors could not pull off.This novel is a 5/5, and anyone who has ever met a 'section man' will right away relate to Salinger's masterpiece."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"When they hear the name J.D. Salinger, most people immediately think of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; which is far and away his most-popular book. If you bother to read the rest of Salinger's output, you find that most of it deals with the Glass family to one degree or another. From &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; in &quot;Nine Stories,&quot; to &quot;Raise High The Roofbeam, Carpenter, and Seymour: an Introduction,&quot; the Glass family was the focus of Salinger's efforts.Salinger's best can be found in &quot;Franny and Zooey.&quot;Sure, Franny is a histrionic drama-queen, and Zooey is a megalomaniacal, friendless jerk, who treats everyone around him as second-rate, but by the book's end, you understand how their childhoods (or lack thereof) have molded them this way.Franny has a sort of nervous breakdown, and she decides that reciting &quot;The Jesus Prayer,&quot; as prescribed in a little book called &quot;Journey of the Pilgrim,&quot; will eventually grant her peace. Her know-it-all brother, Zooey, lays into her, telling her that if she's going to pray &quot;The Jesus Prayer,&quot; she needs to understand who Jesus was, and not picture Him as St. Francis of Assisi, somebody's grandmother, and their dead eldest brother, Seymour, rolled up into one. There are lots of philosophies and religious doctrines batted around, but it all boils down to a difficult brother caring for his difficult sister.I've read this book ten times, at least, and the most satisfying have been when I read all the Zooey lines aloud. (Yes, this must confuse the hell out of my neighbors, but the dialogue is so strong and rich, that it cries out to be heard and spoken, not just read silently.)Try &quot;Franny and Zooey.&quot; If you can forgive the two title characters, you'll find a rich and rewarding read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Salinger has left us to decide whether Franny is pregnant with child or just spiritual birth but the clues are there. First in her letter to Lane she mentions in the postscript that her mother isn't mad and therefore not aware that he'd snuck into the Glass apartment one Friday night weeks before. Secondly he plans to sneak up to her room that night. What better parallel development than a child growing within her during her spiritual awakening ?? Is there no possibility that the physical symptoms are hormonal changes brought on by pregnancy ?? Is Salinger's writing so one-dimensional he'd only provide the &quot;hit me over the head&quot; spirituality theme in the novel ?? I personally believe the &quot;Franny&quot; section was a masterwork while the &quot;Zooey&quot; section was down a level. Taken as a whole it's a beautifully crafted story with engaging characters leaving no doubt of Salingers gift for the writing craft."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"At the end of Franny, Lane assures her that he will later try to sneak up the back staircase to the room that he has reserved for her. Thus indicating that THEY ARE LOVERS. Whether or not she is pregnant still remains in question, but there is slight indications that she just may be! However on the other hand, her physical illness may she be a result of psychosomaticism, not a result of pregnancy. It's up to the reader to decipher, but at the same time TO ALL OF YOU WHO RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY of Franny being pregnant, you are WRONG.Franny and Zooey was an interesting novel, an in depth anaylisis of the deepest part of mankind - -an exploration into the soul of humanity. However, hafta say as a sixteen year old, I enjoyed Catcher more!I could relate to its issues on a first-hand basis, whereasFranny and Zooey was a bit too philisophical and explored topics which I have not even begun to consider!

This notion has been making the rounds since the story was first published in The New Yorker, in 1955. The first section of the book gives us a fairly objective view of Franny Glass and her life. The second section, thornier and more complex, puts her in the context of a complicated and demanding family, and we can fairly see her crisis in the making.

This is the only other Salinger work that I have attempted and I'm honestly a bit torn as to how to rate it. I'm going to give it 2 out of 5 stars, with this caveat--were it not for Salinger's exceptional use of dialogue, this book would be worthless. The main characters, Franny and Zooey Glass, are extremely shallow and spend the entire book acting like obnoxious spoiled children. The entire [albeit, thankfully short] novel consists of repetitive conversations, with Salinger every once in a while throwing in an overly descriptive paragraph. Do we really NEED to know the entire contents of the Glass family medical cabinet? I think not.

It is the book of Weltschmertzen, of world-weariness, and it gives an example of how easy it is for humans to tire of all that they know, but it also examines how we can perhaps make peace with the listlessness inside."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Reading \\"Franny and Zooey\\" is like watching a not-so-good Woody Allen film: mannered, smart-alecky, brittle, neurotic, New Yorkery, overly talky, quirky, boring, infuriating, annoying, show-offy, and just simply tiresome.The book consists of two stories. \\"Franny is 41 pages long, and \\"Zooey\\" is 155 pages long. In her story Franny is exasperating and egotistic as she argues with her college date in a New Haven restaurant at lunch before a college football game. She drinks too much and has obviously come close to a mental break-down by overdoing her repetition of the Jesus prayer.\\"Zooey\\" starts with a long argument/discussion between Zooey and his mother Bessie in the bathroom of the Glass Manhattan apartment while Zooey is in the tub, and the mother is apparently seated on the toilet. Everyone smokes an awful lot in both stories.The second part of the story is a long argument/diatribe between Zooey and Franny in the Glass living room in which Zooey talks about the Jesus prayer and says it's very convenient that Franny has come home after the New Haven confrontation to have her nervous break-down in the comfort of her own home. Zooey is clever enough, after a terrible amount of palaver, to give Franny some comfort and peace of mind though.Bessie and Les Glass, an old vaudeville team, had seven children: Seymour, Buddy, Boo Boo, Fanny, Zooey, and the twins Walt and Waker. Walt had been killed in an accident in Japan. Seymour committed suicide in Salinger's short story \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\\" From 1927 to 1943 the Glass children at various times appeared on the radio program \\"It's a Wise Child,\\" a program similar to radio's real \\"Quiz Kids\\" which featured precocious children. Zooey said the parents made the kids into freaks. Zooey (Zacharay) is an actor, and Franny is a college senior.All the arguments and endless discussions of religion are boring in a work of fiction. Zooey's long rant in the living room about Franny saying of the Jesus prayer tries the reader's patience. Zooey makes a phone call and imitates brother Buddy. She recognizes Zooey. He says she needs detachment and desirelessness. He boosts her ego by assuring her she's a good actress. Seymour had told Zooey, that even though he was on the radio, he should shine his shoes for the fat lady, an anonymous listener.My advice is to stay with the story; you may like it or hate it, but it is what it is."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I have read Catcher in the Rye many times during the course of many years.

At the moment, I fail to see the genius I saw in \\"Catcher.\\""},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey (1961) is J. D. Salinger's two-part novel about an intellectual and spiritually unfulfilled girl and her intellectual, snobbish brother. This novel features the Glass family, which Salinger has written about on other occasions. The majority of the book consists of three lengthy conversations: between Franny and her boyfriend, between Zooey and their mother, and between Franny and Zooey. The novel is so dialogue-heavy it reads very much like a play. The book's primary theme is spirituality, particularly of an Eastern bent (which is what Salinger himself was so fascinated by).What Salinger does very well is communicate his characters' feelings subtly, through their speech and behavior, rather than by narration, which takes all the style out of things. The reader really feels like he or she gets to know Franny and Zooey (neither of them is particularly likeable, but that's beside the point).While the dialogue between Salinger's characters is generally quite good, they all have the unbearable tendency to launch into unrealistic and lengthy monologues at any given moment. Here, at times, Salinger is in effect preaching to the reader.Inexplicably, Salinger is eternally focused on smoking. The reader always knows what each character is smoking, whether it's lit, and what hand he or she is holding it in. It's to the point of distraction, and serves no reasonable purpose other than to briefly interrupt interminable monologues. Salinger also displays other tendencies to micromanage his characters and their world (he gives ridiculously long descriptions of certain things, most egregiously the contents of the medicine cabinet).Ultimately, Franny and Zooey's downfall is that it doesn't particularly go anywhere. There's no real payoff. Two hundred pages of pampered, superior huffing and puffing, while entertaining at times and tedious by the end, climaxes with an unsatisfactory piece of basic, Eastern-worldview advice that gets treated as the greatest of revelations."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Salinger has much more to offer beyond Holden Caufield. The overshadowed, under-appreciated Franny and Zooey introduces its readers to the intriguing Glass family, who reappears in Salinger's later works Raise High the Roofbeam Carpenters and the first of Nine Stories. Separated into two intertwining stories, the book first enraptures its reader with the dramatically sensitive Franny. The young woman is looking for answers to life questions by reexamining her society and spirituality. The reader paddles through Salinger's stream of conscious, following Franny in her search for sincerity in a petty world. As in grand Salinger fashion, the reader is left hanging at the end of the first story, helpless to succumb jumping into the second part, Zoey. The focus here is on Franny's brother, while ingeneously weaving back to the first story to tie up loose ends. Both parts of the book are strong enough to stand alone, but together they constitute Salinger's finest work to date."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If after reading the Catcher in the Rye, thou art in quest for a solution to Holden's insufferable discontent, or would like to read some Salinger without necessarily being ridiculously biased to the point that it affects your appreciation of the story itself, get Franny and Zooey, which I think is a better book than Catcher, and also holds Salinger's existential answers.F&Z; is divided in 2 parts: the first part, considerably shorter, is FRANNY. We are told the story of Franny Glass (had you read Nine Stories you would've met her oldest brother, Seymour). Or rather, we are told the story of Franny Glass's nervous breakdown reaching its boiling point. She has come to visit her boyfriend Lane Coutell at University. She is not at all well: irritable, nervous, impatient, and moody, as opposed to her usual docile nature. We soon find out that she is obsessed with a book named The Way of the Pilgrim, in which a Russian peasant-turned-spiritual voyager, explains the method of achieving closeness to God by incessantly repeating the Jesus Prayer.As usual with Salinger's favorites, Franny feels absolutely out of place and utterly misunderstood by Lane. Her disorientation as to what to do, her inconformity with school and society at its peak, and her anxiousness for achieving that state of perfection described in The Way of the Pilgrim, make her collapse.Then comes ZOOEY, the longer tale. We are introduced to the fully fascinating Glass family... These were all remarkably intelligent children. Zooey and Franny were both partly raised by their two older brothers and thus, by their fascination with Eastern philosophy. Indeed, the book oozes with spirituality and long dissertations on religion and human nature- and surprisingly enough, it doesn't sound pretentious or distant, but oddly familiar. Perhaps because of Salinger's knowledge and regard for these theories.In order not to narrate with too much detail, it is enough to say that it merely concerns Zooey's attempts at helping Franny to make sense. His rants about individuality and tolerance are rather self-indulgent, but do not cease to be fascinating. What is most important is that he answers all the questions left suspended by the abrupt ending of the Catcher in the Rye: what can Franny and Holden do with their constant disdain of others, their judgment of the \\"phonies\\", their sensitivity, and their lack of figures to look up to or seek support from? Obviously I will not translate his conclusions, but it is unquestionably worth reading... perhaps even more than the Catcher in the Rye. It is not as humorous, but certainly twice as endearing, and much more authentic."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"\\"An artist's only concern is to shoot for some kind of perfection, and on his own terms, not anyone else's,\\" declares Zooey Glass to his sister Franny, and Salinger italicizes the words \\"on his own terms\\" in case there was any doubt. Not that you doubt Salinger's artistic integrity. His sanity, however, is another story.Madness is at the center of J.D. Salinger's \\"Franny And Zooey,\\" published together in 1961 after first seeing print as separate stories in \\"The New Yorker\\" (\\"Franny\\" in 1955, \\"Zooey\\" two years later.) While the two stories work in tandem as they deal with the same concerns and main characters and are set a day or two apart, they feel quite distant from one another. Salinger abandons the discipline and wonderful ambiguity of \\"Franny\\" for a rambling philosophical tract that seems to be written more for Salinger and his fictional brainchildren than any outside reader.In \\"Franny,\\" the title character is a college student who has had it with pedantic professors and her stuck-up boyfriend. She longs for spiritual contentment, one detached from materialistic ego. Failing, she sinks into a state of near catatonia as she recites a prayer over and over trying to make a decisive break.It is one of the finest stories Salinger wrote, which means a lot considering he wrote \\"For Esme With Love And Squalor\\" and \\"The Laughing Man.\\" In the opening paragraph alone, we get a wonderful sense of place watching Yale boys await their dates' arrival via train, Salinger displaying both that pungent wit and considerable humanistic charm which made \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" so special.As they huddle in groups in their overcoats against the autumn chill, \\"each young man, in his strident, conversational turn, was clearing up, once and for all, some highly controversial issue, one that the outside, non-matriculating world had been bungling, provocatively or not, for centuries.\\"By focusing on one of these men, Lane Coutell, and letting us meet his date Franny Glass through his eyes, Salinger immediately sets the right tone, describing her spiritual crisis in a series of awkward pauses over martinis and uneaten food. Lane is a decent young man, but absolutely not what she needs at that moment, made clearer as she begins to fall apart before him. She worries about her soul; he worries about her lousing up his homecoming weekend.It's a fun, subtly presented dichotomy. As she talks about her admiration for a pilgrim she has read of who has dedicated his life to prayer, one is reminded of how well Salinger used spirituality to inform his sublime short story \\"Teddy.\\"\\"Franny\\" ends poignantly, if abruptly, but instead of leaving well enough alone, he wrote the sequel story \\"Zooey,\\" more than three times the length of \\"Franny\\" and more an endurance run than sprint. Now back home, Franny lies on a sofa in her parents' apartment as her brother Zooey tries to rouse her from her mental state by telling her what life is really all about.Calling \\"Zooey\\" a mess is to be kind. It is pompous, fuzzy-minded, and as divorced from reality as \\"Franny\\" was grounded in it. Salinger itemizes the contents of every overstuffed room in the Glass house, even the medicine cabinet. Long, rambling conversations are written out in stenographic detail, while paragraphs detail Zooey's shaving methods and his attitudes toward various brilliant siblings, alive and dead.I don't want to say \\"Zooey\\" is terrible, because it isn't. Salinger offers some interesting concepts. Though the Glass family is pretty insufferable in their intellectual and spiritual superiority (and becomes more so, in later Salinger works), their complicated interrelationships are detailed in amusing fashion. Every now and again Salinger hits a great note.You may like \\"Zooey\\" for what it is; if so you can be happy knowing you have that much in common with the author. The rest of us will have to make do with \\"Franny,\\" a fair bit of solace indeed."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"So. I'm a little frustrated.I am a kid (I'm sixteen; there's no way I'm going to call myself a woman) who's pretty serious about religion. My problem? Every kid I meet who supposedly is serious about religion A. is Protestant (I'm Catholic); B. uses the word &quot;just&quot; (as in &quot;I just want to thank you for just being so great&quot; etc.) at least 50 times in any public prayer; C. wants to make God fun; or D. all of the above.I was beginning to think that no one thought the way I did. but then -- bada bing! -- I picked up &quot;Franny and Zooey.&quot; I had read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and liked it, so when I needed a read, I picked up the next Salinger that caught my eye. What did I find? An honest talk about God, as well as some kids who aren't facsimiles of every other John or Jane Doe from Anytown, USA. These kids are intelligent. They do not instantly swallow whatever is given to them. They question, they ruminate, they THINK until they know what they believe. And they are still messed up, but they know it and accept it. They are what I aspire to. Not to accept nothing, but to realize what I accept when I make choices about who I am, which, unless I am mistaken, means what I think is true.&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; gives me something to think about, and for that, I applaud Mr. Salinger, and give him my gratitude."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"\\"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.\\"-- 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 (NKJV)An all too infrequent subject for literature is considering how following the Bible might impact one's life. In this case, a young woman (Franny Glass) reacts to the world's phoniness by continually repeating a brief \\"Jesus prayer.\\" In the short story, \\"Franny,\\" this subject is introduced in the context of a weekend date in New Haven before a football game. Franny's attempt to draw closer to God contrasts powerfully with the superficial concerns of Lane, her date.In the companion novella, \\"Zooey,\\" we see the more sensitive reaction of Franny's brother, Zooey, to her more prayerful life. His solution is to attack her motives and methods, weaknesses that she's well aware of.From both works, there's a haunting sense of being alone amid a secular world focused on trivia at a time when one is seeking to develop a spiritual foundation. Franny doesn't have a prayer partner to help her learn more about prayer and to develop her spiritual life. As a result, her foray leaves her weakened and vulnerable. The angst of the existentialist questions about the meaning of life comes through very strongly.While not being overt about it, J.D. Salinger is setting up the case for detachment as the solution to the pain of modern living, as a contrast to either playing the world's game or seeking to find a meaningful spiritual connection.I first read these works when they were initially published in book form in 1961. I didn't like Lane any better this time, but I wasn't as pleased with Zooey as I was on the initial reading. My reactions to Franny were about the same.For anyone on a search for God, don't just guide your life by one Bible verse. Draw from the whole Bible, learn the Gospel message, and spend time with believers who are interested in helping you find answers to your questions and concerns. At some point, the Holy Spirit will take over . . . something that doesn't happen in these works.It's good food for thought. Although the circumstances of the story are clearly dated into the 1950s, I think the search for spiritual meaning represented here is timeless."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I don't recall the last time I started and finished a book in the same day. \\"Franny and Zooey\\" grabbed my attention right away, with its sense of time and place in the early 1950s Autumn of the northeast (mostly in NYC) and the rapid development of the main characters, 20 year-old Franny, her Yale boyfriend, Lane Coutrell, and in the second chapter, her brother Zooey and mother, Mrs. Glass.I had a copy of \\"Franny and Zooey\\" given to me at least forty years ago, and I don't know why I waited so long to finally read it. But in some ways, I'm glad I did. Since that time I've become a fan of the book, \\"The Way of the Pilgrim,\\" which plays a central role in the story of Franny and Zooey.My biggest question upon completing \\"Franny and Zooey\\" is: will it cause people to pick up a copy of \\"The Way of the Pilgrim,\\" or will it repel them from this Russian spiritual classic? The reason I wonder this is because the main characters of Salinger's book are rather dysfunctional and not particularly spiritual, smoking incessantly and swearing non-stop, but when the subject of the Pilgrim and the Jesus Prayer come up, the dialog takes on almost sacramental tones. It's a contrast that is ironic, to say the least.Needless to say, I thought \\"Franny and Zooey\\" was a great read, proof that Salinger is rated among the classic authors for good reason. He packs an awful lot into these 202 pages, in a story that covers only two days in Franny's life (and only one in brother Zooey's life). There is much food for thought here in terms of psychology, philosophy, American history, theater and entertainment, but most importantly spirituality.As someone who likes to say the Jesus Prayer while going to sleep each night, I take exception with the way Salinger compares this prayer to the mantras and chants of other religions, but all-in-all his point is worthy of consideration as each reader explores his or her own path. But many of his other comments about the prayer, through Zooey's voice, are spot on and serve as an excellent introduction.This is a book that will stay with me for a long time. I feel like I connected with these characters and with their struggles in life.I'll close with a quote, as Zooey is speaking to Franny:\\"If you're going to say the Jesus Prayer, at least say it to Jesus, and not to St. Francis and Seymour and Heidi's grandfather all wrapped up in one. Keep him in mind if you say it, and him only, and him as he was and not as you'd like him to have been. You don't face any facts. This same damned attitude of not facing facts is what got you into this messy state of mind in the first place, and it can't possible get you out of it.\\" (page 170)"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"It was always a little embarrassing to admit that I hadn't read Franny and Zooey. In the literary world, I guess it's kind of the equivalent of a beauty queen admitting she wears dentures. Somewhere in between that admission and the other one (that I found \`Catcher in the Rye' tolerably okay but not a masterpiece) those who saw me in equal standing begin to hee and haw and slap their knees from mirth over my taste--as if I drink sherry to get drunk (I do).Well, now this lack is no longer a flaw to lug with me to the next book club meeting. I am properly initiated into the J.D. Salinger fan club. I loved Franny and Zooey. I loved Franny's entrance, her run-on letters to her lover, her ever so innocent religious fanaticism. I loved Zooey's interaction with Mrs. Glass, loved Zooey taking a bath, Franny's fragile breakdown, and Zooey's marvelous intentions and ultimate belief that no matter how tiny or clownish we are, we are all the \\"children of man.\\"The way it was put together, however sliced in interims, was hemmed with incredible talent. It was put together so elegantly, so mired in everyday dialogue, that I'll have to read it again to really get all the twists and turns and subtle metaphors that Salinger laid out like kitchen towels on the blank countertops of the un-inked page."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I loved this book. What a collection of interesting and sad characters all from the same family, the Glass family. This mainly focuses on the youngest siblings of seven children, Franny and Zooey.Both are actors, but Franny has come home from college, and is having a sort of breakdown. The book is divided into two segments, called \\"Franny\\" and \\"Zooey,\\" both focusing on Franny's breakdown, which is of a spiritual nature, and is caused by her aversion to all things being ruled by ego, and false collegiate attitudes, and involves her intonation of a Jesus prayer, over and over.Both Franny and Zooey have had a precocious upbringing in the Glass family, and were former panelists on a children's whiz kid like radio program. All the Glass children were former contestants. Zooey believes this upbringing, particularly the religious teachings of their older brothers Buddy and Seymour that has made them \\"freaks.\\"The dialogue in this book is very clever, and is divided into segments that almost have the quality of theater, beginning with the restaurant scene between Franny and boyfriend Lane, to Zooey's bathroom conversation with Bessie, the matriarch of the Glass family, and I've never heard a son talk to his mother the way Zooey talks to Bessie, and the final confrontations between Franny and Zooey. Salinger also provides biting criticisms of his own characters.The final religious revelations are interesting, and sweet, and presented in a way that is completely unique. I would say this is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Salinger is the master of irreverent prose, and he uses that mastery perfect use in this book, a study on the nature of ego, knowledge, &quot;establishment&quot; (imagine that in a Salinger book?!), and religious piety, to name a few of the ideas and themes that get tossed around.The setting and plot are simple: Salinger's Glass family returns, and we're given the dialog of three conversations and the entire contents of two letters -- that's it. But in that short space (and my edition of the book is only about 130 pages), Salinger manages to pack more than many writers can get into a book three times the size. He shows instead of telling.This is a must of those who like Salinger's earlier work, and is more compelling for me than &quot;Catcher.&quot;"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"What is truly extraordinary about this book is that J.D. Salinger has again succeeded in creating living people from paper and pen. How many of us will ever truly know our friends and family members to the depths of any of the Salinger characters. Anyone who has read this book is acutely aware that the plot and story line are never the true goals of this writer. Salinger is one of the rare writers who want to stimulate and arouse creativity in the minds of those who read. His goal is not to lead as so many of today commercially successful writers wish to do. That is perhaps why he has chosen to isolate himself. However, people, on the wholesale level, wish to be lead. Why, do you suppose, that &quot;How to Books&quot; and &quot;Self-improvement Books&quot; are the biggest seller of many publishers? The true talent of writing exists in a few writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Rilke, Keats, Shelley, the person who actually wrote Shakespeare etc... and of course J.D. Salinger. If you are a person looking to be lead or inspired by some directed message, please just go to a church or read some patriotic propaganda that may inspire you to hang the American Flag. But, if want to think beyond the constraints of form or be truly inspired to imagine and dream, this is one of many wonderful works that are available to you."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If you are a philosopher at heart and immensely interestedin the human psyche, then this book is integral for thought.I am not just writing this because I am fascinated by J.D.Salinger, rather these two stories explore religion,pyschology, the bonds among family members, and theeverpresent quest for a unique vision of life.&quot;Franny&quot; is the story of a troubled philosophical girl whois struggling to reconcile her thoughts on her world purposeand the conventions of daily existence. &quot;Zooey&quot; is the confidentolder brother who understands many things that his sister doesnot.

I don't recall much of the Zooey story, but the Franny story was stimulating to the extreme.

Thank you Franny for giving me the courage to possible be a complete nobody."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"At this point, I have finished all of the Glass saga that is printed in book form. I doubt, alas, that I shall have the gumption or masochism (whichever way you look at it) to go find the remainder on the IntarWub.I finished this book last of the Glass saga (including Nine Stories, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters, and Seymour: An Introduction). While it was better than the latter two novellas (largely bettered by the absence of Seymour: An Introduction), it still has all of the pretentiousness of some of the worst of Salinger.Particularly infuriating points, personally, include the asinine practice of italicizing approximately one third of any word longer than six letters for the majority of the saga. Whilst this would be understandable (and merely odious) if it were simply the precocious Glass children and their parents (or even including Grandpa Zozo, etc.), it spreads like a virulent cancer into other, non-family members. This transforms it from an obnoxious family trait of condescending verbal skills into purely bad writing. Ah, what a treat.Also, I enjoyed the final deconstruction of the vaunted Eastern tradition of the 1950's by Zooey Glass, even if it was immediately followed by an insipid, mawkish return to same a few pages later. Boys and girls, the East does not have the answers that the West has somehow lost. IT DOESN'T. It was refreshing to see Zooey bemoan the farcical training and teaching that Buddy and Seymour have given him, and it was nice to see a formal vilification of this kind of teaching, alas it is too late, since Salinger spends so much time admiring it in the other stories. :(That said, there was little commendable in either of these stories. The characters act like spoiled children, as we may well expect of the last two children of the Glass family. Their comments, their nauseating pleas for intelligence on the part of the remainder of the human race, are all that is called for by those who consider themselves above the rest of us. How sweet it would be if there was a point wherein the Glass children, one by one, or all at once, realized that they too are children of desire and that they are no better, indeed, no different, from the mooing bovine masses that surround them.No doubt, this review will be commented upon and negatively reviewed by the thousands who consider Salinger a latter day Jesus. Oh well. For those of you who are critically considering reading ANYTHING of the Glass saga, read Zooey, and then stop. Or, read A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Teddy, and Zooey, and then stop.

Franny chooses obssessive recitation of \\"Jesus Prayer\\" and her nervous breakdown seems the result of this split (Schzophrenic) between these two very important worlds in her life. Zooey, on the other hand, decides to choose what appears to be more functional (at least superficially) way to manage this agony, however, clearly without satisfaction. I didn't really like this book because of too much similarity to The Catcher in the Rye, but with less discipline in writing and the plot."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"The book is divided into two parts, \\"Franny\\" and \\"Zooey.\\" It's not so much a novel as a first short story that ends abruptly, begging more, and therefore engenders a second short story that tries to wrap it up. I have a feeling it makes more sense to readers in their late teens or early twenties (and preferably from New York) than it made to me as a much older reader. It's the manifestos of two bright, intellectual, strong-willed young people, but really more Zooey's than Franny's. It's great writing page by page but less successful as a whole than Catcher in the Rye. One of the virtues of Catcher is that Salinger doesn't make claims about preciousness or genius in Holden; so Holden comes off more human than Franny or Zooey--more tortured, more vulnerable, more a victim of his own time and psyche, more inviting of compassion and much easier to identify with. I wonder whether Salinger wanted to somehow get closer to Franny than he managed to do in F&Z. It's as though Zooey pirates the book and cuts us off from what might otherwise have been a great female counterpart story to Holden's."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I really enjoyed Salinger's novel Franny and Zooey more than Catcher in the Rye for which he is famous. This book leaves the reader a changed person. After reading this you question things like society, religion, education and your relationships with different people. I highly recommend this book and think it will open your mind to new ideas concerning things that many of us accept without questioning.

These kids (seven of them if I remember well) are the children of a showbusiness family from New York and they used to be genius-kids who appeared on a radio show answering quizzes and philosophizing. Apparently the Glass kids had a special education in an ecumenical religiosity and philosophy, and their situation as whiz kids has led to emotional distress, much a-la Holden Caulfield but more illustrated. By the way, in terms of its central themes, this book could be said to be the closing of the full circle of Caulfield's story. The Glasses, just like Caulfield, are intelligent people, very frustrated with the inadequacies of life in general and the people who surround them. They are very neurotic in a New York way. They are angry because people aren't as intelligent as they should be, and because the ways of the world are not what reason and humanism tell us they should be. How to cope with it?In the first story, Franny, a young college girl, arrives in New Haven (Yale) to be with her preppy and also intellectualizing boyfriend for a football weekend. They go to a cafe to have some food (and drinks and cigarettes). The story is simply the account of their talk. Salinger is one of the greatest masters of frenzied and fast dialogue, and it shows here. Franny is telling his boyfriend about all the phoniness of campus life, about the lunacy and presumptuosness of teachers and classmates. She tells him how she has read a book about a Russian monk who discovers a special Jesus prayer. If you repeat this prayer incessantly, it will become a part of you and repeat itself automatically, bringing you closer to grace and peace. The conversation starts getting out of hand as Franny gets carried away and as the boyfriend becomes rather estranged, until Franny collapses on her way to the restroom. When she wakes up, she is constantly whispering the Jesus prayer.In the second story, Franny is at her parents' home in NY, recovering from her nervous breakdown. In a long talk with her brother Zooey (both of them being the youngest Glass children), they confront each other's traumas, weaknesses, genius and problems with the world. Zooey is also extremely talented and aware of the inadequacies of the world, but he seems to be in a (slightly) better emotional phase than Franny. The dialogue is moving, neurotic and masterful. After they argue rather violently, Zooey goes to another room and calls Franny pretending to be an older brother living away. In a further conversation Zooey forces Franny to understand that following a simple but futile recipe will not do the trick. The Jesus prayer is not enough: we have to accept the world as it is as well as the people around us. We can not be \\"catchers in the rhye\\". But we should live an ethical life, just because (which made me think of Kant's \\"categorical imperative\\"). As Seymour Glass, the eldest brother, once said to Zooey, sometimes you have to do things \\"for the Fat Lady\\", that is, just because it is the right thing to do, even if no one will notice.\\"Frany and Zooey\\" is written in a lower key. It is unprententious, unlike its characters, but deep down it is about profound questions. How to cope with this mad world filled with people who are not bright nor good? Can you save the world? How to live? Yes, sometimes we have to do things we wouldn't like to do, but we have to do it, if only for the Fat Lady."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Many Salinger fans, upon reading Franny and Zooey, are quick to draw comparisons to Catcher In the Rye. That was exactly what I did the first time I read this novel nearly twenty five years ago; but after several years of lauding Franny and Zooey as the pinochle of Salinger's work, it dawned on me that while there are angry or confused youngsters who feel like societal misfits in each novel, they come from such different worlds that comparing the two stories is just, well... apples & oranges.What made Franny and Zooey more endearing to me was the family dynamics. In contrast to Catcher in the Rye's focus on Holden Caulfield's unhappiness as an individual, the nervous breakdown that Franny Glass suffers early in the story has more to do with being a member of the Glass Family than it does her individual anxieties. And unlike Holden, who is coping in the larger world, Franny suffers as a shut-in at the home she grew up in.I believe that most people who have dealt with well meaning but misguided families will find themselves drawn toward this story. The Glass Family is one of the finest examples of a large and dysfunctional family (before it was cool to be dysfunctional), with an emotionally charged but diverse collection of grown children dealing with the complexeties of their upbringing.The story focuses equally on Franny and her older brother Zooey. They are two youngest children in the Glass Family, raised by their parents and older siblings on vaudeville style entertainment, philosophy and intelligentsia. While Franny's breakdown seems a mystery to her and paralyzes her emotions, Zooey is pent up with anger and well too aware of the emotional wreckage their upbringing has left the Glass offspring to clean up. Feeling a bond with Franny as the two youngest children, Zooey wants to help his sister, but must first temper his rage and self destructive tendencies.Going into much more detail would be an injustice to anyone who has yet to read this story. In my opinion, this is a classic story of twentieth century Americana. From Zooey's self loathing to the dialogue between him and his busy-body mother to Franny's aggravation with her boyfriend Lane, J.D. Salinger gives us a portrait of a family in crisis, unequaled until The Ramones recorded the dark comedic \\"We're a Happy Family\\" years later. And no, I'm not kidding! Gabba Gabba!"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This was THE book of the 50's and early 60's, along with Catcher in the Rye. In some strange way, J.D. Salinger caught the angst of the young and thoughtful and they grabbed these books with both hands. But do they speak to youth (or anyone else) today?Well, maybe Franny and Zooey is worth a look. For one, take the fact that &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot; is on the best seller list now for weeks. This book recommends a fixed prayer, to be repeated as sort of a meditation. In Franny and Zooey, Franny, a brilliant and introspective teenager, comes home frantically repeating the &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot;, looking for some kind of metaphysical escape from herself. She's looking for some kind of Zen-like release from ego. Part of growing up is discovering who we are and we may not like everything we see. Part of maturation, much later on, is accepting even those flaws. But Franny wants an instant release from distasteful self-discovery, so she heads instead for destruction.Her brother Zooey saves her by an ingenious bit of sophistry; isn't focusing on escaping the self a form of egotism? He argues that her ideas are flawed and provides a lot of interesting arguments about her belief system. For example, his astute remarks that Franny disapproves of Jesus and is more sympathetic with Buddhism is strikingly akin to people today who feel strongly they must become vegetarian and disapprove of Christians and yet cannot say exactly why, except that they feel Christians criticize them and that animals are somehow innocent and all-loving. Consider this quote from Zooey:&quot;And the other thing you disapproved of- the thing you had the Bible open to- was the lines 'Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.' That was all right. That was lovely. That you approved of. But, when Jesus says in the same breath, 'Are ye not much better than they?'- ah, that's where little Franny gets off. That's where little Franny quits the Bible cold and goes straight to Buddha, who doesn't discriminate against all those nice fowls of the air. All those sweet, lovely chickens and geese that we used to keep up at the Lake.&quot;Salinger's uncanny depiction of the anguish of youth, coupled with Eastern mysticism and an eccentric but lovable family became a cult classic in the 50's. While Catcher in the Rye unerringly pinpoints the feelings of a teenage boy, Franny catches so much of the feelings of a girl that some analysts of the book have proposed that the real reason behind Franny's breakdown was that she was pregnant. I totally reject that notion, but it is interesting that her troubles are so well described that readers ascribe a typical teen trouble, rather than the fact that Franny, like Holden Caulfield, is facing maturity with fear and loathing. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"So says Franny to her college beau, Lane in response to his wondering why she quit acting in school. I love this line; and many more. After having read Catcher in the Rye & some of his short stories back in high-school (many years ago), I finally found the right time & place to pick up where I left off with Salinger. Franny & Zooey is a wonderful \\"second novel\\", and recaptured much of the plain language & straight-forward conversational rhythm that I remembered enjoying while reading Catcher in the Rye. There are lots of interesting reviews here about this book and how it's affected people. I truly understand now, how reading an important book at different stages of one's life can take on new significance, often in very different ways from the initial reading. Since this is my first time through Franny & Zooey, I feel obligated to compare it to Catcher. The many similarities between the two novels include the age of the main characters (college), connections with acting or actors/\\"hollywood\\", addiction to cigarettes (is there a single line in this book not spoken without a cigarette in hand?), and the confessional nature of conversation in which \\"family\\" looms large. But while Holden Caulfield, Franny, & Zooey all complain about the \\"phonyness\\" of the world around them, Holden seems (as I recall - it's been twelve years since I last read Catcher) more preoccupied with youth & preservation, while Franny & Zooey delve into religion. Ultimately, Franny & Zooey is about an existential crisis - Franny's hunger for religion & truth while feeling overwhelmed by the superficiality of pedantic professors, erudite intellectuals, and, well, her \\"lame\\" boyfriend himself. She is so overwhelmed that she faints at the restaurant.Enter Zooey. Zooey is a bit of an intellectual himself, as is the whole Glass family. Thus, the ironical nature of much of Zooey's \\"speaches\\". Salinger lets Zooey be long-winded and he takes up most of the novel. I think some readers might be put of by this, and it can be a trifle tiresome at times, but it does end up \\"feeling right\\" afterwards when Zooey's child-prodigy monster of a character shows its true colours. This unique characterization is one reason why Salinger is recognized as a great American writer. In any event, despite his condesending treatment of his mother, which comes across as strange, mean, and funny all at once, Zooey is ultimately just being himself. This monster, Salinger seems to be saying, is exactly what his parents \\"Les & Bess\\" have created. We learn that the oldest kid, Seymour has committed suicide, and the second oldest, Buddy, has moved far away (but is present in the form of a letter & in spirit). Zooey is taking a bath, smoking, and reading his big brothers letter. It looks like Buddy has thankfully \\"escaped\\" the grasp of this obsessive family - run Buddy, run! (Before leaving the bathroom, make sure you note Salinger's precise description of the medicine cabinet's contents - there are some telling details there). Ultimately, Zooey makes his way out to the living room (also described in excellent detail) where lays Franny, curled up in a ball with the family cat. By the end, the slightly older but more immature Zooey is finally acting like a big-brother should (although tellingly, incapable of a face to face conversation - you'll have to read & see for yourself), and manages to display some real wisdom. The conversation between the two of them revolves around the nature of ego, and religious impulse, and Zooey consults with his memories of Seymour & Buddy (his gurus, whether he likes it or not) in order to calm Franny down. He's been through it, and understands her very well. He tells her not to make these signifcant issues out to be \\"so damn personal\\". It's a great moment too, when Zooey starts talking to Franny about \\"the Fat Lady\\".As I write this review which I didn't imagine would become this long-winded (Zooey has infected me!) I realize that this book is deeper than Catcher, and perhaps more significant. I'm actually more impressed with its simplicity than its deep & meaningful subject-matter. Salinger's \\"greatness\\" is his wonderful ability to capture the beauty in something as seemingly mundane as two college kids sitting at a table, smoking, eating \\"snails & frog-legs\\", sipping martinis, and talking about themselves. You'll have no problem reading this book in one or two sittings, and then you'll come away from it thinking, \\"Wow! I need to re-read that some day, in some other place & time.\\" I still hear the Zen-like clapping of Zooey's hand(s)...One final note about Salinger. My impression is that there is no way he intended to stop writing (and I don't think he did) after Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters & Seymour. Yes, he stopped \\"publishing\\", but Franny & Zooey just feels too much like one face of a complex prism - that prism ultimately being a whole book of stories & novellas dealing with the Glass family. There's so much missing, it seems, in terms of the other family members, and especially the Mother & Father themselves. My guess is that one day, perhaps after Salinger's death as he seems to intend, we will have multiple \\"Franny & Zooey's\\" to compliment & fill out this incongruously short Glass saga . . . I, for one, look forward to the discovery & printing (& glorious fanfare!!) of a NEW Salinger story. It's just a matter of whether or not he chooses to be around for the zoo."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read Catcher in the Rye many years ago, and absolutely loved it, as much people do. However, I hadn't heard much about any of his other books, so recently I decided to look into it. This is when I fell upon Franny and Zooey. This book means a lot to me now for many reasons. It's a work of absolute genius. You can see hints of Holden in Zooey AND Franny, and I always like when an author makes subtle hints towards a different book. Franny and Zooey touches on everything - love, family, religion - and youth. The way Salinger portrays Franny to me is moving. She's this lovely young girl, who seemingly has everything for the taking; however, the road to adulthood makes her question EVERYTHING. Many young people question everything, and sometimes I don't think it's talked about enough. Salinger does it justice. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because you can definitely see what an influential author he was. Kurt Vonnegut HAD to have been an admirer. This book is fabulous, deep, and interesting. Who knows? It may make you look at life from a different perspective."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Salinger's critics (including the honorable John Updike, jealous perhaps?) denounce Salinger's great love for his Glass Family. Others criticize the message of this novel, a transcendent,soaring message of hope and forgiveness. Maybe these traits are not popular with the traditionally cynical critic's circle, but the message and style of this novel have changed my life. These couple of stories are written so beautifully and subtley, while eliciting a strong, immediate emotional reaction in the reader. Franny is an extraordinary girl, but a universal enough character that I am continually able to identify with her and her struggles with sprituality and the phoniness of ego and self-centeredness. Salinger has encouraged me to start writing, to maybe convey some sort of simple truth through the written word. This book, like &quot;Raise High..&quot; and &quot;Nine Stories,&quot; is mind bogglingly good. A masterpiece. Writer's should not be limited to the worldly, the material. Salinger dares to account for a greater force in our lives, and that's why we shine our shoes, even when we're on the radio."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I haven't read a Salinger book since Catcher in the Rye, which was 14 years ago. I wish I read this one sooner. As soon as I finished reading it, I flipped to the beginning and proceeeded to read it in its entirety a second time.What we have is a thought provoking story with a cast of very interesting, colorful characters. It is a story of identity in a world of institutions: religious, educational, and family; each with their own values and agendas, and how the characters navigate and marry these systems of beliefs and simultaneously attempt to maintain a sense of self-integrity. It follows the story of Franny, a young female college student, amist a nervous breakdown, as she attempts to find meaning and an inner sense of balance in a world she views as being phoney. Later in the book we are introduced to her brother, Zooey, who, though extrememly intelligent, battles his own demons while attempting to help his sister deal with hers.This book has a lot of depth and there are many, many ways to interpret various sections and their details, which is what makes it such a rich novel worth reading over and over again.Although, whoever said this book is all about &quot;love&quot; in their review above, really missed the point of the entire book and IMHO has no inkling of an idea what they are talking about."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book means to me what a good book should: it touches a part of my heart I didn't know could be touched by another human being. That's what I love so much about J.D. Salinger, the way he taps into the human psyche so adeptly. I can't think of any other authors that can deliver that way. And yet, if that's not the purpose of writing, what is?Franny and Zooey Glass are two hyper-critical, overanalytical young adults living on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Throughout the book, we watch Franny (f) go through the stages of a nervous breakdown while simultaneously turning to a phrase found in a religious book for guidance, and her older brother Zooey (m) try to help her while grappling with the same issues of modern society that she is. There is also their seemingly ignorant mother, who does nothing except agitate Zooey and pointlessly fawn over Franny, and the other members of the isolated, eclectic family.The arc of this book is amazing. I won't give away the lesson Zooey finally is able to impart to his sister, suffice it to say that Mrs. Glass doesn't look quite so bad when the story is finished."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"When they hear the name J.D. Salinger, most people immediately think of \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" which is far and away his most-popular book. If you bother to read the rest of Salinger's output, you find that most of it deals with the Glass family to one degree or another. From \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" in \\"Nine Stories,\\" to \\"Raise High The Roofbeam, Carpenter, and Seymour: an Introduction,\\" the Glass family was the focus of Salinger's efforts.Salinger's best can be found in \\"Franny and Zooey.\\"Sure, Franny is a histrionic drama-queen, and Zooey is a megalomaniacal, friendless jerk, who treats everyone around him as second-rate, but by the book's end, you understand how their childhoods (or lack thereof) have molded them this way.Franny has a sort of nervous breakdown, and she decides that reciting \\"The Jesus Prayer,\\" as prescribed in a little book called \\"Journey of the Pilgrim,\\" will eventually grant her peace. Her know-it-all brother, Zooey, lays into her, telling her that if she's going to pray \\"The Jesus Prayer,\\" she needs to understand who Jesus was, and not picture Him as St. Francis of Assisi, somebody's grandmother, and their dead eldest brother, Seymour, rolled up into one. There are lots of philosophies and religious doctrines batted around, but it all boils down to a difficult brother caring for his difficult sister.I've read this book ten times, at least, and the most satisfying have been when I read all the Zooey lines aloud. (Yes, this must confuse the hell out of my neighbors, but the dialogue is so strong and rich, that it cries out to be heard and spoken, not just read silently.)Try \\"Franny and Zooey.\\" If you can forgive the two title characters, you'll find a rich and rewarding read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If you read 'Catcher in the Rye' and enjoyed it, you will probably find some of the themes familiar here in this fine but less well-known work. There are two chapters, the first short chapter serves to set the scene and introduce the second. Two Ivy League students meet for a date. The young man is an insensitive intellectual jock. He wants an audience for his loud intellectual pretensions and to have sex, simultaneously if possible. Franny, the young woman, a highly sensitive person, is struggling at college and having a spiritual crisis. She wants to be herself, have integrity, wonders why people play so many games and act out so many unauthentic roles. She wants to feel accepted, and to know the meaning of life. She is still young enough to be able think about life's big questions and feel the pain of having no answers.In chapter two Franny has returned home to recover her equilibrium, and Zooey her older brother, who is an actor, is in the bath reading a script. Their mother, a remarkable character in her own right, is worried. And rightly so. She thinks Zooey ought to talk to his sister to help her. He proceeds to do so in his own particular and unique way. The characters are all wonderfully described, the jock, the mother, Franny and Zooey. The whole 'action' revolves around the dialogue, mostly verbal fencing, but this is no mere novel of manners. Franny, the mixed up kid, is trying to sort it all out with the aid of a little book 'The Way of a Pilgrim', which is the real-life autobiography of an anonymous Russian beggar in the 1850's, and a spiritual classic in the Christian Eastern Orthodox tradition. The central theme is 'The Jesus Prayer', which a personal meditative prayer. Zooey tries to explain it all to her, but as I have read Pilgrim myself I can tell you he makes a complete fist of it, he mixes it all up with Buddhism and Hinduism. Whether or not he helps, hinders, or does as much harm as good towards her recovery I'll let you read for yourself, it's well worth the effort. I found this book to be a good read, the characters are so real, I felt like I would know them if I met them, but all in all this .... ...."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Yes, quite a lovely story, as all of Salinger's works are. I just wanted to briefly mention this: I read, just days after reading Franny and Zooey for the first time, &quot;The Way of the Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;The Pilgrim Continues the Way,&quot; the two volumes of the one book that the girl reads. Though I am not theistic, I found that book particularly wonderful, written in a thoughtful, modest fashion by an anonymous russian pilgrim about a hundred years ago. I greatly recommend &quot;The Way of the Pilgrim&quot; for those true fans of Franny and Zooey."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is perfect for anyone who's ever wondered why we do certain things in life and why we should.

I own a well worn copy and read it at least once every month"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This novel- really two short stories- is amazing. It is about religion, but isn't preachy. It details a girl's nervous breakdown, but isn't melodramatic.

I had no idea what I was missing. I have fallen in love with JD Salinger and since then picked up Nine Stories by him as well. I am taken away when I read him, I can say that I fully enjoy every moment of his writings so far. He is dry, and rough, and very descriptive. If you have only read Catcher in the Rye and think that you don't enjoy Salinger...give Franny and Zooey a try, it will be a breath of fresh air, and make you think too.I enjoyed the book and the characters and all, but that was completely secondary to what I got out of the book. It is almost like I got what I did despite the fact that the book talks about a group of wonderbread kids who have life so easy that they try and make it complicated. I realised that I did have a hard time tolerating their fainting spells, and when they insulted their mamma and called her fat and such. I began to see them as more spoiled and less actually practising what they knew.It seems that Salinger could have chosen to use these wealthy, upper class, wonderbreads because of the impact it could have on the reader. It is easier to take something from a preacher who you can see does not have it all together either, you can relate to him...and maybe that is why the author chose to do it that way. Maybe he was mocking the whole idea, as in these are they only type of people who can afford to mope around and recite little prayers....who knows what he meant to do...I do know what I got from it though. You really need to read it, to know what I mean by not knowing what you get from it after reading it...I think the conclusion could be different for almost every reader.

I will say that the first time i read it, there were times that i felt it was dull, and almost put it down, but it only gets better. By the time i was through it, i couldn't believe i ever doubted it. It is a book to read if you want questions presented, not answers. I think the point of the book, and much of the discussions between franny and zooey, is the questions, not necessarily the resolutions. This is a book that grows with a person. A book that srtikes a new chord every time I read it. I reccommend it highly to anyone at all. It's a deep book, but reads like a light novel. It leaves you thinking about things naturally, you don't find yourself irritated and struggling to deseipher the meaning; you long to desipher it. You crave to understand it, which is why this book is an investment. This is not a book you read once and forget. It ia a book you read for the first time over and over again."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I believe that this book is the possible explanation of the use and invention of god.

Shine your shoes for the fat lady."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read most of Salinger's works, and I find it hard to decidewhich one is the best, Catcher in the Rye or Franny and Zooey. Frannyand Zooey is about the religion of people. Religion in the sense of understanding the purpose of our existence, why we live and what or whom we live for. Franny exemplifies one who is searching for meaning in her life, one who refrains from the world she sees because of its superficiality. Zooey, on the other hand, experienced this inner struggle before and had come to a deeper understanding of what life is about and how to live this life. The dialogue between Franny and Zooey is amazing, which only demonstrates Salinger's insight on human existence. Zooey helps Franny to come to an understanding not by preaching but by relating to her in a way that she can understand, namely the Fat Lady in their childhood. The story offers an answer to why we should find what we do best and fulfill that potential. To live the fullest is to be religious. Salinger implies that each person has this religion within. One only needs to discover and understand."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"First of all I must say that Franny &amp; Zooey is one of those books that I &quot;love to death&quot;.

Next, a recommendation: If you liked Franny &amp; Zooey you should perhaps read Oscar Wilde's De Profundis because it is about love, too, and also &quot;hinges on mysticism&quot;. That and because Dr. Suzuki also mentions it in one of his essays..."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Everyone always told me never to read anything by Salinger except Catcher in the Rye because it was all anticlimax, but wow!

It's incredible!"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is the thing about all of Salinger's stuff - you read it and then you believe in the people he writes about, and they've GOT to exist out there somewhere, how can they NOT? I read Franny on the train one day and I honestly thought I was reading about my life. Extract from my diary that day: &quot;Wow. I read the best book 'Franny' by my man J D Salinger, basically about this couple going out for lunch and exposing their incompatibilities. And I can see so much of me and [my ex] in it, have to get him to read it, though he'd hate it coz he hates J D Salinger, which goes to show we're incompatible really but I didn't like to think that.&quot; So there I was, raving and raving about it, and I leant it to a friend once and her comment was 'Well, nothing really happens' How can you say that? Maybe nothing material, but that's exactly what it's all about. If you want superficial action, read trash, which is far from this. So it's all about the spirit but that's so much more interesting and inspiring and anything more is not the point, it's the way Salinger writes it, it's the way everything's so real and you know exactly what he means. You just have to appreciate the beautiful simplicity and not be dragged down by this modern materialism, which is just what the book's getting at. And if you've missed that you'll never get it."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I was drawn into this book, from the very first page, by Salinger's word dropping: Yale and collegiate. These points of reference are then essentially proved to be the antagonistic societal thresh-holds by which we are held captive. Salinger cares about his readers, by allowing them to hear his upmost intellectual and spiritual thoughts, but at the same time, he doesn't care if the reader can't keep up with his ramblings. This book delves deeply into the oxymoronic American society of faux-intellectuals, by showing Franny as the unassuming and confused epitome of reality in thought. At the same time, I feel Salinger is actually mocking himself, and her, and notably the reader. This is, without a doubt, an intense voluntary, literary sword-fight between us and him. Franny's key to life lies not only within herself, but within her family, within God, and within nothing. It's hard to describe this (i.e. no cliff notes), as it is hard to describe how much I incidentally adored this book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"when i read this for the first time, i was disapointed it was not more like catcher in the rye.

In college you absorb everything, and you feel everything 1000 times more than any other tome of your life. Salinger perfectly captures this in his story."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"If you, like me, hated Catcher in the Rye, PLEASE do yourself a favor and take another look at Salinger. This work is cynical like Catcher but it has an underlying theme of deep love and intelligence. Insightful Salinger knows people, knows the world, and presents his views succinctly and humorously. It's dry, it's a slice of another world. Short and delightful."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"It seems as though F&amp;Z either works for you or it doesn't. To me, it's a story of realization, subsequent disillusionment, and ultimate epiphany. But, now, what in American literature isn't? Undoubtedly, JDS is an intricate mind. True he's a bit pretentious -- but he backs it up with artistry and wisdom. F&amp;Z displays genius, style, and humor. I regret that those who complain that it's not &quot;Catcher&quot; missed, really, a great deal of what Holden was about. Perhaps the hesitant reader should start with &quot;Nine Stories.&quot;"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"The first story, &quot;Franny&quot;, is by itself a marvelous read (and yes, I think it is rather ambiguous whether she is pregnant). The second story, &quot;Zooey&quot;, doesn't have the same light touch, and the reader can't help but feel the oppressive weight Franny must have suffered under the tutelage of her pedantic older brothers. It is interesting to compare the ending of Franny to the ending of Zooey. In both, Franny attains enlightenment and at least momentary peace, in the first story through chanting the &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot; and in the second story through the realization that Jesus (Zooey's Fat Lady) is in everyone and that we live in his universal audience.If one is not careful, it would seem that Zooey's message to Franny is a repudiation of the spiritual enlightenment of the &quot;Way of the Pilgrim&quot; and that Franny accepts the revelation. Is this a victory of Christian spirituality over Buddhist enlightenment? Isn't it a bit odd that Zoo! ey, whose exhausting lectures and insensitivity drive Franny to tears, is the angel who delivers this message? Upon more careful consideration, however, the reader should see that continual prayer to God and recognition of God's continual ubiquity are actually two sides of the same coin. Perhaps Salinger was trying to dramatize the difference between self-enlightenment and force-fed spirituality. Even if the two messages are the same, the former makes for a better read and can be done in a third of the pages.There is clearly tremendous dysfunction in the Glass family, and I think overachievers everywhere will get chills up their spine as they relate to Salinger's characters. But even non-overachievers can relate to the anguish of adolescents learning how to discover who they are and to live for themselves instead of trying to match others' expectations."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny &amp; Zooey is one of those books where you have to go back and re-read to make sense of it all. I loved it. I found it a nice contrast to J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, which totally overwhelmed me with cynicsm. I love what Zooey has to say about Jesus- that who esle would have stayed silent when questioned by Pilate, and that you can't modify him to suit your needs. What I loved most of all was the Fat Lady! I picked up on a sense of random acts of kindness and art for art's sake. Franny's breakdown is another example of trying to escape from a broken world and I found the voice of Franny similar to Holden's in The Catcher in the Rye- cynical and phoney ego hating. This was a book I'll have to read every year!"},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Due to the suicide of Seymour Glass, Franny's religious beliefs are fluctuating. Franny was never able to accept religion before her brother's suicide. However, now that she is trying to &quot;find herself,&quot; she is caught up in the vast world of religion. Her obvious relationship with religion is illustrated through the book she continues to carry around. She tries to fall back on it, by praying incessantly. However, through her subconscious thoughts she is depicted as never being able to accept religion. Though people continue to try to offer Franny guidance, there remains a reason for her searching and nervous breakdown. Franny's searching is an obvious result of her brother's suicide. Since the tragic event, she is constantly seeking guidance, but cannot accept it. The one religious element she holds onto is her book, &quot;The Way of the Pilgrim.&quot; It gives her reason to believe that she will get over the suicide. The peasant looking for prayer without ceasing found his way, found his path in life through religion. She sees the novel's sequel as her sequel, that if she prays incessantly, she could get over her troubles. Jesus Christ is the person she falls back on. She tells herself that she does not directly believe in Jesus, &quot;But the thing is, the marvelous thing is, when you first start doing it, you don't even have to have faith in what you're doing. I mean even if you're terribly embarrassed about the whole thing, it's perfectly all right.&quot; In this case, she uses herself as an example, she cannot say to herself she fully believes that praying incessantly will make her get over her problems. However, she feels she needs some sort of help. By using this &quot;Jesus prayer&quot; she tries to escape the superficiality and corruptness of life that she feels, now that Seymour died and life has deceived her. Deep within, she knows she is doomed; she knows inside that no religion can help solve her psychological problems. Since the death of Seymour, her angers continuously frustrate her. She is constantly contradicting Lane, her boyfriend. With everything she contradicts him about, she feels inside she is getting her frustrations out. When in fact, she is taking it out on the wrong people. Her relationship to her religion subconsciously led to her nervous breakdown. She won't accept guidance or help because she cannot take the criticism. When Zooey is telling her that praying incessantly will not work, she knows she can't take it, so she acts as if she didn't hear him. At home, she separates herself from the family. She barely talks to them, and will not take her mom's guidance. &quot;I tried-not a half hour ago-to get her to take a nice cup of chicken broth.&quot; Through her mother's continuous offering of chicken soup and psychoanalysis, her mother is trying to open up, to help guide Franny through her problems. However, Franny is relentless to accept guidance, from which she will get criticism. This criticism that she worries about will show her that life has once again deceived her.When Seymour died, it made Franny change her view of religion. Originally, her family was split religions, so her parents taught all the kids all religions. &quot;This is, we wanted you both to know who and what Jesus and Gautama and Lao-tse and Shankaracharya and Hui-neng and Sri Ramakrishna, etc...&quot; She needed something to fallback on. She saw a way to be part of a religion, which supposedly works. Starting off, she would not even have to have faith in what she was doing. It fit a description of a religion perfect for her. However, the constant doubt remained in her mind that this was too easy to solve her problems. Religion is much vaster and more complicated then just this. However, consciously she could not acknowledge or accept it. When she was finally able to see it, she had a nervous breakdown.Religion in the perspective of Franny Glass was way too simple. By simply repeating &quot; 'Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me,' &quot; she felt she could get rid of her problems, as the peasant and other people did in &quot;The Way of the Pilgrim.&quot; However, with an inability to take criticism as Franny had, she could never accept there is more than just that to religion."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I'm a pretty big J.D. Salinger fan, having previously read The Catcher in the Rye and Nine Stories and enjoyed both but with this book I found it very hard to finish, despite the fact that it is only 202 pages. Its pretty slow reading and not a lot is happening in the book. It all basically takes place in the Glass flat in NYC and there are 4 main characters, Franny, Zooey, Franny's mother and boyfriend. It's all about the Jesus Prayer and finding out about religion for Franny and how she lives her life.All Salinger is doing in this book is putting down some tidbit of his philosophy down in fiction form with characters. Only real big Salinger fans should attempt to read this and if you're only wanting to read a Salinger book stick with The Cathcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I highly recommend the two stories &quot;Frannie&quot; and &quot;Zooey&quot;. The stories are complex, dealing with philosophy, psychology, and religion, but the simple, central, universal theme is love. Almost everyone can relate to the characters Zooey, Frannie, Lane, Bessie, Buddy, their father, etc. and either shares characteristics with them or knows someone who does. Criticizing others for being &quot;phony&quot; is not a happy way to live as Franny and her brother Zooey demonstrate. Everyone is &quot;phony&quot; in some way and has faults and flaws; that is why almost everyone who reads this book can relate to it. Too much cynicism and criticism is unhealthy. The simple way to combat them is to love; love people, yourself, life, etc. even if they are flawed. Buddy's fat lady is in all of us and epitomizes love. Salinger's work does not carry a new, radical, profound message; his true genuis is how he states it with very human characters and realistic insights that leave the reader saying &quot;Yes! I've felt that way before!&quot; &quot;I've read in the bath tub, and my mother disturbed me the whole time!&quot; &quot;I've felt lost at college when I couldn't decide what I wanted to do with the rest of my life!&quot; and so many others. These characters and dilemmas are timeless which truly marks oustanding literature."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Hi! I would like to get as much information about the plot as possible.

Don't love it because it is another trial in the Glass Family saga. Love it because the man, the myth, the genius -- JD Salinger, can make you feel. His words describe situations like no other in his time. Just the last page, when Franny lies back in the bed with all or none of the knowledge in the world belonging to her -- that is poetry! Read this book!! I implore you! You won't be sorry... you will thank me, and this legendary scholar who searched for inspiration himiself, and allowed us to find it in him."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I am a big fan of Salinger's work, Catcher in the Rye in particular. Based on the recommendations of others, I chose to read this selection. Based on the high standards I have for Salinger, I am somewhat dissappointed.Franny and Zooey are similar to Our freind Holden in &quot;Catcher...&quot; in many ways. They are all very good at finding the flaws in others. Where this book differs from &quot;Catcher...&quot; is that Salinger gives a solution to how the characters can get past these issues. Whereas the ending was somewhat predictable in hindsight, I never saw it coming. Nevertheless, I believe this book is well worth your trouble to read."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"Franny and Zooey is an excellent book that forces the reader to get into the characters' heads and draws the reader into a search within oneself. It is a beautifully written story of two people who know that they are different and that phony people are everywhere. Franny becomes obsessed with the &quot;Jesus prayer&quot;, and has a nervous breakdown. Zooey shows Franny that her obsession with the &quot;Jesus prayer&quot; is just another example of phoniness. This book really allows the reader to get wrapped up in the characters and identify with the characters in a wonderful way. A very incredible book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This book was almost a hassle to get through. As much as I liked &quot;Catcher&quot; I didn't much care for this one. It's one of those that is easy to put down. Stick to his other works and read this one only if you want to read them all."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"When I was reading it I felt nothing. It was just an average book- good writing, but no meaning. As I go over it I reaize all the symbolism, the chicken soup, the snowman paper-weight, and foremost religion.Due to the suicide of Seymour Glass, Franny's religious beliefs are fluctuating. Franny was never able to accept religion before her uncle's suicide. However, now that she is trying to &quot;find herself,&quot; she is caught up in the vast world of religion. Her obvious relationship with religion is illustrated through the book she continues to carry around. However, through her subconscious actions she is depicted as never being able to accept religion. Though people continue to try and give Franny guidance, there still remains the reason for both her searching and her nervous breakdown."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 14 at my father's behest. I loved it then as much as I do now. That first time, I fell in love with Zooey, and like another reviewer here, wanted to be a part of the Glass family. I still do. That is why I am attempting to put together all of the Glass family stories in chronological order so that a clearer picture can be gained. I believe that these stories are Salinger's best work.BUT COULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE ANYONE GOT THE IDEA THAT FRANNY IS PREGNANT????????? If someone knows where that idea came from, please clarify; personally, I don't believe it is in there, and perhaps the reviewer who says she is missed the entire theme and purpose of the work. That review would turn me away from a work that truly deserves to be read. It is not, as that review implies, a cheap look at a todry girl and her semi-annoying brother. I would re-evaluate that synopsis."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"The book Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger is made up of two fictional stories about a brother and a sister, from the Glass Family, who are struggling with their perspectives on life and religion. The two stories connect with each other, and Salinger has a couple of books that deal with characters from this family.Franny is a young lady who is having a hard time relating to any of her teachers or peers at her college and took up reading a book about the journey of a prophet to find understanding or enlightenment. And her brother Zooey, who is a good looking actor in his early twenties; he is trying to help her get over herself but is pretty stubborn and is doing this the wrong way.I would say that if you are looking for a book with suspense and lots of action this wouldn&#65533;t be the best book for you to read. It is not a simple story but there is no climax. Most of the book is giving the reader an in depth description of the characters and their emotions; which is something Salinger does in his stories a lot and he does it very well.I found the book to be very enlightening, not because it is a religious story, but because it gives you a perspective on life and human behavior. Anyone who has read some of J.D. Salinger&#65533;s work and enjoys his writing should consider reading this book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I was lent this book by a friend and read it hesitantly, thinking I would be bored by it, but I was not!This book is a great book about growing up and facing reality. I enjoyed the characters lives and felt for them.I wish I have read Catcher in the Rye to draw a parallel to this book, but I have not."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I must respond to the previous reviewer (although I already have a lengthy review of my own) and say that this book is anything but cynical. The message is that Franny's denunciation of the &quot;section men&quot; and all the other &quot;phonies&quot; is wrong because each one of those people represents a piece of Christ, they are the &quot;fat lady.&quot; It's a pity that these high school kids who wrote the review might be too young, or more likely just too ignorant (heck, they're my age), to understand the book."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I like to sprinkle in a few \\"classics\\" with my reading ritual. I am not sure if J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey is a true classic, but I'm counting it. I remember in my final semester of High School English that someone chose this book for their final project and presentation, but I could not remember anything about it.The book is divided into two parts and as I understand it, it was written as two separate short stories first published in the mid-1950's in The New Yorker magazine. The first third of the book centers on Franny on a date with Lane. Essentially we watch a nervous breakdown of Franny while on the date. We don't know why, there seems to be some religious undertone, or possibly anorexia. The section ends with Franny collapsing at the restaurant mumbling a prayer-like chant.The second third of the book centers on Zooey and his relationship with his sister, Franny, and the rest of his dysfunctional family. And we are talking about dysfunctional with a capital D.The final third of the book (not a separate section, just the final half of Zooey) revolves around a discourse between Franny and Zooey. Franny believes that she has found religion in two obscure pious guide books, The Way of the Pilgrim and The Pilgrim Continues His Way. These are real books by the way and you can find translations at your favorite book stores. Zooey is at complete odds with Franny, seeing her path to enlightenment as being hypocritical.There is a lot of deep religious debate and philosophy in the discussions between Franny and Zooey and this may explain why the book was not as popular as The Catcher in the Rye. There are quotes from the Bhagavad-Gita, discussion on enlightenment as being materialistic, and overall religious hypocrisy.The ending is not as gripping as that of The Catcher in the Rye, though Salinger really leaves it open as to whether or not Franny has found enlightenment or has found peace in Zooey's arguments.I know a lot of people compare Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar to The Catcher in the Rye, calling it the female version, but I have never seen that connection. However, reading the first third of the book, seeing Franny fall apart, instantly reminded me of The Bell Jar. No, they are not the same, there is really no parallel, but I had a similar feeling in my stomach as I read bout Franny as I did with Plath's alter ego Esther.I found the book difficult to read having to go back a read some sections over several times. But I also found the book difficult to put down. I'm not sure why given how difficult it was to read. Perhaps it was the religions study I found so captivating. I don't think I could recommend this book to anyone, unless you would be willing to struggle through it just to get to the religious discussion, which was worth it for me.For more details, go to aj.huff.org.

It didn't really have a clear theme or conflict. The characters were very confusing. It was hard to follow their actions. Franny is an immature girl, who needs help and doesn't want to receive it. Zooey is an sarcastic, cynical and very unpleasant. I didn't really like how it was divided up into sections. At first it starts out with Franny, and a couple of pages later, it turns into Zooey, making it a very rough transition. They were originally two newspaper articles. After reading Catcher in The Rye, and liking it, I thought this novel would be worthwhile, but it turned out to be a total waste of time."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is a great book about two robots who become enotionally attatched to one another! It doesn't say anywhere is the book that they are robots, but if you're smart, you just know they are.I would consider this Salinger's best work, and definately his most daring, as he steps out into the realm of robots and artificial intelligence.This book is moving, and makes one wonder about the future of robots and computers and Bill Cosby even makes a Cameo (They never tell you it's Bill Cosby though, they just say it's some guy)."},{"Title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"This is a book about a brother and a sister.

Franny is pregnant.If she is pregnant, her search for the meaning of her curtailed life in the pre-abortion 1950s makes sense. And her self-crisis is palatable. Her aspirations are crushed and she is doomed to, at best, suburban life with Lane (her lame boyfriend).So, she had aspired to be a great actor, and her famous actor older brother, in the wake of this disaster, this Titanic of dreams, lays on the floor and ridicules her escape mechanism, her \\"Jesus prayer.\\"If she isn't pregnant, she is just another addled 1950's post-adolescent. And her self-crisis is no more interesting than some other 20-year-old's naive obsession with video games, or clothing, or cars, or boys, or religion even.Evidence, counselor? \\"'You know how long it's been?' Lane (have I mentioned that he is her lame boyfriend?) said. 'When was that Friday night? Way the hell early last month, wasn't it?' He shook his head. 'That's no good. Too goddam long between drinks. To put it crassly.'\\"So they had sex a MONTH ago! To quote Avril Lavigne, \\"Can I make it any more obvious?\\"Also, Franny is nauseous. My goodness, do the English Dons need a pelvic exam to clarify this?Zooey being a jerk to a sibling undergoing a spiritual crisis is unpleasant.

This strange and yet poignant tale of a 17 year old boy haunted by the ghosts of his brothers, and living under the shadows of his tyrannical but loving father make is a story filled with twists and turns, leaving the reader constantly startled and amazed at the vibrancy of its prose. As in most Purdy's work, themes of homosexuality and sadomasochism are rife, but in this one, the themes are more subtle, and hence more suggestive. I would recommend this powerful, frightening and at times funny work to any of Purdy's fan - and if you are not, this book may help you become one. Surely, Purdy has got to be one of America's finest novelist - his sense of timing and dialogue is trule superb. Although I find his other works - like \`On Glory's Course' and \`Eustace Chisolm and the Works' more thematically powerful, this novel is nevertheless another testimony of this great writer's fine craftmanship."},{"Title":"Wind, whales, and whiskey: A Cape Breton voyage","review":"Anyone who enjoys sailing, geography, nature and down-to-earth people will enjoy this book.

It tries to be \\"al-la scientific\\", talking percentage and such, but as a research, it has no significant value. As education, it's a bench of stories with very little value or interest. And as reading, it is plain boring. Basically, it's light porn that dress up as a book. If you look for porn, go online. You can get on the web tons of hotter stuff. As a book about \\"sex in silicon valley\\", it doesn't tell you anything. I, for example, expected to see chapters, not stories, covering the subject. Not 300 people expressing some of their experience, in some cases, even before they came to silicon valley. Tell us where the guys at Silicon valley find dates, how the interactions goes. What happens in a small workplace where all workers are young, single, and don't have a life. Tell us how do people from different countries deal with it. Tell us about the married guys in this situation. Tell about the meeting point of ego, money, and sex. Tell us some gossip about large companies we all know about. Tell us what do those who don't do - do. Spice it with some anecdotal stories, but give us something interesting and valuable to read. That's what books are all about.

In World War I, Germany stationed many cruisers around the world to support its worldwide set of colonies. The largest of these forces was the German East Asiatic Fleet with a set of two heavy cruisers and three light crusiers. With the subtraction of the Emden and the addition of the Dresden, this fleet waged war on the British in both the Pacific and Atlantic. The fleet destroyed two British cruisers off Colonel and was itself destroyed off of the Falkland Islands. This happened in the early stages of the World War. This book tells of the trevails and exploits of the German East Asiatic Squadron.Hoyt's books are always interesting, even though he has written over 80 of them. There is no groud breaking academic material in this or his other books, just a solid story of man against the elements. A nice little read of a forgotten element of World War I."},{"Title":"Faster Than Sound: The Story of Supersonic Flight","review":"Mr. Gunston's book cover a wide range of aviation topics.

And how at the time Derek lived in a big brick warehouse in the then abandoned (now gentrified) Southbank of the City near Tower Bridge, with a Victorian glass greenhouse for a bedroom set in the middle of the large loft space.I remembered the article and wanted to see his garden. I remembered that soon after Derek Jarmen discovered he had HIV he bought the small cottage which is the subject of this book.Seeing the garden was very revealing of Derek's mindset. To pronounce the name Dungeness correctly you must say the word &quot;dungeon-ess&quot;. The few cottages there were built especially for those who were brought to this desolate area to work at the Dungeness Nuclear Power Plant. The Plant dominates the view because of the comparative height and size, and is obviously the most important &quot;plant&quot; in the garden. When you visit Derek's garden you will also be struck by how loud the humm of the nuclear plant is even though it is set a mile or so away, and the humm is constant -- it does not stop. The ground is covered with big 1- 2&quot; diameter peebles. Nothing soft, nothing comfortable and with that constant humming that never stops.The cottage itsself is a simple wooden structure that is stained black with windows painted a bright &quot;Caution&quot; yellow.

Unfortunately, it is just a mere work of fiction which has only the slightest ties to historical fact. In fact, the Library of Congress cataloging data inside the book shows that the book is a work of fiction. There is also no mention that this is a book written for young adults.

Flipping through the first pages, I was delighted to see that it was told in narrative form and hoped that it would have a delightful story with historically accurate details peppering the story. In some ways, the book held true to those hopes, but unfortunately, no. A pervasive tone of sentimentalism in the author's voice took an exciting string of events in the fictional life of a young girl and made it almost indigestible. Halfway through the book, I fell to dozing, then made myself finish the read only to cringe and groan as the painfully overdone passages became more frequent and increased in length. The illustrations also did the book no favors, ranging from disturbing (see the page where the family falls into a river) to simply lifeless.If I were to sum up the book in word, I'd call it \\"quaint\\".

Those notorious bandits they stumble upon don't stand a chance when Buster's Band dazzles, or rather startles, them with their latest tune.Ernest Franklin's energetic illustrations make every page an eyeful that enhances Hillerman's spare and witty style of storytelling.

AS is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing/integration and is on the autism spectrum. It also affects communication.Many people on the a/A spectrum don't care for hugs and find them intrusive and just endure them to appease others. For many people with AS, hugs can be a sensory onslaught that can include an aversion for the feel of scratchy beards; perfume or body odor; the feel of the hugger's clothing and the feel of being enclosed in a seemingly \\"restrictive\\" fashion. Many children on the a/A spectrum dislike loud displays of affection. For neurotypical (NT) counterparts, the natural response when confronted with an adverse response to hugs is to draw the erroneous conclusion that people on the a/A spectrum are devoid of affection.The book takes its title from the Beatle coiffed character Mr. Spock of \\"Star Trek\\" fame. The title character, Mr. Spock is clinical, analytical and seemingly devoid of emotion. Sadly, a misperception that people with AS lack emotion still exists. The term \\"Mr. Spock,\\" when applied to persons on the a/A spectrum was humorous. People with AS often have a novel way of making assessments and that can be found in the following example. I knew a Beatle fan, a young boy with AS who said of Mr. Spock, \\"He has a Beatle haircut and so do I. He's like me because of that and because he can figure things out. I read that the guy who made Mr. Spock up likes the Beatles.\\" I like his reasoning.Since AS is a sensory condition, feeling is what underscores a/A (autism/Asperger's) behavior and responses. Meeting the needs of all involved, the NT and the person on the a/A spectrum can be found in this book. People on the spectrum have heightened sensory modes; sounds are amplified; odors are stronger; tastes are more pungent and tactile contact more intense. The \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome comes into play because for many people on the spectrum, regulating emotions and \\"decoding\\" the facial expressions and responses of others is difficult. \\"Coming even\\" after being bombarded with sensory stimuli often appears in a blunted affect which again reinforces the \\"Mr. Spock\\" syndrome.Still, this is an excellent book for adults on the spectrum and for those directly involved with them. It brings to mind June Carter Cash's beautiful words of loving fairness, \\"I'll meet you halfway.\\" We need more books like this."},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"Looking at other reviews I seem to be the only person who doesn't like this book very much. I think that is mostly because it just isn't the sort of story I enjoy or identify with, and that may be partly because I have AS myself... I don't know. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book though, particularly women who have experienced failed relationships with AS men and who would identify with the author and may find it reassuring that the break down of the relationship was about mutual incompatibility rather than any failing on their part. However, I wouldn't recommend this as the first or only book you read on Asperger's Syndrome. This is just one person's story told from a specific perspective. It's good for what it is but I feel uncomfortable with the idea of people forming opinions about someone like me based solely upon it."},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"This book was brilliant in it's clearness right from the start on Aspergers and the way it manifests in people. Right from the beginning - I found myself going ... yes, that's my ex, and that, and that. Having someone else so clearly identify things was amazing. It is written from the perspective of someone who fell in love with someone with Aspergers and the things that happened. It helped me enormously understand 3 of my ex's who are on different levels with Aspergers. And 2 of whom I suspected. But my last one I was deeply baffled by for a long time until I had an inkling about Aspergers.Like the writer of this book. I am also involved in psychology. But found it just baffling at times WHAT was actually going on. Things didn't fit together. I spent a long time puzzling over various things that just didn't gel on some level with my last man. 'One of these things does not go with the other'. A kind and caring man in many ways which yes, was one of the big attractions to him in the first place as others have also noted.But when faced with me standing there with tears streaming down my cheeks. Told me to 'have a nice day'. In retrospect - I can see he knew he needed to say something 'nice' to make me feel better. So came up with a phrase that in his mind went with saying something nice. Totally inappropriate and yet funny in retrospect. But utterly unbelievable at the time it happened. Even when I said. I am standing here with tears streaming down my cheeks. Do you think I'm going to have a nice day? The confusion was very evident. It just didn't all go together for him. He'd been saying something he knew was 'nice'. Why didn't that work? Why did I have a problem with that?This book I read cover to cover in one sitting. It covers so many things about Aspergers and from a non-clinical but still very informative viewpoint. I understood my whole relationship with my ex from start to finish with this book. It all just fell into place. A truly amazing book that is told with love I feel. Thank you."},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"Like the book \\"Curious Incident\\", this text explores the nature of relationships with Asperger Syndrome \\"differently wired\\", people, as Jacobs describes them. In this book the relationship is real and the Authors own love affair with an erratic, loving, unfathomable and self destructive man.It is written with eloquence and enormmous emotion and combines clinical information with an engaging and difficult story. This book should be essential clinical/psychological/psychiatric training material but it is also so much more than a reference text for unintiated clinicians. It is also a beautifully written and difficult story and while Jacobs tells you frankly of her pain it seems her ultimate task is to understand the lover who nearly destroyed her and himself and to raise our understanding of these castigated and misunderstood people. Excellent."},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"This book is what I like to call an \\"awakening\\" book. Once in therapy a long time ago, and before I knew much about 12 step programs and AA, my therapist told me to read a little book called Adult Children of Alcoholics. My mother never drank. No one in our near or even distant family had alcoholism problems. I thought she was crazy. But I agreed to read it because it was a lean book, and a quick read. It was life changing for me. I saw my mother in every page, and I saw myself. This book had the same effect for me. I have been going crazy for about 6 years now with this man. I know I need to divorce him, but financially it is not prudent right now, so I've tried everything I can to try to diagnose what the heck is going on so we can live together. I've (we've) been to 8 therapists, both by ourselves, and together. Not one......let me repeat....Not One...ever clued in to Aspbergers (or anything else for that matter). It was years of futility going to therapy with him. Finally, I just lived with the fact that he probably has Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder, and the therapists just wont treat it because it's no longer on their DSM 1V list so they can't use it as a diagnosis. Best I could do was keep Scott Wetzlers book on PA men in my top nightstand drawer like a Bible and refer to it regularly for the preservation of my sanity and self esteem. I have been living with a man for several years who is tearing me apart. He is passive and calm, a professional who is in the sciences and medicine, book smart and professorial, liked by others, and packed with a complete PR manual of great references and Spin from others. (which is why I married him). He has absolutely not an ounce of common sense, presence of mind, empathy, compassion and insight. He is austerely lacking in the ability to be emotionally or even physically available. He has little to no self correct mechanism. He makes the same mistakes over and over. He hugs, he kisses, wants to hold hands, wants to be lovey dovey, he likes sex.....and says he wants love and intimacy. So why would I ever suspect he has Asbergers syndrome? Well, of course it would never enter my mind. He is a crazy maker extraordinaire, passive aggressive, and does things that are absolutely cruel and considered to be \\"disastrous\\" relationship moves, while he sabotages trust and the relationship. When told about it he argues and denies that he does anything. He lies, exxagerates, is hyperbolic, makes mountains out of molehills, but can't understand his partner's emotions.....at all !! Just cannot relate to women....period. And yet he was married for 25 years and has 2 children with someone. Hard to believe. He also convinced her she was Bipolar...and she's been on heavy meds since.....I wonder if she was just a victim with a high estrogen level and went bats from him. He's very convincing with that calm and rational approach, blaming everyone else for being \\"unstable\\" when all the time he is the erratic, irresponsible, and unreliable one. A day late, a dollar short, and a block away....not to mention the dullest tool in the shed....dense ! He repeats the same things, and does them again, and again, and again, even when they cause him pain, me pain, and they provoke horrible arguments. He has inflated provocative language, overexxagerates, gets dramatic and theatrical, and then accuses me of having a \\"character flaw\\" when I finally blow up. This book will help you identify and help you stop being 'Gaslighted\\" by someone who has severe hidden developmental problems. It will give you back your sanity, self esteem, and hopefully, it will help you formulate a plan to get out.....if you are one of the unfortunate of us women who are with one of these Mr. Spock's who are manipulative, self righteous, unevolved, rehearsed, and unable to ever give you what you really want....connection and understanding. This last therapist got close to a diagnosis.....but she just called him \\"damaged.\\" She said I needed to have compassion if I was ever going to be able to live with him, and that I had to treat him almost as if he was \\"retarded.\\" Well, if you are not a woman who wants to do this much work for such little return..........then get this book, and get a plan to escape. And I hope you therapists out there are reading this. Shame on you for not spotting this..... how can you be paid for being a professional with years of schooling behind you, and not have an acute BS meter, and miss this??? I wish I had all that money back....I need the nice vacation it would have afforded me.............and I deserve it !!"},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"This fantastic very informative read was well written and referenced.

I didn't realize the first one had Asperger but he is alot like the man in the book--the negative traits anyway. He doesn't seem typical Asperger to me, though. The other --my husband--is I think more typical Asperger and doesn't have the extreme negative traits as the one in the book relationship--altered sleep/time schedules, sleeping around, alchoholic. The Aspergers i work with are teens and children and most prefer to adhere to rules rather than break them. But the book did open my eyes regarding the &#34;other&#34; Asperger personality--infuriating and doen'st &#34;get it&#34; but doens't seem to have overt neurological symptoms. I always thought of it as narcissistic personality and maybe it is.But I would say most Aspergers don't seem narcissistic, rather they lack confidence. Then they compensate in socially akward ways.I liked the discussions towards the end of the book of other spouses with Aspergers and also the check lists. I would say those two things make the book worthwhile.However, I think the book really makes an NT feel that a relationship with an Aspie just wouldn't work at all. Since there are levels of Asperger tendencies, it's too bad that the man in this book was extreme in the negative aspects."},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"I really have enjoyed reading this book as I feel as if Jacobs is sitting down with me and telling me her story. It is informative and it gives the reader an excellent overview of what it is like to be in a relationship with someone who has Aspergers. I think that anyone who is dating or is married to someone with Autism/Aspergers should read this book. It helps to know that you are not alone and gives you tips on how you can handle situations when they arise. I also appreciate Jacobs links to websites of the people she refers to in her book."},{"Title":"Loving Mr. Spock: Understanding a Lover with Asperger's Syndrome","review":"I found the book to be interesting, as an account of another person's relationship, but the relationship did not convince me as being Asperger's. The author admitted she only guessed her former partner had Asperger's. My relationship is completely different in many ways, so I could not relate to her very much. Perhaps there is wide variance in Asperger's; perhaps he was not an Aspie at all.If you are interested in reading about other people's relationships, this is interesting and might as well be fiction. If you want to really connect and learn about Asperger's syndrome I DO NOT reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Diet Watchers Guide,","review":"I'm glad you read my book and I hope you understand that you are what you eat, and that if you eat properly you will grow to be a beautiful, healthy woman.

Diet Watchers tells the overweight person that they are fooling themselves over their weight problems. In other words the author of the book puts some blame on the dieter for being obese. This book encourages the dieter to take charge of their food intake. The dieter is told to look at themselves as they truly are, fat and unhappy about it.This diet focuses on filling up on vegetables, lean meats, and some fruits. The diet shuns junk, some sugary fruits, and sweets. What I really liked was Ann Gold's tips on having malteds (special recipes), and an emergency stash of food to carry around in case hunger strike.Ann Gold includes a picture of herself of a before and after. It was very impressive. She was corpulent, and unhappy looking in her before. In the after she was in a beautiful gown with a big smile on her face as slender as she could be.I would give this book a 3 star. It was published in the late 60's; so you can expect the attitude to be different from the feely good pop psychology of today.I wonder what happened to Diet Watchers group, and Ann Gold.

A number of the illustrations continue out into the margin-to the point where one was nearly printed off the page. In my copy several of the pages have been printed with either too much or too little ink. The whole production shows many signs of being thrown together-\\"slap-dash\\" is one word which comes to mind.Okay, so this is all cosmetic, but if the author and publisher cared so little about these things, how much care was taken (or rather, wasn't taken) over the text? I can't prove there are any major mistakes (after all, the book's audience is beginning woodworkers, of which I'm one). Woodworking can be a dangerous activity, and I need to feel I can trust the author. I don't feel that about this book."},{"Title":"Deathmasques (Judge Dredd)","review":"This is one of the better Dredd novels. The writing is very clean, concise, and free of confusing jargon and technobabble for the most part, and the author maintains a consistent tone throughout the novel.The author uses Armitage, one of the novels main characters, as a solid foil for Dredd, allowing the author to reveal more about Dredd and to touch upon areas the previous novel hadn't explored. With this novel, Judge Dredd evolves into something closer to a real human being than he'd been in The Savage Amusement.In a nutshell, if you enjoyed The Savage Amusement, you'll probably really like Deathmasques. If you haven't read the previous novel, then I suggest you think very carefully about what your limit for gratuitous violence is before reading Deathmasques, because this novel is one long blood-bath."},{"Title":"Deathmasques (Judge Dredd)","review":"the book has good pacing and the characters are wellwritten and true to their comic book selves. some readers may be turned off by the extreme violence but, if you're against violence judge dredd is not for you. the villian is particularly gruesome and nasty and more than a little scary. the book for the most part is a monster hunt (more of an entity than a monster) and straight forward in plot but, at the same time is a well written straight forward."},{"Title":"The Sales Manager's MENTOR","review":"Jeff Lehman's second edition and easy-to-read book opens with a wonderful piece of sage advice: \\"Your manager is either your mentor or tormentor.

This is adequate for those who are learning to speak Chinese and want to gain fluency in everyday speaking and grammar use, but I did find it frustrating that I had to look elsewhere for the characters. Additionally, I do feel that it would be easier to learn some vocabulary with the Chinese characters - for example the word for flowers, huar, is given, and the word for garden, huaryuan. Are they related? Is it the same root word? Without the character, there is no way to know.That criticism aside, I do feel that Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day has been very helpful in learning to speak Chinese. It provides a great deal of everyday vocabulary from around the town and house, and presents it in a fun format. It comes complete with stickers to label everyday objects in your house, for example, which act as a constant reminder as to the Chinese words.I definately recommend this book, with the addition of a good dictionary for the student interested in learning Chinese characters."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"I have to start this review saying that i thought more than 4 times before buy this book.For me the title was not to atractive (not too serious for a formal chinese student). But i have to say that since i received this book (with other three books to learn chinese), it got my atention.This book has colorfull pages, beautiful illustrations, lot of useful vocabulary, and an interested way to introduce new chinese word in every text, even in english text.Teachs you from you own language, make reference between english grammar and chinese grammar.This book it's not ambitious, doesnt include chinese caracthers, it's focus on speak, and not to read.With this book you will learn (at least) to say in chinese:Where is the table? (nar you ....)This is the chicken (zhe shi yi ge ji).I want tea, (wo yao cha).1,2,3,4,5... 1359...(yi, er, san, si, etc)Red, blue, gray (hongse, lanse, etc)...This is, that is (zhe shi, na shi).Today is monday, see you tomorrow (jintian shi xingqi yi, mingtian jian).Also include stickers with objects in chinese to stick to your table, clock, window, sofa, cat, etc,At the end you will have a small vocabulary, but believe me, the way will be really funny.The only lack of this book it's that doesn't include a CD, it's really important to listen the pronunciation, especially if it's purpose of the book.It's a good tool for beginners, and if you want to start by yourself (and that's a lot if we talk about chinese).Sincerely,from the South of the World (Chile)CarolinaPD: Sorry for my english... i just speak spanish and a little bit of chinese"},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"I found a few translation mistakes, but most are corrected later on by giving the other correct definition (though you may want a dictionary to be sure which is which). There weren't too many though, and I'm sure most any foreign language book is bound to have a few. What I really loved about this book was that in addition to the pinyin, they also gave the pronunciation piece by piece the way it would really be written in English-it's the only book I've seen that's done that, and for that added help on the pronuciation (which you could very easily mess up using only the pinyin) I would recommend this book.But it's not only that: it offers most of the vocab you would NEED while in China, and though it doesn't have much to offer in the way of grammar, you can get by with only a little bit of confusion with the words and limited gramatical structure you pick up in the book.And just in case it doesn't mention it in the description: this is Mandarin Chinese: which is spoken in Beijing, and not the Cantonese which is spoken in Hong Kong."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"Before buying (or reviewing) a language instruction book, you should consider the purpose of the book. This book intends to give you some basic speaking ability in Chinese in a relatively short amount of time, to help you express yourself while traveling, shopping, eating, and doing other typical tourist activities. It does an excellent job of that. If you're looking for more than that, choose a book that better meets your needs.The book is divided into 24 lessons, with the suggestion you study each one for 10 minutes. That's just 4 hours of study, plus however much time you want to spend practicing. This won't make you fluent, won't teach you to read/write characters, and it won't really help you understand someone speaking Chinese to you, but it will give you the basic speaking skills it aims to provide.There are flash cards to cut out and practice with, and sticky labels to put on things around your house. The words are written in Pinyin, which is a romanization of Mandarin words based on their pronunciation. Pinyin pronunciation isn't obvious to English readers, so the book includes additional phonetic spelling. For example, it tells you the PinYin word 'jie' is pronounced 'jee-eh'.There are a number of exercises so you can practice what you've learned, which helps you remember.If you'd like to build a good foundation of common Chinese words and phrases with a minimal amount of study time, then I think you'll be happy with this book."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"This book is basically a glorified list of vocabulary words. There are no conversations and very few sentences in the book. It doesn't teach much grammar, and seems to encourage using Chinese words with English sentence structures. If this were my only text, it would be very bad, but I'm finding it useful as a suplemetal text. The labels, pictures, and flash cards are all useful, but only when used in conjunction with a course or other book that actually teaches the language, not just the words."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"not enough said about this book, it takes you from basics to conversation."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"I teach from this book.

Pronunciation in Chinese is very essential to the word and understanding of the language."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"My boyfriend and I are going to be moving to China next year, and since he knows absolutely no Chinese I thought this book would be helpful.

There are lots of pictures, pages to help you practice saying and writing the words, etc. The idea of doing just a little bit each day is a good one. Unfortunately, there is no audio tape. Audio is always so important for pronounciation, but this is even more true with Chinese where tones are critical to the word's meaning. I would not recommend this book for that reason."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"For the traveller this is a great, fairly easy way to learn a difficult language."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read"},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"This book explains things well, and I like that it comes with stickers to use around the house to label things in Chinese. The reason I gave it 3 stars is it does not have any Chinese characters during the main lessons, only pinyin, except for an infrequent focus on one character. Learning written Mandarin can be intimidating to a beginning learner, but even if you rely mainly on pinyin, I think it still helps to see the characters and get used to them being there."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"The Kershul method of learning is a great way to learn a new language.

Correct pronunciation of basic sounds is critical to a non-native speaker before jumping too far into the language. Still, I'm a visual hands-on learner and I appreciate the visual association of words with objects as opposed to systems that employ only spoken lessons. What works best for me is a combination of the two. Consequently, an accompanying tape or CD would enhance this book greatly."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"Good book for learning but was pretty used.Not good since some of the lesson require towrite answers out. You can not do that when they arealready there. No problem with shipping though."},{"Title":"Chinese in 10 Minutes a Day","review":"The title really speaks for itself. I was desperate to learn Chinese quickly for travel, was up late, read the reviews, flipped out and bought it. Another romance language if you know one in 10 minutes a day maybe, Chinese if you speak English from a book without audio-not so much....Let's review the logistics. They don't read English so you can't point to it. You don't read Chinese so you're looking at pictures (not when driving to work). So after dinner you paste romanized Chinese words around the house. Time's up. The next day you memorize a few words that may have a different meaning from the one you intend because you don't have audio phonetics and its a tonal language. Gotta go. The next day, you forget evrything because you only spent 10 minutes and you can't relate it to English. You do the math.The approach reminds me of the Monty Python skit, where Hungarian tries to buy cigarettes using a phrasebook that inspires him to say \\"my hovercraft is full of eels\\" .And as to the reviews, we don't laugh at Clark Griswold for saying \\"look at how greatful the French are when we make the slightest effort to speak the language....\\" because other countries are more grateful when we try to butcher their language. We laugh because he buys \\"French on the airplane\\" and believes it works. On the way to China, you're tired, you drink, its crowded, you don't read Chinese, unlike French, they can't read this book, you take out \\"Chinese in 10 minutes a day\\" on a 17 hour flight, oops that's my day. Exaggeration, but not by much.You would either have to grow old or land in Hong Kong!"},{"Title":"Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests","review":"Kaegi broke the habitual insights into the early breakdown of the Byzantine Empire that usually &quot;blame&quot; external factors such as Armenian disertion, Christian Arabs flight from the battlefield, or even natural catastrophy. The book points out that the Muslims have done everything to secure victory, they even played down the political traps neatly set by the Greeks. Also, the Byzantines' weaknesses and strategic flaws were thoroughly explained without the usual &quot;blame-it-on-someone/something&quot; basis.A much clearer picture of what went on in the frontline (or rather front cities) and temporary Byzantine's headquarter at Antioch was presented excellently. Along with what the Muslims' Generals carefully thought about their disintegrating, once formidable, foe. A must for anyone interested on the field, a necessity for any researcher looking for a fresh approach on the subject"},{"Title":"Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests","review":"I actually really enjoyed this book. It did a great job shedding light on why Byzantium caved so quickly to the initial Islamic conquest in the 7th century. It also did a nice job dispelling some of the more commonly cited (but insufficiently supported) explainations -- especially in regards to the religious differences between the Church Hiearchy and the population of Syria and the surrounding areas which therefore explained why the Muslim Arabs seems to be able to take over so easily. Kaegi instead gives a well reasoned and researched description of the exhausted state of the area after the delibatiting Persian war and the lack of manpower available to Heraclius as a result of years of plague and war. All that said, this book is one of the more poorly edited books I have read in a while (e.g., multiple cases of sloppy repetition). It actually causes a distraction in reading the book. Bear that in mind if you want to read this. While less specifically addressing the conquests, if you want a higher level and more readiable book, get \\"Justinian's Flea\\" instead."},{"Title":"Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests","review":"First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 19 February 2012This is an excellent, well-researched book describing and analyzing the early islamic conquests and the reasons why the Eastern Roman Empire failed to prevent them. This book has many qualities.First, it makes extensive use of Armenian and other eastern christian sources to explain the failure of the Byzantine Empire in resisting the Arab Conquests, in addition to Muslim and Byzantine sources. This allows the author to focus his analysis and uncover the material reasons for the Empire's defeats, as opposed to the religious ex post explanations that are all to frequent in Byzantine or Muslim accounts. It also has the added advantages of showing that the Conquests were not inevitable and that the Empire did notsuddenly collapse. Rather, the ageing and ailing Emperor Heraclius, followed by his successors, tried multiple strategies, punctuated by truces, to stem the Arab onslaught. The last of these, which involved retreating behind the Taurus, creating a no-man's land on either side of a defensible frontier and reorganizing the provinces by putting them under military control and on a military footing, evolved into the themes. It allowed the Empire to survive the at least yearly raids that were a characteristic of the second half of the 7th century.Second, a major contribution of this book is to review and analyze the state of the Empire (and of its emperor) and the Empire's strategic thinking in 630 (to the extent that it had one, as Kaegi seems to believe), just before the Arab attacks begun. The description of the Empire's weaknesses, in particular in military and financial terms, and as it emerged \\"victorious\\" of the long war against the Sassanids are particularly interesting. Just as interesting is the analysis of the timing of the Arab assaults. Byzantine forces were caught just as they were re-deploying and re-occupying territories which they had lost to the Sassanids some 15 years before.Third, the analysis of the various engagements, and of the catastrophic Byzantine defeat of Yarmouk in 636 in particular, is also excellent. It shows that, despite superiority in numbers, the Byzantine forces' were heteregenous and their morale was low. They were facing more mobile ennemies and operating in provinces that were largely foreign to them (which the exception, of course, of the Christian or pro-byzantine Arab troops). The local populations therefore had little reason to trust, and sometimes even to welcome, at least some of the Byzantine troops with their heavy-handed behaviors and the imperial tax machine that came with it.Fourth, this book describes and explains in detail the various campaigns and strategies that developed on both sides. While doing this, it clearly shows how the Emperor underestimated the ennemy, and then miscalculated, leading to the disaster of Yarmouk. It also shows that the Empire, even after the defeat, was far from done, with the Emperor learning the lessons and devising new strategies to hold on to northern Syria and Mesopotamia, which also failed. His successors would be 5a bit) more successful in defending Armenia.It has, however, at least three setbacks to it, and this is why I rate it four stars, rather than five. One is form. Walter Kaegi's writting skills are unfortunatly not as good as his scholarship, with the text containing numerous summaries and repetitions that can be tiresome, do not add anything and can even distract the reader from time to time from what is a fascinating story.My second issue is a consequence of form. The author, in addition to repetitions, sometimes makes statements without explaining in detail the elements that underpin them. Nore that this does not mean that the statements are unjustified. They are mostly well grounded and shrewd. However, the grounding is not presented in detail, a bit as if the author was addressing this book to his students whom he would already expect to have a significant amont of knowledge on Byzantium in the 7th century. This, of course, makes the book that much harder to read (although not impossible) for a general reader with little background on the period. At times, I even felt that the author was more interested in presenting his conclusions, their main ramifications and how he got to them.My third issue is that this book concentrates on the loss of Palestine, Phenicia, Syria and Mesopotamia. It also mentions the subsequent loss, after Heraclius' death, of most of Armenia, but this time only after bitter struggles, but it has virtually NOTHING to say about the loss of Egypt. Since this was the richest of all of the Empire's provinces, this is most surprising.All in all, a great read for all those interested in the period and in Byzantium, but it is preferable to already have a good understanding of the historical background before \\"diving\\" into this book."},{"Title":"Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests","review":"Walter Kaegi's 'Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests' is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the details behind the rapid Byzantine collapse in Syria and Mesopotamia. However, those who want a more general and broader historical survey of the period in general should look elsewhere, as this book's focus is narrow and its audience primarily scholarly. For example, the Muslim conquest of Egypt is only ever mentioned in passing: the book's focus is purely that of Syria, Armenia, and Mesopotamia. Kaegi wisely takes a more military approach to the problem than traditional scholarship has applied, and he manages to argue quite convincingly that the religious dissent between Nestorian and Monophysite churches in the east and Constantinople, the theory that is still lazily applied, played virtually no role in the Muslim success. Instead, he cites the strategic difficulty in defending Syria, the surprise and shock of the Byzantines that led to a defeatist attitude, the lack of weapons amongst the Roman population in Syria, and the complicated politics of the last Romano-Persian war. This book focuses on a chronologically tiny amount of time by the standards of ancient and medieval history. As only a few years are discussed, Kaegi is able to go into great detail and thus is able to argue his thesis convincingly for all of the geographic regions he surveys. Kaegi also needs to be commended for his use of Armenian and Arabic source material. He begins the book by noting the limitation of the Greek and Latin sources (although he does not ignore the difficulties in using Arabic, Syriac, and Armenian material and some of the requisite historiographical problems) and he wisely does not assume that the Byzantine sources are in anyway better than the others. Theophanes is accorded the rather low place he deserves. The Battle of Yarmouk also receives a lengthy and solid treatment, far better than David Nicolle's Osprey book, although the description in Haldon'sThe Byzantine Warsis still probably the best narrative of the battle.As other reviewers have noted, Kaegi's writing is frequently broken into small blocks of abrupt and awkward sentences. He repeats himself often, and sometimes arguments that are semi-relevant remain in the text when they would better belong in the footnotes. However, the writing style is still significantly better than hisHeraclius, Emperor of Byzantium(an essential companion to this volume) so I'm not going to be too hard on him for that. This book is too important for the study of the early Muslim clashes with Byzantium to be exceptionally harsh based on Kaegi's writing style. This is not a general history of the period, but rather a detailed study of the immediate causes of Byzantine collapse in Syria and Mesopotamia, and one that will remain invaluable for a long time."},{"Title":"Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests","review":"Kaegi's book is a landmark study of one of the most important events in the history of the Byzantine Empire. His use of both Arab and Byzantine sources and his insistence on military factors are crucial for treating this subject properly.However, this book is almost unreadable. In several instances Kaegi repeats himself within a chapter, covering the same subject that he has already discussed as if one were reading a draft in progress. He also uses many infelicitious if not nonsensical phrases such as \\"victorious defeat\\" (p. 259). His brief, choppy sentences are frequently banal."},{"Title":"Like A Sister: A Novel","review":"This has to be the most boring novel I've read in years.

In Like a Sister, Janice Daugharty has grippingly captured the small town rural life of a 13-year old girl known as Sister. But Sister is not merely a sister, she must also be a surrogate mother to her younger siblings because their mother is too immersed in her own sorry life to care for them. Sister, despite poverty and lack of adult supervision, strives to better herself and to &quot;be good.&quot; Sister is endearing and attracts the too-familiar attentions of an opportunistic older man. Her small town world then becomes a minefield with constant dangers to herself, her good-for-nothing mother, her younger twin brothers and baby sister, and eventually even her wonderful neighbor. Ms. Daugharty's characters take shape so clearly that one can easily understand their complexities.

However, the viseral one-two emotional punch of the first chapter--only five pages--made me put the book down and reassess the caliber of the story I was reading here. I think it a great read.Sister's world is ugly. Daughtery uses deadly accurate prose to depict the starkness of Sister's life. Daugharty is also particularly convincing at portraying the confusion and pain of a thirteen-year-old trying to negotiate life with little information and no parental support. But in all the ugliness, there are, for Sister, threads of gold-the physical pleasure of holding her baby sister, Lil; the resigned kindness of the Judge who has the power to take Lil away, and does; the compassion of Willa, her neighbor, who becomes Sister's redeemer. And so Daugharty weaves these threads, makes a net for Sister, and the net is hope. How the heck does Daugharty get THERE?

Sister, a young teenager and barely a teenager at that, being thirteen, left with twin brothers and a baby to take care of for the summer, had these siblings dumped on her by her mother and her mother's boyfriend. Everywhere she went, Sister had Baby Lill on her hip. When she turned fourteen, Sister didn't even want to tell anyone on September 10 that it was her birthday. No one remembered, anyway. My own daughter's birthday, September 10, and I had to stop and think about the birthday cakes, presents, cards, family and friends who made it special at that age. But Sister's mother, Marnie, and Marnie's boyfriend, Sade, were too busy running their cafe in Cornerville, GA to remember Sister's birthday or even the girl herself. Too busy prostituting and fighting most of the time while the twin boys ran wild and people whispered that the baby was really Sister's.\\"Like a Sister\\" is a story of living poor and alone in southern Georgia. There is never food in Sister's house and the best she can do is to take the baby to a nearby store and play on the sympathy of the store owner who lets her have a few candy bars and later on, some baby food. The boys and Sister scrounge up what they can, and it's usually a candy bar and sometimes Spaghetti-os. They can't depend on their mother at all, but Sister still loves her mother and wants her mom to be home with her. She misses all that a mother should be to her.It's a fortunate thing for Sister that a neighbor named Willa notices the conditions that they live in and recognizes that the mother worries only about herself. Sister becomes a friend and she visits Willa who has daughters around the same age. There are home-cooked meals and what appears to be a real family who sits on the porch after dinner, and the girls have pretty dresses that their mother sews for them. It is 1956 and Willa is the perfect homemaker who cares for her family and home. Sister notices that there are always good smells coming from Willa's kitchen, and during school Willa babysits little Lill. Marnie is two months behind paying Willa for babysitting.Sister goes to church on Sundays with her brothers and the baby in tow. She realizes that she can \\"rise above\\" the way she appears and the way she is living by going to Sunday School and church and trying to better herself and her brothers. She enjoys church until a new bigshot in town makes her take the fussy baby out of church and then wants to have a word with her. He has noticed Sister's attractiveness and Sister's life is about to change.\\"Like a Sister\\" is a heartbreaking story of a mother who has lost her way, and of her daughter who has some pride in herself and the determination to try to do the best she can at such a young age to raise her brothers and baby sister on her own. There are twists and turns in this book that made it a page-turner for me. This is another of Janice Daugharty's books that will stay with me for a long time to come. Sister is a very endearing and lovable young girl, and she is not easy to forget.I highly recommend this to readers who enjoy Southern literature and literary fiction and to readers in general."},{"Title":"Like A Sister: A Novel","review":"Don't start this novel unless you are willing to give up hours and hours..

For heaven's sake, the neighbors' dog even - well, if I say any more, I'll give it away. I did think the title character was one of the most lovably realistic fictional teens I've ever come across, and I was rooting for her the whole way through. I just wish the author hadn't spoiled things for her with such a ridiculous plot twist."},{"Title":"Like A Sister: A Novel","review":"As with other novels by this author, you feel that she is recycling old plots and characters by Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and others. She has a feel for the landscape but while there is some good writing here and there, the plot is thin."},{"Title":"Kaal","review":"A quite resentful review:I just hope KAAL's co-producer, Shah Rukh Khan, gets back the money he invested into this. KAAL, being a confused tale of predatory beasts and restless spirits, is not a good movie. It was released (or maybe paroled) in 2005 and, with a big name cast and distributed under the banner of the usually more reliable Dharma Productions, you'd assume it's got a good chance to be decent. But something went horribly wrong. And the blame most probably lies at the feet of first time director, Soham Shah, who also is responsible, but more like irresponsible, for the story and the screenplay.The plot: Wildlife expert Krish Thapar (John Abraham) and his wife and photographer Riya (Esha Deol) are assigned by National Geographic to India's Orbit National Park to investigate the killings perpetrated by man-eating tigers in the past two months. Meanwhile, spoiled brat Dev (Vivek Oberoi), his superstitious girlfriend Ishika (Lara Dutta), and their two friends are out on a weekend getaway when their car inhales a black cat and breaks down. They hitch a ride with an unsavory character who then lures them to the Orbit National Park on the promise of excellent game hunting.There, Dev and company soon bump into Krish and Riya, and the two parties form into one. Evidently, there are rules which you must heed in the Orbit National Park. Never go on foot. Never carry firearms. Stay off the core area. Don't drink from the well. Sensible rules, all of them, which then, of course, are summarily violated. Shortly after, people begin to vanish and/or die. Later, the group is saved from a tiger mauling by a mysterious, stick carrying stranger calling himself Kali Pratap Singh (Ajay Devgan). Kali later is hired as their guide when, in the aftermath of a terrible storm, the group becomes trapped in the tiger infested forest reserves. As they continue on their hazardous trek and as gruesome casualties continue to mount, it dawns on the shaken survivors that in the vast, dark expanse of the jungle might lurk an entity far more malevolent than mere man-eating tigers.There are so many things off about KAAL that it's easier to first mention the very few things that are right. First, Ajay Devgan, with his hooded eyes and trademark intensity, is ideal for the role of the dubious Kali. He's solid here and menacing, at times. In fact, even a bit more intensity would've been warranted for the role. But, as it is, Devgan delivers a performance tinged with an ominous undercurrent which reduces the audience to an uncertain state. The only other things I remotely liked about KAAL are the musical numbers. The two songs in the film are wisely inserted at the very beginning (\\"Kaal Dhamaal,\\" an item number featuring Shah Rukh Khan and the hot girl from MTV India) and in the closing credits (\\"Tauba Tauba\\"). There's also a bonus song \\"Nassa Nassa\\" which can be accessed in the Special Features section. There. So much for the positives.KAAL is straight out drivel. The pacing is molasses; the set-up scenes just took forever long, and the payoffs are minimal. At 2 hours and 6 minutes, KAAL could've really benefited from having 30 to 40 minutes lopped off. As per the Bollywood custom of stealing crumbs from the tables of various movies, KAAL shows off scattershot bits pilfered from THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, PREDATOR, THE SIXTH SENSE, and FINAL DESTINATION. And I'm sure there are other films, of which titles I can't recall. The third most vexing thing about this film is that it starts off as an adventure thriller and then segues into the horror genre, and does it so awkwardly. The second most vexing thing is the woeful acting across-the-board. The worst thing is, of course, the amateurish and laughable attempts to elicit screams of fright from the viewing audience. Please! Whatever sense of dread and foreboding that initially exists is irrevocably undermined with the movie's gung-ho indulgence in overfamiliar camera tricks and silly scare tactics. Get this: From the edge of the movie screen, a hand stealthily reaches out towards an unsuspecting character, only to have that very hand turn out to belong to that same character. I laughed my cheeks off with that one. And, by the way, here's a tip on surviving in a horror/slasher film: when given a ride by a creepy dude who keeps hailing the Lord of Death under his breath, it might be healthier to not take him up on any of his suggested alternate routes or destinations. Come to think of it, I don't know that I'd even get on a damn vehicle with a creepy driver. I'm just sayin'.Other no-nos in this skunker:1) Even though John Abraham's wildlife expert character is familiar with many animal species, I get the feeling he'd like nothing better to do all day than loll around in the grass in the embrace of a limp and disinterested (and possibly fake?) python. Even if, as soon as he gets a ring on his cell, he absent-mindedly drops the snake.2) It's always pretty pathetic to see a mighty hunter with a firearm go one on one against a rabbit.3) When your jeep gets a wheel stuck in a deep pothole, why not have everyone get off and help, instead of only two men pushing whilst the other four stay in the vehicle?4) When Dev ominously says that \\"smoking kills\\" and looks really intense while saying it, one would expect some kind of payoff (there isn't). By the way, the wildlife expert should've known better than to smoke in the national park.6) In the first half of the film, the focus is completely on the tigers (to the point where several scenes are shot from the beasts' point of view; apparently, tigers are well equipped with infra-red goggles), but then they're all but discarded in the second half as the focus shifts unequivocally to the horror aspects.Did I say the acting sucks? Vivek Oberoi's performances are always touch and go, always bordering on ham. You just never know when he'll decide a pouty expression is merited. He's actually more okay than not in this one, but his character simply lacks texture and depth, as do all the characters here, actually. John Abraham is guilty not only of overflaunting his abs but of being ineffective, although, granted, his character isn't given much to do. He doesn't even dispense that much wildlife wisdom. The beautiful and nicely limbed Lara Dutta doesn't serve her film career at all with her B-movie acting here. She resorts to being caught in screaming fits and to incessantly mentioning how things are \\"very inauspicious.\\" Of course, when the inauspicious stuff actually begins to happen, she stops saying it and just clings to the screaming. But, then, just to show her range, she implements the crying. Meanwhile, Esha Deol, mistress of the blank-faced stare, makes up for her lack of acting talents by working out a lot. Her body's hot. As I've said, only Ajay Devgan is decent here, but I'm sure even he wouldn't list this role as one of his better ones.This dvd offers the compulsory \\"Making of\\" featurette which runs at almost 22 minutes and is predominantly in English. That way, you can hear the cast go on and on about how cool of a movie this is and how much fun they had in the filming of it. Suckers, all. I was willing to give two stars for this one because Dutta and Deol are smoking hot. But I'm taking away one star for the film having so many flaws it took me forever to compile them and then write this review. I dunno, I guess I'm a sucker, too."},{"Title":"Kaal","review":"The previous reviewer has done an excellent job of reviewing this movie, so I'll keep it brief - this is not worth a purchase or even a rental. The acting by the leads such as John Abraham, Vivek Oberoi, Esha Deol, and Lara Dutta are overly exaggerated and not at all credible. The only actor worth mentioning is Ajay Devgan who portrays a mysterious stranger who hints at what is truly skulking around in the wildlife park which forms the setting for this movie.John Abraham as usual tries to coast by, not on talent, but on his abs and super-fit physique. His portrayal of a so-called wildlife expert is cringe-inducing, especially in one scene where he chases a python and manhandles it, then calmly shrugs it off as he takes a call! Esha Deol and Lara Dutta are nothing more than eye candy, and Vivek Oberoi too is wasted in this movie. Though Ajay Devgan plays his role with some measure of credibility, I wonder what possessed him to take on a role in this below average scare fest.By now, after watching other trite Bollywood horror, such asKrishna Cottage,Darna Mana Hai,Darna Zaroori Hai, etc. I should have learned my lesson, but I think I'll give Raaz a try before calling it quits. Btw, \\"Bhoot\\" is actually quite a decent offering in the Bollywood horror genre."},{"Title":"An Illustrated History Of Horror And Science-fiction Films","review":"Like another reviewer, I first read the '67 edition of Clarens' book when I was in high school. Already a horror movie fan, I needed context and appreciation of the genre, and that's exactly what this wonderful book provided, then and now. This is a book for the serious fan in search of a history of both the technique and ideas behind horror films. Clarens' observations about specific films' production, actors' performances, and even camera tricks will stay with you and help you to enjoy horror movies, old and new, even more than you did before. It is illustrated well, but it's an illustrated history, not an annotated photo catalog. Thus this is a book with terrific words and ideas, plus images--it's not intended to be a glossy fan mag with captions. Approach it with an expectation of ideas plus a few images, and let your imagination work its magic. Read the book to understand the big picture--not just to savor a few illustrations. I'm thrilled with the re-issue, and expect the book to support intelligent fans as well as cinema scholars.

It was the book's title that first caught my attention. And, I was not disappointed. The author covers the subject of alternate financing in detail; IPOs, angel investors, venture capital, overseas financing and incubators. Often, banks are unwilling and/or incapable of understanding the unique requirements of a budding entrpreneur's financial needs; for example, in the software industry, most entrepreneurs can only offer intellectual property as collateral; this does not fit well with a bank's traditional mode of collateral (&quot;If I cannot see it or touch it, it does not exist&quot;). In this regard, the author offers well-defined chapters on helping borrowers prepare well for the reality (chapters 7, 8 and 9 - Valuing Your Business, Presenting Financials and Preparing Business Plans, respectively). One note of discord - while it is impossible to research and include every single source of information, the author should have included some of the well-established and well-known sources, in the appendices. Glaring omissions in Appendix A include The IndUS Entrepreneurs, a leading VC Club in Silicon Valley; Appendix B should have included the well- established entrepreneurship programs at Stanford University and University of Washington. Finally, I am glad that the book's retail price is below $25 (and often available at a disount); this tremendously benefits entrepreneurs and those individuals researhcing alternate sources of funding, for their business ventures."},{"Title":"Where to Go When the Bank Says No : Alternatives For Financing Your Business","review":"If you are tired of hearing no as an entrepreneur, then you need this book.

This one for a Volvo 740 GLE, and another for a Mercedes 240D. Bought both used, and must say that niether was worth their corresponding 5 or 6 bucks.Use the brickboard instead. Their information is much more complete, and it's free.The front of this book says based on the teardown of a car. Well, not sure what they tore down but it sure as heck wasn't anything remotely resembling my Volvo.What is in this book talks mostly about the V6 models, rather than the B230 derivatives. ( Which probably makes up 90% of all the volvos supposedly covered )After initially attempting to use this book as a reference for changing my water pump, its pages are now reserved for sopping up spilled coolant. It is sufficiently inaccurate, that taking detailed notes and just 'winging it would have probably yielded better results.For example, no mention of removing the timing belt cover to get access to the last bolt on the water pump. No mention that if you happen to drop that nut, it goes straight into the lower shroud, and can not be retrieved without hours of additional work. -Yep- did it.The brickboard, does mention these things. So, the fact that a branded HowTo book doesn't is kind of telling as to what actually goes into creating their books. I can't emagine they used a Volvo certified mechanic, because he/she would have made sure these things were mentioned.Another example is changing the belts. Try detensioning the A/C unit and get the belts off the way they suggest. Notice anything missing?I am sincerely glad, that my local EMT's don't have their ambulances maintained with books from these people.I had a toyota and spent $75 on the factory manual. It was worth it. I eventually got the 123 body Mercedes factory guide on CD. It was exceptional.

I read somewhere that reading Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment faithfully re-creates Russian society of his era in the city from his own experiences. While this is no doubt true I found that the greatest appeal for me was the way the reader is taken on a psychological journey inside the mind of the main protagonist. Starting from the shock of the brutal murders he commits we are led through his vacillating self-justification, guilt, seeking love and redemption to the final resolution. I had forgotten how the novel ended exactly and so was kept interested to see how it would all turn out for Raskolnikov.

Nevertheless, in comparison to other &quot;classics,&quot; it lacks vitality, vitiated by the author's interminable and relentless prose concerning mostly the internal psychoses of a protagonist non-representative of humanity in general. Far better 18th-century novels redolent with evocative imagery and possessing greater thematic depth deserve attention; namely, the Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Melville immerses the reader into a philosophical epic; Dostoyevsky harasses the reader. Hawthorne envelopes the reader's senses in prose so sumptuous it borders on decadence; Dostoyevsky austerely moves along his plot. Wilde smirks sardonically at his hero; Dostoyevsky throws him in our face. To recapitulate, Fyodor has some excellent ideological intrigue within his work--though mostly only a reactive jerk against radical philosophies of his time. His flaw, I believe, lies in his inability to entice the reader into the story, keep him there, and finally send him on his merry way with the satisfaction of having undergone cleverly-wrought enlightenment. I warily entered the story, stayed due to my own inertia, and then finished on my apathetic way, having undergone stale enlightenment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is probably Dostoevsky's best novel. It is a murder story set in late 19th century St Petersburg, Russia.I just finished reading the book, and when I put it down I thought that it was one of the finest novels ever written. Many think it is long like Tolstoy's 1400 page \\"War and Peace,\\" but actually it is a quick read, and I read it in two evenings.The author accomplishes a lot with the novel. It is:- a compelling read, start to finish,- compact for the story, only 500 pages,- it has an excellent set of characters,- contains moral dilemmas,- has role reversals,- features universal themes,- contains excellent but not the world's best prose,- many resonances with the reader,- and it has good drama in spots.Overall, it is a very satisfying read.The Bloomsbury guide has a nice write up on C&P; and it suggests related reading. It did not rate it as a masterpiece: one of 40 books that it considers as masterpieces, selected from the top 375 fiction writers since 1800. There I disagree and think it must be among the best books of all time - based on literary merit.My suggestions for further or related reading would be:(1) Dostoevsky: Brothers Karamazov,(2) Tolstoy: War and Piece,(3) Kafka: The Castle, and(4) Gogol: Dead Souls.Interestingly, Bloomsbury Guide does not rate any of Dostoevsky's works as masterpieces, but it rates al of selections (2), (3), and (4) as masterpieces."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The novel is a very good one, and compared to the crap that passes as literature these days it is a classic, however, it is not a great piece of literature. The book has too many manifest flaws, such as being far too long, far too \`talky', and most of all, aside from the belief that it's a \`Christian tract', the biggest misread of the book is that it is somehow a work of \`social realism'. Nothing could be less true- it is primarily a work of symbolism. This is evident from its title, as the very punishment referred to is not that of the legal variety, but that of internal guilt. Yes, when it was first published, in pre-Freudian 1866, it may have seemed a work of psychological depth, but even compared to the fiction of Anton Chekhov, just a few decades later, it is utterly Neolithic in its approach to the human psyche....If Dostoevsky's novel can be considered great, by some, it is not because of the things he intended within it that manifest its greatness, but that which was unwitting, and beyond him at the time, such as the real key to understanding the work, its great insight, that people do not change at a fundamental level. I was recently watching the Up documentary film series, by Michael Apted, on DVD, and those films are premised on the very notion that Crime And Punishment is, the Jesuit saying of \`Give me the child till he is seven, and I shall give you the man.' We do not glimpse Raskolnikov at seven, but given what we know becomes of him it is not difficult to extrapolate that he was as amoral then as his twentysomething self appears in the book. If Dostoevsky intended this work to be an allegory on Christianity's redemptive power he clearly failed, so I posit that that was not his intent at all, and that the psychological and ethical stasis of most human beings was his major theme.Regardless, the book is not a great piece of art. It contains great moments, some brilliant writing, and is a very good work of art, however primitive, but it is certainly not great. A modern reader can simply not ignore all its manifest flaws, such as the awkward and heavy-handed symbolism, the stilted and unrealistic dialogue, which reinforces the truth of the characters' symbolism, as it veers between mawkishness during some of the death scenes and Raskolnikov's several confession scenes, and preachiness in many of the philosophical engagements.Another problem with the work, one not in the actual work, but in its willful misinterpretation by critics with axes to grind, is that, aside from the confusion over the literary value of the work, all the poor theories regarding psychology and the fundaments of criminality have somehow found their way into pop culture, and done much to lead people astray in their ideas of true good and evil. Yet, the many fundamental questions that Raskolnikov deals with are never directly addressed, and are only used as a flawed premise for the main action of the novel to go off on. Raskolnikov ponders why those who have power or mass murder in war are labeled heroes, gain fame and respect, have paeans and monuments made for them while the low born, who have to struggle with and against each other, are jailed if they kill. In Part Five, Chapter Four, he rationalizes not confessing to the murders by using this defense: \`What wrong have I done them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That's only a phantom....They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them. And what should I say to them- that I murdered her, but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?' he added with a bitter smile. \`Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting it. A coward and a fool! They wouldn't understand and they don't deserve to understand. Why should I go to them?' This is a philosophically legitimate point, yet, instead of plumbing this, and applying it to the social caste he exists within, Raskolnikov flies off into mere pop sociological dementia with his ideas on supermen and exceptionalism, never realizing that exceptionalism in one or two fields, no matter how exceeding, brilliant, nor gifted, does not imply any sort of reciprocal ethical exceptionalism.Yet, throughout the book, despite moments of brilliance, whenever Dostoevsky gets too close to the core, the nub of what the book is really about, he backs away. Whether because he lacked the answer or lacked the desire to deal with its clash with his own belief systems I do not know. But it is a flaw, and one that results in banal and bland sermonizing, such as that which ends the book in a very trite Hollywood film fashion:He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.But that is the beginning of a new story- the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.To end, Crime And Punishment is certainly a milestone work in the development of both Dostoevsky and the art of the novel, but a work's cultural or artistic import is not equivalent to its artistic excellence. Therefore, while it may be a great representation of its time, artistically and culturally, it is not a great book- neither as a social tract nor as a novel. It reads more like a mid-stage version of better models to come, which is exactly what it really is. The very fact that such gross misreadings of it has taken root is a testament to the laziness of most readers, and the unwillingness of most to think for themselves. It is this problem with readers, their own anomic stasis, writ into the larger society, that Dostoevsky actually deals with. Raskolnikov, however, still smiles."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This was the 2nd book by Dostoevsky that I've read, well, kind of. About a year ago I started reading The Idiot, but I found that pretty boring and didn't even finish it, but it was a very different case with Crime and Punishment. This book tells the story of a man named Raskolinov who decides to kill an old pawnbroker, justifying his actions by reasoning that the death of this miserable old woman will be better for society. Anyway, it's pretty interesting seeing how the main character behaves throughout the book. Besides the main character, there is an interesting supporting cast such as his friend, his mother and sister, and a family he helps which includes a prostitute he befriends. There are subplots concerning these characters which are interesting and in other novels these subplots would maybe be distracting and bog the novel down, but I think they're pretty interesting in Crime and Punishment and if it weren't for them, the book would be a lot shorter. Also, Dostoevsky does a good job bringing life to every character. I found it pretty easy to distinguish each character and I had a vivid image of what they're like. In reading this book, it wouldn't hurt to know something about Russian ideas and such in the 19th century, but I certainly wouldn't say it's necessary. Reading the novel, despite Raskolinov's plot of murder, I found that I couldn't help liking the character and wanting things to work out for him. For the most part, he seemed like an educated and caring man. I think this novel provides an interesting look into the way in which one's conscience can practically drive a person mad, as it often does with the main character. Although the character is about Russian people in Russia, I don't think that made the story any less interesting as the theme of the novel had much more to do with human nature and little to do with the fact that the characters are Russian. I think most people will find characters and feelings in this book that they can relate to. Overall, I think this book is worth the read. I'm glad I read it and I think it's a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I expected this book to be an incredible read, a mind-altering study of guilt and conscience and other philosophical issues. Boy was I wrong. This book was just plain boring. At no point was it gripping, at no point did it force me to think, at no point did it introduce any ideas that contained even a hint of originality. The content was no more intelligent and thought-provoking than an episode of &quot;Friends.&quot; And the actual structure of the writing read like a second-grader's short story for English class. Maybe it was just the translation, but it was horrible. How many times did I see the combination of letters: &quot;Aach&quot;? That's not a word in English. Nor is it even a common expression. Nor is it the phoenetical spelling of a noise that I've ever heard. Couldn't the translator have come up with a better translation?

First off, the book is a great work of literature and a very good read. I needn't say more in that department as the other 5 star reviews here cover it well.But my theory is that publishers wanted long novels as being more marketable rather than novellas or short stories.

However, the character names take a while to get used to."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first read \\"Crime and Punishment\\" some thirty years ago. It's strange how one is occasionally drawn back to certain classics for a re-reading.\\"Crime and Punishment\\" details the mis-deeds of one Rodian Raskolinikov who is a poor and impoverished student in nineteenth century St. Petersburg. He dreams up the idea of murdering the local pawnbroker and collecting her money. This he does but as part of the process, the pawnbroker's sister stumbles across the crime and she too is murdered. This portion of the book is quite compelling. Dostoyevsky conveys the drama brilliantly. The scene sets the pulse racing as Raskolnikov succeeds in getting away with the crime. Indeed, this section is very good crime writing by any measure.Of course, as time proceeds, Raskolnikov's crime is gradually revealed. He has bizarre dreams of being like a latter day Napoleon:\\"to whom all is permitted, sacks Toulon, makes a slaughterhouse of Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, expends half a million men in a Moscow campaign, and gets off with a pun in Vilno; and when he dies they set up monuments to him - and thus everything is permitted\\"Such views are clearly delusional. Raskolnikov is no Napoleon. He is simply a grubby murderer. Society will not absolve him of responsibility. Ultimately, Siberia beckons.I'm not sure where this novel fits in with Dostoyevsky's other works. I will have to form a judgement here later. I have been drawn to read more of his great legacy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I had always wanted to read this book. At this price, I couldn't resist.

But this book is NOT a Penguin Classics; it is a Penguin POPULAR Classic. There is no introduction in the book and nowhere in the book will you find who did the translation or when it was done. Basically you don't know what you got. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I enjoyed this book and had attempted to read it in the past without success. With the kindle, I was able to listen to it during my daily commute and it helped to get me through some of the slower parts. I wish I had realized earlier on in the book that everyone has two names a formal one and a familiar one. It would have removed much of my confusion. If you can get past some minor mispronunciations, it is a great way to read the book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Anthony Heald's reading of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a marvel. Any reading of a book of this intricacy, with all of the voices, intonations, and length, is a tall task. What's more, the reader must have an outstanding grasp of the material, especially considering the psychology and philosophy that are so deeply embedded in Dostoevsky's texts. Given all of these considerations, Heald pulls off what is, in my mind, one of the best readings of a book ever. As someone categorically opposed to audiobooks, I find myself having relented on this one, because of how enjoyable this reading is!In addition, Heald does not make any of the errors in pronunciation that one might come to expect from a Westerner's reading of \\"Crime and Punishment.\\" The only thing more irritating than a mispronunciation of names is having to decipher the translated text through a thick Russian accent. I am pleased to report that neither of these concerns are an issue in Heald's reading.Finally, I must make some comment about the wonderful theatrical ability that Anthony Heald demonstrates. Many book readers fail to understand just how important it is to perform the book while reading it. Actors, like Heald, know the importance of different techniques and gestures, even though they are giving a presentation in audio format. Traditional book readers miss this all together, but anyone who watches a Hollywood audio recording for an animated film has seen that the actors perform while recording audio. The effect of this, sometimes subtle, sometimes very notable, is an aesthetic that really gets the listener into and feeling what the book is trying to convey. Also, this challenges the quality of the recording itself, which, I must say, stands the test, as all Blackstone audiobooks do.This reading of Crime and Punishment is an absolute joy, so I hope you partake!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"After reading a number of the new and celebrated Russian translators, I came back to this old version of Crime and Punishment and realized what I had been missing. The newer translators may be technically more accurate. And from time to time the may seem more colloquial. But they never capture the verve and the passion that epitomizes the great Russians. This novel especially flourishes under the hand of Garnett, who got not just the language and the culture but the essential frenzy of Dostoyevsky."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My reading of Crime and Punishment was the start of what I hope to be a revisiting of numerous Russian classics. I read all the big guns (barring War and Peace) many years ago and, quite frankly, got NOTHING out of them. I was confused, bored, confused, unable to wade through the thick writing, confused and, lastly, confused.I should probably address my confusion. I am, in real life as well as in art, an absolute clod at handling peoples' names. And it is common in the writing of many languages for characters to be referred to with various handles. In Russian you have the complete name, the last name, and the familiar name all interchanged willy nilly. So your main character will be Raskolnikov for the first ten pages and then suddenly someone named Rodya will be addressed. And you're supposed to know with zero instruction that this is Raskolnikov's nickname, or familiar address. Which is fine. I shorten Elizabeth to Liz or Thomas to Tom or Richard to Dick (though I've never understood that last one). But when it's a nickname for a giant name in a foreign language that I hadn't grasped much to begin with and has very little to do with the original name and there is zero hand-holding given...well I get lost. Combine three names per character with 12 or 13 main characters and for me it's a complete cluster-f**k of proper nouns that I have a hard time keeping straight.Ten years ago I was lost, now I managed to keep my head in the game and sort out what name referred to whom with, for me, shocking accuracy.I know that seems like a terribly superficial thing to dwell on, but nothing has effected my ability to enjoy Russian literature more than this. And I'm not saying it should change, again, this is standard fare for many languages, but man does it make for some rough going.Okay, that's out of the way, now onto the book. The book is awesome. Somehow I missed this ten years ago. It's a brilliantly gripping story of murder told mainly through the eyes of the murderer. Raskolnikov's madness and rambling thoughts are beautifully painted as well as his struggles during lucid moments to come to terms with what he actually believes. This struggle takes place amid tons of philosophical ramblings from all the characters. But the philosophies discussed were only barely overwritten (I generally have little patience for authors who let a character take ten pages to pontificate on their personal philosophy...a few sentences, sure, but I've never been out drinking and heard anyone talk for twenty minutes straight about the nature of man. It just doesn't happen and whenever I catch an author doing this it pulls me out of the story). The cast of characters were interesting, the numerous subplots of blackmail, coercion, love and desperate attempts to cling to the past were all fascinating. Not to mention you get a very interesting twist on the classic Who-Done-It here where...well you *know* \\"Who Did It.\\" You watch him do it. And yet the book manages to keep the police investigation interesting and believable as well as cast just enough doubt on what on earth actually happened due to Raskolnikov's somewhat unreliable viewpoint.And then, after all of this, at the end, you are suddenly given just a stunningly beautiful affirmation of humanity and love that came so out of nowhere yet had a perfect foundation under it that I got chills up and down.I can't wait to read this again in ten years...maybe even less...depends on how long War and Peace takes me."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I remembered reading this back in High school, and hating it! I thought the plan was completely dull and lacked any excitement that I guess I was used to seeing on TV. Reading now, about a decade later, feels like reading through completely different eyes and definately more meaningful to me now. I guess its more about how much I can relate to how he thinks when faced with such adversity and misery while goingn through the \\"lows\\" in his life. The feeling of sinking lower and lower I think its captured perfectly and I guess its a classic for a reason.

To others, it may be just another grim Russian novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment is the first classic detective story. But that is not even where it excels. With the Brothers Karamazov, it elevated Dostoyevsky to a mega writer when it comes to dissecting the mind and soul of characters for the readers. It is a great book of psychology. While it competes with Anna Karenina as the most widely read 19th century Russian novel in the English-speaking world, it is judged by many to be superior in its depth and lessons. The book's hero exemplifies all young ideologues who are wrestling with a new idea which they think can elevate them to the levels of great historic figures in their initial steps towards greatness. Often, a barrier has to be crossed which takes the potential legendary figure into an irreversible course. In Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov who is the hero is a poor, intelligent and thoughtful student who is convinced that he has a mission for the advancement of mankind. He convinces himself that the mission has to start with him crossing over to greatness by robbing and killing an old woman, a pawnbroker, whose death, he had convinced himself would do the world more good than harm. This conviction is based on his judgment that she cheats her clients and holds money that could be used for humanity. He then commits the murder, but is forced to kill the pitiful Elizabetha, the landlady's sister. The novel begins its twists and turns after these murders, with the introduction of the cunning detective who gets to investigate the murder and makes Raskolnikov his principal suspect. Raskolnikov gets to meet the destitute Marmeladovs through the alcoholic father, and is distraught by the plight of his consumptive mother, her three young children, and Sonya-Marmeladov's eighteen-year old daughter who is forced into prostitution in order to support the family.By doing a rich psychology development of his characters, Dostoyevsky made his characters more complexly human, yet reachable. Sonya emerges as a saintly figure who sins for the sakes of those she loves , and who is the mirror through which the so-called devilish characters are redeemed. The plot is rich, deep, enjoyable and action-packed; and the pace is fast and engaging. The overriding strength of the story is the conflict in Raskolnikov's soul, a conflict which began in his quest to be the \\"Extraordinary Man\\" like Napoleon, by stepping over the basic bounds of morality by committing murder. Conflict in the soul is a rich theme which I also saw in the story The Union Muzhik. That conflict in his soul brought out the rich ideas, discussions and emotions from the characters that interacted with him."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The price is pretty steep for a book you can dl for free -- even from Amazon for free.

If you do the \\"Look Inside\\" thing on this book, you'll see the inside of another version of the book, NOT the one you will receive.To give you a few quotes from the publishers website: \\"We created your book using OCR software ..... with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....

When you look at the (paperback) edition of Crime and Punishment translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, it says right below it, \\"Start reading Crime and Punishment on your Kindle...\\" and also lists the different versions available - paperback, hardcover, etc. - and includes a Kindle Edition. But when you click on either, you get this, which is a completely different translation. Pevear and Volokhonsky have been widely praised, their translations now considered far and away the best English versions available of various classic works of Russian Literature. But Amazon lumps everything with the same title as if it were the same product. Some of the customer-uploaded images of the book's cover even say that it is the Pevear and Volokhonsky version, but it is not. It's a 1914 translation by Constance Garnett.This is the reason people started to hate big box and online bookstores when they first started putting neighborhood bookstores out of business -- because they don't seem to care about books, just making money. But what's funny here is that they could actually charge money for the better translation, since it's new, but instead they choose to give away an inferior version and pretend it's the same thing. (They do offer the Pevear and Volokhonsky version of Demons for a price - a version easier to distinguish because the newer translation even changes the title from the less-accurate The Possessed - versions with that title are available for free.) Also, because they don't distinguish between different translations, there is no button available under the Pevear and Volokhonsky version to request that the publisher make it available for Kindle.It's also difficult to know what version of a book is being reviewed sometimes. I'll be reading reviews on the Kindle Edition page, and the reviewer will describe the fine leather binding. This is especially frustrating now that I realize the actual content - the language - of the book I'm buying could be different from the one I read about online.Since getting my Kindle, I've been impressed by the machine itself, but thoroughly unimpressed by Amazon's handling of content. They should focus less exclusively on getting people to buy the device, and work harder at improving the way they sell books and other content for it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I initially approached this book with a great deal of trepidation. I had never read Dostoyevsky, and was concerned that I would get bogged down in some lengthy, mind-numbingly boring, nineteenth-century treatise on the bestial nature of man or something. I am happy to report this is not the case. Instead, and to my delight, it is a smoothly flowing and fascinating story of a young man who succumbs to the most base desire, and the impact this has both psychologically and otherwise on himself and those around him.To be sure, the book seems wordy in places, but I suspect this has to do with the translation. And what translator in his right mind would be bold enough to edit the great Dostoyevsky? But this is a very minor problem.What we get with Dostoyevsky is dramatic tension, detailed and believable human characters, and brilliant insight into human nature. Early in the novel our hero meets and has a lengthy conversation with Marmeladov, a drunkard. This conversation is never uninteresting and ultimately becomes pathetic and heartbreaking, but I kept wondering why so much time was spent on it. As I got deeper into the book, I understood why this conversation was so important, and realized that I was in the hands of a master storyteller. This is also indicative of the way in which the story reveals itself. Nothing is hurried. These people speak the way we actually speak to one another in real life, and more importantly, Dostoyevsky is able to flesh out his characters into whole, three-dimensional human beings.And what a diverse group of characters! Each is fleshed out, each is marvelously complex. Razujmikhin, the talkative, gregarious, good-hearted, insecure and destitute student; Sonia, the tragic child-prostitute, with a sense of rightness in the world; Petrovich, the self-important, self-made man, completely out of touch with his own humanity; Dunia, the honorable, wronged sister: we feel like we know these people because we've met people like them. They fit within our understanding of the way human beings are.Dostoyevsky also displays great insight into human nature. Svidrigailov, for example, talks of his wife as liking to be offended. &quot;We all like to be offended,&quot; he says, &quot;but she in particular loved to be offended.&quot; It suddenly struck me how true this is. It gives us a chance to act indignantly, to lash out at our enemies, to gain favor with our allies. I don't believe I've ever seen this thought expressed in literature before. In fact, it never occurred to me in real life! Petrovich, Dunia's suitor, not only expects to be loved, but because of his money, and her destitution, he expects to be adored! To be worshipped! He intentionally sought out a woman from whome he expected to get this, and is comletely flummoxed when she rejects him. His is an unusual character, but completely realized.There is so much more to talk about: the character of Raskolnikov, which is meticulously and carefully revealed; the sense of isolation which descends on him after committing his crime; the cat and mouse game played on him by the police detective. I could go on and on. I haven't even mentioned the historical and social context in which this takes place. Suffice to say this is a very rich book.Do not expect it to be a rip-roaring page turner. Sit down, relax, take your time, and savor it. It will be a very rewarding experience. And thank you SL, for recommending it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you read one murder novel in the rest of your life, read \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It's only 500 pages but it speaks volumes.I discovered Dostoyevsky a few months ago while I was deployed to Iraq and my literary world will never been the same.I found a copy of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" in a pile of miscellenious books that had been dedicated to troops to boost morale and took it to a literary savvy Lt. Col. I knew. When I showed him my find, he insisted I read Crime and Punishment first. I'm certainly glad I decided to take his advice.Crime and Punishment tells the story of a brutal murder in pre- revolutionary Russa and the emotional torment of the eccentric murderer, Raskolnikov. The book is as dark and suspenseful as anything I've ever read, but it also manages to convey things on the opposite end of the emotional spectrum like redemption and love. My favorite passage of the book (a hard pick, for sure) is when Porfiry, a jovial but formitable detective, interrogates Raskolnikov.The deployment is over, but my infatuation with Dostoyevsky's books has just begun. I'm now reading \\"The Idiot\\" and enjoying it, though it's too early to see if it matches \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"Whether you are deployed to the farthest reaches of the world or sitting comfortably at home, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" promises to be an exhilerating read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I chose to read this book in my quest to read all those books I was supposed to read in school and never did.

The book had a lot more action than I expected, an amazing story line, great characters, and some of the best writing I've read. I started this book expecting to dislike it, and now it's my second favorite book I've ever read.If you have a kindle and are looking for a new book to read, there is absolutely NO reason you shouldn't get this book.

There are many books that stay with a person, days or weeks after reading them, but Crime and Punishment is one of the few that live on forever. After reading the book, my eyes have been opened to the light of the human soul. Raskolnikov, the central character, is an unmotivated, destitute man. He is symbolic of the so called &quot;dirt&quot;, that the world tries so desperately to rid. The novels plot is tight as they come, but it is Dostoevsky's supreme insight and reality into the mind of a killer, Raskolnikov, that makes this novel a testament to genius. Some may read this novel to be &quot;well-read&quot;, I say read this novel to gain the foothold to the bottom of your own soul. It will help you gain the realization of self, with a better understanding of the society that can bring men down and subsequently lift them up.

I was blown away when I read this. I clearly wasn't expecting this level of writing and engagement. I know the classics have a lot of impact on people, but not on this level. This is a deep book with a lot of philosophical and practical insights into the human condition. I don't like to sound cliched, but truly, the stories and ideas it tells is timeless, and as such, relevant even until today. It engaged me to read and reflect on my own life and thoughts; among other things, it made me realize how wonderfully, wonderfully lucky I am in my circumstances despite my everyday complaints. It is a tale of life told through the lens of a man, much like you and me, full of conviction, ambition, and inner conflict. It is a story of possibility, irony, tragedy, and hope."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is Dostoevski's greatest masterpiece. Supposedly, he was in a prison camp lying on a bunk serving time for fostering radical ideas against the Russian regime when the idea came to him. If your favorite author is John Grisham or Stephen King, you should skip it, because the ideas presented are so deep and masterful, you must peel the layers off each character slowly and painfully to fully understand and comprehend the vision Dostoevski was trying to convey.Crime and Punishment is the one book of Dostoevski's which is different from his other four big novels. In the Possessed, Brothers Karamozov, Idiot, and Raw Youth, Dostoevski usually presents his structure very much like a play. He introduces his characters and like the end of a first act, he has them come together in one room and something dramatic happens, whether it is Natasha throwing money in the fire, or Stavrogin getting slapped in the face. Crime and Punishment does not follow his usual form. The drama occurs in the very first chapters and the rest unfolds itself through that one act. This is a book of religious affirmation, don't forget that when reading, and Dostoevski makes a personal statement at the end which should not be brushed off. The story is thrilling and intellectual, but it's up to you, the reader, to make it so, because the book itself can't do it. It's you actively thinking about the various ideas presented that will create the images needed to absorb the brilliance you keep hearing about."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When I was a literature student in college, Ray Malbone, the professor who taught the English Novel said to us on the first day of class \\"You are here to save your souls.\\" What he meant was, that great novelists are always aiming to persuade you to enter into and adopt their worldview. Dostoevsky was literally out to 'save the soul' of Russia from the corruption of alien thinking that had invaded her intellectual life and dragged her people away from simple orthodoxy.One generally reads this novel as a young person, when one is, like Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, experimenting with extreme ideas. Don't be even momentarily deceived by all the excursions into Neitsche-like ideas of freedom from restraint. Instead, recognize that Dostoevsky was not just a religious conservative but an outright reactionary, and you won't lose your way in any of the tangled thoughts and specious arguments that tangle young Rodya's literally and figuratively fever-tortured brain. Make no mistake about it, Rodya has sinned against God and his neighbor, and he must be 'born again' to get out of the dreadful mess he's wandered into.So what makes this novel not a tract that would bore us, but a deeply moving psychic journey that draws us with its tension and distress?First, this isn't really a story about what a murderer is like. For that, go and read \\"The Devils\\" or \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" in which you will see the disgusting and horrifying spectacles of lost souls working out their foul destinies. Rodion is NOT like a murderer. That is the most striking thing about him. Indeed, almost any reader will admit to having identified with him and feeling great sympathy for his anguish at almost all times during the novel. He deeply loves his mother and sister. We learn that he has done heroic actions in saving children from a fire. He finds himself again and again unable to restrain impulses of the deepest generosity--saving an abandoned and drunken waif from a predatory man, listening with compassion to a drunkard, carrying that same drunkard home when he is broken and dying, emptying his pockets to the last kopeck to help his family, treating the man's young, prostituted daughter with respect and honor. To Dostoevsky, Rodya represents the finest among young Russian intellectuals.What happens to him then? He becomes possessed or obsessed with those French-German ideas that have invaded the motherland. It's not so much that he THINKS his way to this murder, as that the depraved philosophies of the west get into him like a bacterium or a virus and possess his will, until he is compelled to carry out an action he knows beforehand (as he realizes afterward) will make him know that he is 'no better than a louse.'The true greatness of the novel is in Dostoevsky's astonishingly acute observation of every thought, grimace, and piece of behavior produced by Raskolnikov when he is in this sick state of mind and soul. Hard to remember that the novel was written well before modern psychiatric theory was propounded--so precisely does Dostoevsky distinguish each outward and visible sign of the unconscious drive toward truth, confession, and atonement that possesses Raskolnikov's whole being the moment the compulsion to do murder has its denouement in ghastly action.I give this novel four stars not because it isn't great--it is--but because Dostoevsky went on to write far greater things. This is best read first among Dostoevsky's novels, because later ones are darker and more difficult to decipher. Readers won't be a bit lost in this straightforward wtory, as long as they hold fast to the knowledge that Christianity--specifically Russian Orthodox Christianity as opposed to Roman Catholicism--is where Dostoevsky keeps his moral center firmly fixed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There's no denying the fact that the novels of Dostoevsky are quite difficult to read especially when it comes to the names of the characters. But I certainly admit that his works are veritable masterpieces.It took me six weeks to finish Crime & Punishment but the whole reading experience was gratifying.Dostoevsky's belief in God is very evident in his writings - amid the communism and atheism prevalent in Russia during those days.In this novel, the Dostoevsky once again explored the mind of a criminal- the darkness that lurks, the fear and paranoia, the perennial battle between the good and the bad, the hope for moral redemption and the quest for spiritual salvation.Not every body will appreciate this novel, Dostoevsky may not be that popular in this time and age but his works turned me wet on classical literature forever."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Before picking up Crime and Punishment, I could count on one hand the number of classics I'd read - Jane Eyre, Frankenstein, and a good deal of short stories and poetry. I saw the brilliance in them, to be sure, but was never really able to connect with them. Crime and Punishment was different. In addition to being an amazingly powerful piece of literature, it also happens to be vastly entertaining. If you'd like to get into reading the classics, but haven't been engaged by those you've tried, this is definitely recommended reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Most summaries of this book viciously oversimplify it, saying something like &quot;The main character is driven by guilt to confess a murder&quot; or some such. Actually, in true Dostoyevskyan (to coin a phrase) form, the motives for the confession are understandable yet curiously undefinable. For the entire book, one can understand why Raskolnikov thinks and feels as he does, yet one can never quite explain it (in that sense, he is very true-to-life) Deeply Christian, this book is essentially about rebirth. Raskolnikov is redeemed by the relentless goodness of Sofya, the patience of Razumikhin and, in an odd way, even by the police inspector, Porfiry, who maneuvres Raskolnikov into confessing. Everything is so seemlessly woven together, that this book has almost the beauty of form of a great poem."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'll admit I had to read this for school but I ended up loving it in a way I'd never imagined! For its length, it's actually very fast moving, with most of the action/dialogue taking place within a few days. The characters are amazing and moved me to deep feelings of pity, understanding, hatred or concern. The imagery was also uniquely fascinating and will certainly remain with me for a long time to come. This book had an atmosphere that was almost tangible. Dostoyevsky and his host of characters with names a unpronounceable as his own have definitely made an impact on me. I heartily encourage you to give Crime and Punishment a trial of your own!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You can debate the philosophical and spiritual implications of this book until the cows come home, but that leaves you with a tendency to neglect the amazing entertainment value of this exquisite novel.It manages to have the deep and powerful sweep of Dickens or Hugo, but without ever becoming dull or slowing its pace in the slightest. The dialogue is witty, sharp, emotionally powerful and very revealing of the characters' personality, and the characters...oh, the characters!You have the unequalled honest, warm charm and amazing wit of Razumikhin. You've got the fascinating loathsome Peter Luzhin, and that devious, pervasive, terrifying embodiment of retribution Porfiry Petrovich. You've got Luzhin's hilarious communist roommate, whose name is absurdly long and complex even by Russian standards, and the tragic alcoholic clerk Marmeladov. You've got poor, tragic, half-crazed Svidrigailov (my single favorite character in the entire book), the deep, pious, passionate prostitute Sonia...and of course, Raskolnikov himself, the quintessential human being. He's a bit comparable of Hugo's Valjean, except more flawed and far more realistic.The book is one of the very best I've ever been exposed to. For those of you afraid of getting into so heavy and powerful a novel, let me tell you that for something this deep and rewarding, it is an amazingly easy and gripping read. Don't be afraid...just get the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have always been a huge Dostoyevsky fan and I think that this book is his finest in a long line of good books. It is a dark novel of that will haunt you for days after you have read the epilogue. Raskolnikov is a fascinating main character that you can't help but like even if he is a petty criminal. It is a good read that has some literary weight and will keep you interested until the very end. I recommend it to everyone who wants to read a good book that is more than just fluff."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book of my own accord during the summer before I started college. Honestly, there could have been no better book for me to read. With the bigheadedness and desire to prove something that often come hand in hand with higher education, a student must always check himself so as not to start down the wrong path towards egotism. Egotism will surely lead to thoughts of one's own superiority. This is where the main character in 'Crime and Punishment' goes wrong. He fancies himself a genius and an anomoly among the 'idiots' in St. Petersburg. Therefore, if he were to exceed the law in order to further his own genius for the betterment of humanity (like, for instance, Napolean) it would be perfectly legitimate. One problem: Rodya is a bigheaded student with a thirst to prove something and, unfortunately, is not a genius nor does he offer anything to justify a crime by way of societal betterment.Along his psychological journey through guilt, self-righteousness, egotism, arrogance, intolerance, and frustration; he finds simplicity and relentless care through some of the most absurdly 'un-genius' and 'common' of folk. Rodya finds a student unwilling to accept the bitterness of men even beyond the most brutal verbal assualts, a woman unreasonably devoted to a hopeless family and a non-existent God (at least in Rodya's mind), and a sister who does not need to ponder the complexities of life and take into account her tribulations in order to love her exsitence without reservation.'Crime and Punishment' is thought-provoking, powerful, sometimes tragic, oftentimes absurdly funny and witty, and ultimately uplifting. Here's an except of the book that clearly shows its message: \\"[Rodya] dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strangle plague...Some new sorts of microbes were attackning the bodies of men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will...Never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of truth as these sufferers, never had they considered their decisions...so infallible...Each thought that he alone had the truth...Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite.\\" Sorry, long excerpt, but Dosteovsky's intent was to say that if every man took the time to dissected the complexities of life and form their own opinions on every topic; then firstly, no one would have time for happiness; secondly, those opinions would evolve into forceful convictions causing everyone to argue and later kill everyone else in the name of some ridiculous opinion; thridly, nothing would be making the world turn if there were no working class; and finally, every man would be imprisoned by the ferocity and supposed 'infallibility' of his own independent thought. I love Dosteovsky...bloody genius!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a complex, rich, and deeply satisfying work. Indeed, the story is far too complex to relate it in this space. What you need to know is that the story centers around the consequences of one man's horrible action, committing a murder. Much of the story is spent exploring the psychology of guilt and what happens to this man when he breaks so thoroughly with the his own human nature.The author shows, in detail, what becomes of men and society when intellectualism, individualism, and all of the many other 'isms that affected Russia at the time this story was written are taken to their logical conclusion. Humans are more than the sum of their thoughts, and tradgedy is sure to ensue when we shut off the rest of our nature.Ultimately, Crime and Punishment is a morality tale. What happens when men refuse the mores of a society to prove that they are unneeded? What happens when men convince themselves that they are special and above the law?This story is long, complex, and rich. Do not try to rush through it. Read this in the quiet times of your day and absorb each part slowly. You'll find it to be the literary equivalent of an extremely fine wine."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov's moral dilemma, the beautiful Russian person and place names -- the marvelous way they roll around on the tongue, and the vivid historical setting - czarist Russia, make Crime and Punishment a classic of 19th Century world literature.Dostoevsky's masterpiece should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves well educated, as it carefully and artfully melds together a classic philosophical quandary with fantastic literary craftsmanship. Particular attention obviously should be directed towards Raskolnikov's wrestling with his own mind and ethical precepts. Most readers can assuredly relate to similar questions of value in their own lives.Homicide's never been analyzed in such depth from the perspective of the perpetrator who of course happens to be the protaganist. It's this angle that Dostoevsky takes particular advantage of and makes the book hard to put down."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is perhaps the original psychological thriller and suspense novel. A young, disaffected student, Raskolnikov, ruminates over the nature of his own miserable poverty, drops out of school and is consumed with his romantic condition of ennui. (Today- a clinical depression.) In a stupor, and supposing himself to be merely reviewing the possibilities, he murders an old moneylender and then, to save his skin, he murders her sister. Although he feels no 'conscious' remorse, he swoons in halluncinatory fever and betrays himself by his shaking hands, hypervigilant questions and sleep talk. The rest of the novel is a sort of \\"Tell Tale Heart\\" of suspicion, strange accusers and sudden dream walks which take him to the crime scene and thus alert his would-be captors. The inner torment and the outer pursuit merge together- he cannot tell what is real and what is a dream. Neither can the reader.C&P; is Dowstoyevski's most accessible novel and the only one that can be enjoyed for the story alone. Except for the end, which drags on too much for my patience, the tale moves briskly with edge of the seat tension, swerves and turns in the plot and not a little vice. Of the latter there is drunkenness, prostitution, rape and shameless misuse of money and trust. There is constant uncertainty and characters who are not what they appear. Raskolnikov, and other ambiguously moral characters suddenly arise as generous, selfless and sympathetic. Similary they are enormously cold and cruel, often to their beloveds and dependents. Typical for his age and status our hero is full of weak theories and flabby nihilism. The author takes aim at those upper class Marixist apologists prophetically imagining the blood and anarchy that would soon envelop Russian destiny. He pokes fun as well at the pompous adherents of the \\"new\\" science of psychology. Seeing into the future, no wonder, he was dreary and reactionary. There are a handful of those comic asides- not nearly as many as in Karamazov and his shorter novels, but a fairly good stab is taken at the latest literary artists- at himself.His struggle and the manic extremes in the nation and his individual soul is, the bare force that burnt away creatively and timelessly.Great book- for the story and then for the cross-section of that time and unique place, Petersburg, post- Napoleon and pre-Revolution."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm a big Dostoyevski fan, but Crime and Punishment has a special place in my heart: when I was a student (and flat broke), a friend and I took turns reading the book aloud. We laughed our asses off, especially during the scene in the tavern with Marmaladev. (there's also a very funny comic book edition of the book, which reads like one extended non sequitor. example quote: the police inspector tells Raskolnikov, \\"I know you killed that little old woman and her daughter, but I trust you, and know you'll do the right thing.\\" look for this edition in your finer bookstores)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Not all classics are created equal and call me crazy but I hardly consider Dostoevsky altogether an author, much less one of the prestigious classical breed! I do love Tolstoy so this is not a case of not understanding Russian authors. I also love the classics. I just didn't like Dostoevsky AT ALL!And yes I did finish it and I would like to share why I despised it so much.The plot - a young student murdering an old, unpleasant pawn-broker and having to deal with the psychological aftermath - could have been promising, if not for the story telling, the writing style, the character depiction. In short, if not written by Dostoevsky.The author then goes into these monstrous proportions of expressing everything in the characters' minds without relating any one thing to another or tying any of it to the overall plot in even a remotely tangible way. He - the author - is nearly as disturbed and as much on the verge of insanity as his protagonist, Rascolnikov, and while it may sound fascinating, it does not bode well for story-telling of any kind. He subjects us to every unfinished thought, every draft of an idea, every whim and notion, every passing fancy, fantasy and delusion in Rascolnikov's head and yet does not allow us to arrive at any possible sensible conclusion. Following either a conversation or a monologue anywhere in the book is akin to going on a winding roller coaster ride without the remotest thrill - and repeating that cycle a few hundred times until the last page of the book.It is this miserable style of Dostoevsky's story telling which numbed my interest and robbed me of any compassion toward any character whatsoever, for how could an author inspire our compassion or interest when he insists on not telling the story and on not communicating with the reader and instead on leading us on a path which ends in utter incoherence and confusion?\\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a meaningless, maddening maze with no point, no beginning and no end, no purpose, no plot and especially, no prose and no, I do not recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have failed to see what so many people see in this book.

This book talked about how a criminal goes about committing crimes and what they think when they are planning a crime.

So that I won't even try to deny. I mean, after he killed the two ladies I felt guilty!!

There are people like this man in the world, of that I have no doubt, but through their pains, sufferings, and guilty consience, things will not be alright, and this is something that should not even be suggested to the weak and fickle minds of today.

It started off brightly, piquing my interest with the story of a young man (Raskalnikoff) contemplating murder for reasons that are not initially made clear. The murder occurs and Dostoevsky then spends the next 300 pages dragging the (anti-climactic) conclusion out and telling me very little of interest in the process.Raskalnikoff's 'Great Man' theory was the only major concept which stoked my flames of thought. From a book entitled Crime and Punishment I expected to gain insights into the nature of crime and consequently punishment. However, I acquired no new understandings about the topic and was left wondering why this novel was so widely acclaimed, or was I just not 'getting' it? From a philosophical point of view there are so few nuggets to be plucked from the pages, especially considering the amount of time invested.This is not a bad novel by any means - there are positives. The novel is very well written with Dostoevsky skillfully painting a picture of the gloomy and miserable St Petersburg of the time, populated with diverse and intriguing characters. However, no matter how good the writing is it is content that counts and this is where the novel fell flat for me. I didn't get much out of the novel; others have; maybe you will - it's your call."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book should be written in one-third of its original size.

Raskolnikov, who is only 24 when the novel begins, cannot live as he wants to, so he is left to his own thoughts, to unhealthy and endless brooding. He begins to yearn for blood and rationalizes his primordial anger and hatred as some sort of premonition of greatness. And the means to achieving greatness are not alwasy good--after all, did Napoleon lose much sleep over the people who fell victim to his military campaigns? Raskolnikov decides to start with a robbery, but when things do not go according to plan, he commits two murders. In the end, his conscience turns against him, so that he hasn't a moment of peace.

It was suspenseful, captivating, and well-written. The characters seemed very real and life-like.

The details of the scenes of the murder, the police station, and the trampling of Marmeladov were very explicit and well-written. The only bad points of the book are the use of Old English spelling and grammar, and that the story is sometimes hard to follow. The book has excellent detail and was captivating and full of suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to tackle the 493 pages. Overall, it was a good book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"&quot;So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way.&quot; This one quote is in essence Raskolnikov.

It's intoxicating, entertaining, detailed, big, psychologically complex, thoughtful, aesthetically rich, dramatically appealing, and thoroughly rewarding.

I think this book was probably the best work of Dostoevsky. In my personal view I believe that the beginning was much better then the end. The character of Roskolnikov was developed as an angry young man who sees world through morbidly vexed eyes. The ending was a bit disappointing since the character of Roskolnikov was stripped down from an angry young man to a creature that is morally and emotionally destroyed. Dostoevsky perhaps knew better what he intended to accomplish from this book, but in my humble opinion the book should have ended without capitulating Roskolnikov to a standards of the so called \`civilization.' But then Roskolnikov does mean the one who confesses....."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is an intensely psychological book that delves into the mentality of a killer and the long, arduous path to salvation. Furthermore, Crime and Punishment illustrates the need for faith in a cold, godless world. Particularly, Dosteovsky focuses on Raskolikov, a brilliant young college student who commits a pointless murder at the whims of an experiment. As the days after the crime elapse, Raskolnikov becomes a whithered, tortured soul who becomes engaged with the clever police chief. Dosteovsky's depiction of the psychological cat and mouse affair between Raskolnikov and the police chief provides a rare glimpse into the torturous psyche of guilt. Beautifully written, touching and extremely moralizing, Crime and Punishment is a lucid fable that endures to this day, a tale whose theme is still as valid as our society slowly, as in the words of Judge Robert Bork, \\"slouches towards Gomorrah.\\""},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and punishment is, in a single word, an outstanding literary work. It tells the harrowing tale of an ex-student, driven to murder, and the aftermath of his actions. It is superbly written and loses none of the passion and emotion through the translation from russian.The book holds the readers attention, its insight into the main charachters mind keeping you interested untill the end. The writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky manages to extract an amazing tale from the bleak, severe surroundings of russia in which it is set.In closing, I feel that Crime and Punishment is a book thet everyone should read at least once in their lifetime. It is a thought provoking book, offering deep insights into the human mind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"As I said, this novel is definitely slow-paced, so for those whose attention spans are shorter than the average television commercial, you are being forewarned.That aside, this is an absolutely marvelous book, combining elements of mystery and crime with disturbing psychology and provocative philosophy. The story concerns a poor Russian youth named Raskalnikov who has decided that murdering an elderly pawnbroker for her wealth is just because she is a societal leech who contributes nothing. He is blinded by his own poverty and deluded by his Neitzschean philosophy concerning 'extraordinary men' and their rights to commit heinous acts for the general betterment of humanity. Problems arise when he falls in love and is also hounded by two men, one a police officer and another a scoundrel.The story is well-translated in that it is clear and concise, and, by all accounts, preserves the story nicely. The writing itself is readable, and the more philosophical passages are definitely intriguing.Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I recently read this book, as my first ever of Dostoevsky, and I must say that i now fully understand why he has been hailed as one of the greatest writers ever. His splendid characteristics, his insanely deep, and by my opinion accurate, psychological observations alone raises this book to new, dizzying heights according to my way of wieving litterature. In addition to this, the story is most inticing, and the intreagues excellently built up. This keeps the reader riveted, and makes this extraordinarily good book very hard to put aside.There's no doubt in my mind: it deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevksy marvelously illustrates the effect that guilt has on the human mind. Raskolnikov, an idealist and impoverished youth, finds himself committing a murder to help his people, but he is slowly transformed, along with his social theories. The unexplainable guilt gnaws at him until he changes his mind about his motives, his morals, and his faith. He realizes that social and economic change do not happen through murder, but through charity and hard work, which he learns through helping the prostitute daugher of a drunkard, as well as his own poor family. He accepts religion and God, as a way to repent and make his life more meaningful, and slowly he drives himself toward a confession..... This is a classic and outstanding book"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov is a young student in 19th century Petersburg. He quits school because he can't afford to put himself through, he has sold most of his Earthly possessions so that he can eat, and then he takes the life of a wealthy pawnbroker and robs her house because he feels a sense of entitlement. This story brings the 19th century of Russia to life, Raskolnikov is such an intriguing character, and its characters are one of the book's greatest strengths. The settings are vivid, the plot itself is wonderful. The book is very coherent, it loses little in the translation, which is a credit to the translator, because a bad translator can screw up a book like this. This is a great book and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is an exciting novel that explored ideas that were way before its time. It is the story of a troubled young man, Raskolnikov, who commits a double murder, and how he deals with the ramifications of his act. Dostoevesky gives his readers a full and complex view of all of the characters, and in the end, you can't help sympathizing with Raskolnikov. Though the russian names are at first puzzling, once you get the hang of them it is easy reading. There are many characters who seem minor, but many develop into important pieces of the plot. Whether or not you end up forgiving Raskolnikov, this is a pyschological novel that forces the reader to look at all aspects of a person's life and then make a final judgement."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first read this book when I was fifteen years old and absolutely loved it. Dostoyevsky's depiction of Raskolnikov made him like no other character that I have come across in a novel. The author made Raskolnikov's fear and guilt come alive in a way that no other author could have. I could not help but become anxious along with Raskolnikov as he realized the enormity of the crime that he had committed. Dostoyevsky was truly a master of the psychological thriller."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There's no need to go into detailing this classic pshycological study on a warped individual. It covers the full spectrum of emotions, from inner strenghts to utter indifference. Throw in an intelligent detective that uses these same feelings to trap the murderer, a good hearted friend, two loving women, and of course the dreary setting of mid nineteenth century Russia and you have a well written and thought provoking novel. The long critisized ending also provides for a somewhat positive ending. A sequel would have been quite interesting. Dostoevsky uses somewhat similar characters and emotions in his other classic, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; If you enjoy a study into the inner mind with some interesting outcomes you would do well to read both of these important works."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This was one of the most entertaining stories I have ever read. I was immediately taken in by the plot and fascinated by Raskolnikov's \\"experiment\\". I know a lot of people don't think that long Russian novels are going to be a lot of fun, but this book was. It had an odd, dark sense of humor that I really enjoyed, and one of the most interesting debates over the morality of various life choices I've ever seen. It was really accessible to the modern reader and I think all that speaks to its timelessness."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevski is a powerful and wonderful author, and I have read most of his books. His books are long and complex and perhaps this particular book is the most complex of all. Dostoevsky himself spent time in prison, and his experiences and the soul searching that he did there come out in this book. The theme that runs through this book is that man inevitably pays for his crimes by suffering, and through that suffering he may in fact receive redemption. This book is about a paranoid schizophrenic by the name of Raskolnikov. He causes a lot of harm to people because of his own grandiose idea of his own superiority. But all the harm that he causes he pays for in his own tortured mind. A powerful and sometimes hard to read book because Dostoevsky's characters are so real, and we feel their pain and suffering with them as we read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"...after reading the one star reviews read the best book of all times and you'll understand part of my agony... Raskolnykov."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Be warned; this book is not for those who require suspense and action in their reading, nor is it who enjoy complex interactions and emotional scenes between characters. Granted, this book does contain both these elements in various places, but other than the scene of the murder, the pacing is slow, and until somewhere in the middle of the book, the focus is on Raskolnikov alone. Those who read and enjoyed \\"Anna Karenina\\" but found themselves dragging through the lengthy descriptions of Levin's solitary musings will find the entirety of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" in the same vein. This book is a psychological thriller; Rasknolnikov's conflicts are internal as he struggles to come to terms with his crime, his guilt, the inherent nature of his personality, and ultimately, the value of the human being.After a slow start, I found this book to be surprisingly pleasant, despite its rather dark plot. If you can make it through the first hundred or so pages, the rest should be an interesting, if not entirely riveting, read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This wordy book is easily one of the best i have ever read and really allows you to see the consequences of the crime.Raskolnikov, Sonya, Razumukin, and the rest are all extremely likeable and sympathetic characters. Each one has their own problems and struggles told in this beautiful book. And the work of the investigator Porfiry is wonderful to read.Every literature fan should own a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is a true masterpiece. It's a wonderful trip into the criminal mind. It doesn't spare a thought, it includes everything that the killer is feeling before he commits the crime, after he commits the crime, and while he's committing the crime. It's filled with his conflicting feelings of pride and regret. It displays the theme that someone can't get away with such a terrible crime because there is no escape from their own mind. Raskolnikov could never escape the constant repulsion at himself, and the repulsion of the loved ones around him who knew of his deadly sin.There were some things, though, that put a damper on the reading. I felt like a lot was lost in the translation. While reading I noticed quite a few grammatical errors, and I don't know if that's how it is with most editions of this book, or if it was only mine. It was distracting at times to have to put up with the errors, but it didn't take too much from the book. Once I looked past the errors, I found it an extremely interesting book that is definitely worth investing some time into."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When a book has a visceral effect on the reader, the author must be doing something right. My father complained of actually feeling sick while reading this, and I had a similiar reaction. There is a pervasive darkness here which is little to do with Raskalnikov's crime and punishment and everything to do with the grime and general despair of St. Petersburg. You can almost breath the coal dust in the air; physical and moral squalor taint everything. Even the supposedly good characters live in a state of degredation, and poverty is everwhere. Given this, the pure moral which Dostoevsky seems to try to draw out of it seems a bit ridiculous, and is the main flaw of the book in my eyes. He tries in the last stretch to uplift, but he's shown us too much squalor to make it believable. This book is a bit of a chore to read, I found, given its length and unremitting tone, and while it's clearly the work of a master author, I don't reccomend it unconditonally."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is an interesting novel in which the psyche of a murderer is explored. The beginning of the book is a seesaw inside the murderer's, Raskolnikov, head, between whether or not to commit the crime. The supposed insanity of this leads Raskolnikov to the house where he kills the woman. After the murder, the guilt of the crime is eating at Raskolnikov and even makes him sick. Amongst all of this Raskolnikov has deal with his sister's engagement to a man he does not feel she should marry. The agony of his problems ends with his decisions at the end of the book.This book at times is very slow, but is probably purposely written that way to show what Raskolnikov is going through. The time that is dwelt on a decision making process may bore the reader and may require a break. It strays away from the murder and gets a little into love and other everyday problems. Like most Russian novels there are numerous names that may confuse the reader. There are so many characters that some seem like they do not even need to be mentioned but everyone plays a role in this book. In order to keep track of everything that is going on pay close attention to names or the book may not make complete sense.When it gets to the more interesting parts of the story the book shows its true colors. The reader then understands why he or she just read thirty pages of basically nothing but words. It becomes intensively descriptive, so much that it may be disturbing to some. But the descriptions and the boring parts play into the author's efforts to truly illustrate the mental process of a murderer. Raskolnikov's mind is thoroughly explored and the author seems to have the skill of putting the reader into his shoes. All in all the book gets really slow at times, but the good parts of book out weigh this and make it a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book has everything - a great story, a bit of history, superb character development, etc. And, surprisingly, it's very easy to read despite it's length and origin. Definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a true classic and is a book that is very easy to read. The story is told very well and is fast moving with several interesting subplots. For those of you who dislike the long rants on politics, religion, ect. that some classics contain then fear not because Crime and Punishment is free of those. Again, I found this book to be very easy to read. If you are skeptical about reading The Brothers Karamazov then I would suggest starting out with Crime and Punishment. If you throughly enjoy it then you will be ready for Karamazov which is a longer and harder read (and better in my opinion). Some of my other favorites are Atlas Shrugged, Les Miserable, and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the most excellent book I have ever read. Dostoevsky truly captures the mind of a tortued young man who is going through many things because of his experience. This truly shows the human soul in both forms of good and evil that exsist in all of us. Dostoevsky really understands the human mind"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"this book seems to have given me a fresh shock. I wanna take it to my grave. and on heaven in case I meet the author I'd like to say to him that you did a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"No one will ever write a better book than this one.No one can!I had to read this book in high school and couldn't go past page 80.It seemed to me like the worst and most boring book in the whole world.I didn't understand why I should be interested in a 19th cenetury murderer in ST.Peterburg.A few years ago I decided it was time to read it,if only to see why it is considered such a great literary asset.This time around I understood it!I never thought a writer can be such a great genius or that anyone can create such a perfect creation.I understood that he wasn't speaking only about Russia or about a Russian murderer.He speaks of &quot;man&quot; and humanity.That's why this book is eternal and universal.Some scenes in the book equal the paintings of Rembrandt.I also discovered he can be funny or rather satirical.Dostoevsky is very different in his style of writing than other Russian writers and especialy Tolstoy.He has a kind of corse writing.One feels that he grips life by the b...s.He understands the heart and soul of &quot;man&quot;.I would recommend people to read it after the age of 20,or at least read it again at that age.I liked very much what a reviewer said-&quot;I'm so happy I can read&quot;,it was the first time I too, felt so grateful for being able to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"After reading the other reviews for this book, I felt compelled to put in my two cents - simply because it's a grave misconception, and an entire disservice to the aspirations of the book (if I may be so conceited, bear with me) to state that Raskolnikov is \\"depraved\\", \\"sinful\\", immoral or other such mindlessly aired, banal labels. The whole POINT of this book is enlightenment, specifically enlightenment into the mind of a man moved by his own psychological battle and societal pressure into murdering a perfectly useless old hag. Sorry, but we all know she is - even though that's hardly relevant here; even if she had been angelic, the point is, though Raskolnikov may *seem* animalistic during the murder, etc., he is in fact human - driven by the same motives that drive all humans - a mixture of concern for his family and personal pride - the desire to be great, \\"like Napoleon\\", and to be able to side step and outwit the laws of society and provide for his family, saving his sister from a devastatingly bad marriage of convenience. In some ways Raskolnikov is actually much BETTER than most people - genuinely and passionately concerned for his family with such intensity and altruism that he puts himself through the hell of crime just to spare them misery; in other ways he is insecure - and insecurity about his mental abilities lead him to do devastating things, even resort to murder and mind-games with the police to alleviate his fear of being forever inconsequential. But who among us can say that on a lower level, to a lesser degree, they never felt the same fears, concerns, motives - that in the dark recesses of their minds, when push comes to shove, they would not consider what Raskolnikov does? Any reader who leaves the book thinking it's about a psychotic man who earns redemption, is, forgive me, completely blind to the greater power of the book: the ability it gives us to relate to our fellow man, right down to the criminal within all of us. This book is therefore not ONLY a masterpiece because it is superbly well written, witty, descriptive in a pleasant, non-tedious, eye-opening, humorous way - but also because after reading it you really feel closer to all of humanity, and to the socially restricted basal desires that every honest human can admit to having had. Especially if you substitute the nature of the crime for some lesser crime we all might face, and making exception to its gravity, the psychological struggle is really wonderfully exposed, and it will stick with you forever. A must read, irrespective what the closed-minded say."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I started to read Crime and Punishment for a number of reasons. Firstly, its one of those books that you know is going to come up in some high brow conversation sooner or later. Secondly, you look smart carrying around a 600 page book. Finally, I love Russian literature as a whole (Gogol, Turgenev, Nabokov, not so much Tolstoy...). Mostly, though, I read this to appease my vanity.I was stunned. This book so far surpassed my expectations, it was numbing.To begin with, it has an excellent and original plot. Called the world's greatest detective story, C&P; discloses the murderer (Raskolnikov) on page 10. The rest of the book gives us an incredible look at his motivation; psychological breakdown; acceptance of religion, responsibility, guilt; as well as his interesting philosophical views.Raskolnikov is driven by a Nietzsche-esque philosophy of self-over-society-and-conventional-morality, which leads him to brutally murder an elderly pawnbroker. The act is justified by a \\"greater good\\" rationality (as 1. she is an abusive unloving woman who cheats her clients, and 2. he plans to use her money for good in society). This one intense moment confronts the reader with many difficult questions. Do his ends justify his means? Do any ends justify means so brutal? Can a man ever \\"step over\\" morality? And is the murder rational? If so, is rationality always the highest arbiter of human action?The murder has clear relevence as a political issue as well; Raskolnikov's act parallels the violent revolutionary movements of Dostoevsky's time in many significant ways: Raskolnikov's radical views; his employment of violence against oppressors; (and, when necessary, against innocent bystanders); his intended altruism; etc.All this in the first few pages! The majority of the book that follows is the fall-out from the murder and the resolution of these (and many other) issues inside of Raskolnikov. Its brilliantly done - the intense psychlogical perspectives particularly... keep in mind that Dostoevsky practically invented the internal monologue and stream of consciousness that are now common-place in literature. Equally powerful are Raskolnikov's dreams/hallucinations which are particularly rich in symbolism.Raskolnikov's struggle and ultimate acceptance of responsibility and repentence make an unbelievably strong case for Christian values (which resonated quite strongly even with an agnostic like myself).All in all, READ THIS BOOK. Not just because you'll look and sound smarter (which you will be), but because it is truly unique and amazing story of great moral/philosophical depth."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Review of Crime and Punishment By a Colorado readerA pale - faced man stares at a door that marks his destiny. Beads of sweat run down his sunken face. His fate sealed, he nervously looks at the old woman before him, his eyes darting across the room, barley able to hold the cruel stare of the elderly pawnbroker. Heart pounding, he resists the urge to cry out in terror, and run from the shrewd old woman, but his mind is set. He cannot return, he has gone too far to stop now, and must carry out his desperation induced crime. Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment revolves around a poor man struggling to survive in St. Petersburg, Russia. Raskolnikov, the main character, is stricken with both poverty and sickness. It's these determining factors that drive him into murdering a wealthy pawnbroker. Dostoevsky does a masterful job in describing the intense mental anguish that the protagonist goes through both before and after committing the act. He uses symbolism throughout the novel to help further this description of Raskolnikov's suffering, such as the intense fever he suffers that begins just prior the murder, peaks during the act, and continues for days afterwards. This fever also plays a major role in how those characters around him react to him after the crime. Nearly everyone around him is sympathetic towards him, and try to help, but Raskolnikov view himself as being superior to these others, and so rejects any form of charity offered to him. This is another one of Dostoevsky's commentaries on life. He believes that criminals who aren't used to committing crimes act in generally the same manner as Raskolnikov does. They slowly but surely isolate themselves socially, simply because of the fact that all they can think about is the crime itself. This is true of the main character, but in later chapters he tries to correct this after meeting a prostitute that he views to be a victim of situation, much as he seems to view himself. Now of course, this is not a terribly easy book to read, as most of the names are in Russian, and are at times hard to keep track of. Another aspect of the novel, is that at times, it can get rather dry and slow, but with patience it inevitably gets better, and is masterfully written to delve deep into the psychological aspects of punishment that are not as readily visible."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Listen carefully: when you read a work translated, the translator makes a big difference. Constance Garnett is a fine translator, but she tends to literally translate (not literal as in a machine translation, but rather, so no word is lost). This tends to make the book wordy and grates on many people's nerves (not just mine--read the other reviews here)CAVEAT EMPTOR. You have been warned. A better, more modern translator might be: Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.And as they say in Russian: &quot;If you don't believe it, take it as a fairy tale&quot; (translated)."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Welcome to the glittering world of dyschronic post-modernist criticism, which has enabled me to recognize that 'Crime and Punishment', published in 1866, was written as a prescient refutation of the Objectivist philosophy expressed in Ayn Rand's novels 'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged'. Without the wonders of dyschronicity, we'd have to mention that 'Atlas Shrugged' wasn't published until 1957 and Ayn Rand wasn't born until 1905. However, surely the fact that Dostoyevsky and Rand died almost exactly 100 years apart will be recognized as a signifier.The most cogent advocate of Randian Objectivism in 'C&P;' is the scurvy Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, the suitor for Dunya's hand, who speaks for himself in his first face-to-face encounter with Raskolnikov: \\"Love yourself before all others,\\" he says, \\" for everything in the world is founded on self-interest. If you love only yourself, you will conduct your enterprises in a proper manner...\\" and by implication, good things will trickle down to the rest of us. As the most single-minded Objectivist, please note, Luzhin is the only character in the novel who is unambiguously a swine. Even the erratic, half-crazy Svidrigailov falls short of perfect obedience to Randian morality, compromising the order of things by last-minute acts of charity.The scene in the tavern, early in the novel, when Raskolnikov overhears other young 'intellectuals' discussing the logic of justifying a 'crime' by weighing it against the heroic benefits that may result from its success - to whit, the murder of the old-lady usurer in order to gain the capital to achieve a great destiny, the very crime Raskolnikov has been meditating - is not only a parallel to scenes in Rand's work, but it is, I swear, exactly word-for-word a transcript of a discussion I heard in a Harvard dining hall in 1963 between David Friedman (the anarcho-capitalist son of Milton Friedman) and some friends, and that conversation, believe it or not, was repeated verbatim at a drinking session in the Bohemian Grove in 1982, the speakers being Dick Cheney and acquaintances. Remarkable, I'd say! The convergence of libertarianism and neo-liberalism (aka neo-conservatism) is to be found in Ayn Rand.Hostile as Raskolnikov is the the scurrilous Luzhin, his own ethical premises, as expressed in the article he had written months before the action of the novel, are also pure Objectivism. \\"...an extraordinary person has a right... not an official right of course, but a private one, to allow his conscience to step across certain obstacles, and then only if the execution of his idea, which may be the salvation of all mankind, requires it.\\" For the benefit of anyone who hasn't actually read 'Crime and Punishment', the entire 700 page novel is constructed to teach Raskolnikov the error of his assumptions, so that by the time he reaches Siberia he can accept the humble Sonya's notions of suffering and redemption. Yes, readers, I warn you that Dostoyevsky's answer to Objectivism, and to proto-communism for that matter, is... oh, you'd best read it for yourself.One thing I didn't notice, the first time I read C&P; some 50 years ago, was how entertaining it is. That's right, entertaining! What a gallery of vivid characters! What a sensory feast of description, albeit chiefly description of filth, poverty, and depravity! What scorching, sardonic wit with which the principal characters taunt each other! Long and dark it is, but C&P; is also an elegantly constructed fiction, a book that was immediately 'popular' and has deservedly stayed popular. Why, Ayn Rand herself declared it to be one of the novels that most influenced her, though that can be taken as evidence that Ms. Rand wasn't a particularly insightful reader. The only portion of the novel which fails, IMHO, is the epilogue, and I have an explanation for the problem; the Tsarist secret police compelled Dostoyevsky's editor to falsify a semi-happy ending in epilogue format as a condition for allowing the publication of such a dire portrayal of Russian life.Compare C&P;, if you will, with English novels of the mid 19th Century - Dickens, Trollope, Eliot, Gaskell. The English are all about manners and mores. The Russia of C&P; was a world of philosophical and social ferment, far more 'modern' in its intellectual daring. I'm not sure the average Anglo-American reader has caught up yet."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"After reading this book, it is very clear to me why Dostoevsky was one of the most influential writers ever. Nietzsche was in love with him, and valued his insight into the psychology of human nature. Even though I read a translation, it was still a work of brilliance. I can only imagine how great the original is."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is a literal masterpiece of man's search for the self. He uses Existentialist theories to motivate Raskolnikov to commit the &quot;perfect murder&quot;. What makes this work awesome, is the use of his personal writing. The use of language in this novel is informal, yet captivating. The reader has trouble putting this book down as the life of Raskolnikov escalates down a spiral of insanity and loneliness. The realization of his mistakes takes a toll on his well being and he must confess his crime of murder before he loses all hope. The moral issues in this novel are ones of great proportion. Man cannot survive completely alone, and he cannot instill his will over others, when he has nothing left to will, he is nothing, and death is the suitable solution. Raskolnikov almost comes to this conclusion, but a woman gives him hope. Without the support from Sonia, he would have perished. One of Dostoevsky's aims for this novel was disproving the theories of Nietzsche and Hegel in their philosophy of the Uber man. Both believed that man can become extraordinary through their will and actions, and are therefore above the law of man. However, no man is above the law, and Dostoevsky uses Raskolnikov to prove that theory, as Raskolnikov's life becomes more painful to endure. In the end, his confession is his salvation, and once again, he enters the world of humanity."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You plan a crime. It is solely of your design. The method. The place. The victim. Everything is your calculation. It is your conscious mind that has plotted the deed. It is your voluntary actions which carry it out. Every aspect of the crime belongs to you. It is very much a part of who you are. Your identity. Your past. Your future.Do you not deserve credit for its brilliance? For its success? But also for its failure? For its punishment? And the suffering that follows?These are the existential questions facing the protagonist Raskolnikov in Dostoyevsky's classic work. Set against 18th Century St. Petersburg -- a time when poverty and blind religious faith created a recipe for scandalous social acceptance of depraved living conditions and suffering of many. All of this accentuates Raskolnikov's own condition. A brilliant law student, he himself is very poor. Living in shabby quarters, he rarely eats. In this setting, Raskolnikov comes to a final decision (or delusion?) -- to prove his superiority through a heinous and horrible crime.This is not your typical crime novel thriller. Not in the least. The suspense comes not through the cliched question of \\"Whodunnit?\\", but through Dostoyevsky's own brilliant grasp of human psychology. Once the deed is done (early on) the story shifts to the events following the bloody crime. Slowly, Raskolnikov's motives, desires and philosophical views become clear. We see him challenge the cynical and hollow Looshin for the benefit of his sister. We see him confront the police and magistrates directly with his alleged guilt. But all the while, the depravity of Raskolnikov's living condition and unpredictable emotions and actions render all of these \\"conscious\\" intentions suspect. Like Gregor Samsa in Kafka's Metamorphosis, our privileged access to Raskolnikov's thoughts perhaps betray a diseased mind. A confused consciousness. A man no longer the agent of his actions.These circumstances both consciously and subconsciously drive Raskolnikov to question his own actions and state of mind. In a sense, he grasps for straws as his past actions becomes blurred. And this becomes his struggle -- the existential anxiety of losing control over the ability to shape his destiny. Dostoyevsky responds with a powerful challenge, with Raskolnikov trading freedom for responsibility and suffering and, ultimately, salvation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky will forever cause high school children to groan in discomfort. I did, until I was older and picked this book up on my own. The style is difficult to trudge through at first, I think mostly because it does not translate too easily into comfortable American slang. But you do get used to it, and the story and theme are well worth the effort. Now, I have been told by friends that Crime and Punishment is not Dostoevsky's best work. If this is true, I will be delighted to read his others. This story, like The Bell Jar and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, may appeal to those who have difficulty in social situations. I identified with the character's distaste for company, even though he knew that he was not healthy. I should caution, however, that this book was so well written, that I actually felt my mood turn dour as soon as I picked it up. It isn't for bedtime reading, unless you like dark, shadowy dreams of loneliness and despair. Read on a dark stormy night with a fire going and leave the rest of the room plunged in shadows. Indulge your less comfortable side!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Are some people superior to other people? Dostoevsky's protagonist, Raskolnikov, believes so. In fact, Raskolnikov believes that he is one of these superior people, and he further believes that his superiority frees him from the laws that govern his weak and inferior fellows. Raskolnikov tests the strength of his belief by relieving an &quot;inferior&quot; human being of her life and money.This is the point where the real story begins.Crime and Punishment is a brilliant story of choices and consequences, of taking an idea to its extreme and seeing what happens on the other side. People who believe they are superior to others would do well to read this book and explore the ultimate meaning of such a position.I read Crime and Punishment once every five years just to balance my heart and mind. I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you aren't in for a long cognitive adventure, then don't read this book. I wouldn't reccomend reading it by the pool or lying on the beach with a boombox at your back. Chances are though, if you are even looking up this review, that isn't the type of reader you are. If you are willing to advance the effort, you will be duly rewarded with this novel. True, I found some parts to be slow and a little over done, but for a book written in the late 1800's to still be appreciated in 2002?! That is truly amazing. It transends time, culture, race, religion, sex... despite the fact that it was written so long ago, if you try to read it, you will enjoy this novel. I promise.It starts in the sity of St. Petersburg, it starts with our young protragonist with a Napolean complex, hungry, alone and ashamed. He comes up with a scenerio he doesn't think himself capable of, and though it may not be necessary for his survival, it certainly could potentially help him, and his family. More than anything, to prove himself to himself he commits the crime, despite the fact that he doesn't really want to in the first place. Then, like a slap in the face of his own geniusness, he finds himself betrayed by his own worst enemy, his conscience. It is ironic that it is so easy for our young hero to accept the fact that he is a good person that made mistakes, when it is so easy for him to accept this trait in others (enter the drunk that prostitues his daughter). Unlike most of society (then or now) Rasko (my pet name for him as the names in this novel got a bit out of hand) held the amazing characteristic of being able to see through people and realize that some of us who look bad to others, are really good at heart and some that look good to society, are real harmful people underneath.Too bad he couldn't apply this logic to the mirror.This is a psychological thriller that doesn't have a thrilling plot, a romance novel with no love, a soliliquy with no song. This book basicallly encompasses everything it wasn't. It explores the mind of a criminal and demonstrates the philosophy that every man is inherently good, even those that do bad things. These bad things are fed with some sort of explanation, we just have to listen for it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Having just read the autobiographical A Moveable Feast in which Hemingway discusses Dostoevsky(I wish they would decide upon a definite spelling) and notes how Dostoevsky is undeniably great, however one can only read his works once due to the utterly grave and morose manner in which they inevitably are written. I am in concurrence with this having just finished Crime and Punishment. While I highly recommend this seminal and profound work to all, as Raskolnikov would say, extraordinary individuals outside of the lowly laboring class of the abysmally inept proletariat, I must say that I do not plan on rereading it anytime in the near future.The dark and morbid cover of the book omniously more than sets the foreboding tone of this deep look into the morose psyche of a tainted and morally depraved intellectual. The ubiquitous gloom and pervading despair permeate throughout Crime and Punishment as we witness the pestilence endured in St. Petersburg in the 19th Century. The continuous coughing of blood by the perpetually sick, the heavy vodka drinking, the gloom of poverty, the virtual starvation of many, the using of \\"the yellow passport\\" by Sonia solely in order to maintain sustenance for her family, as well as the remorseless murder of the pawnbroker and Lizveta all contribute to the dissolute debauchery and moral depravity exuded by Dostoevsky.Is it jusifiable to commit heinous acts on morally corrpt individuals for the betterment of society? Does the despicable means of murder of the dirty, old pawnbroker justify the taking of rubles and jewelry to distribute to those less fortunate who are of good moral standing? Raskolnikov adheres to this belief using reason over conscience thinking great men such as Napoleon are allowed to overstep the laws of man for the betterment of society. After the murders, Raskolnikov finds himself \\"trapped in dreary solitude from which there was no escape.\\" It is refreshingly profound, and altogether surprising, when Raskolnikov undergoes an epiphany of sorts and finally feels genuine and unadulterated remorse while banished in Siberia. While very dark and macabre, Crime and Punishment comes as a highly recommended, albeit a highly provocative and involving work. Be prepared to put on your proverbial thinking cap, so to speak. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"What can I add to 635 reviews (as I write)? I think this book is fascinating because of all the topic it covers. Like the OJ trial, it is about many important interconnected things and those things remain important today, even though this book was originally published in 1865.Sure, it has a lot about crime and punishment. But also insanity and temporary insanity, the latter a legal plea that could be entered in Russia of the mid-1800's. It's about guilt and conscience, long before Freud. In fact, this book was written at a time when psychological theories were coming into vogue. It's about false confessions. It's about poverty and social class and people who rise above their class and people who fall from the class they were born into. It's about the wild dreams and the follies of youth.There is also mention of many social theories that were in vogue at that time, so, for example, if you want to, you can click on Wikipedia to find out about \\"Fourier's system\\" and his phalansteres. There is attempted rape, blackmail, child labor, child prostitution, child marriage and child molestation. There is discussion of marrying for money. There are ethnic tensions between Russians and the Germans of St. Petersburg. Should you give to charity or should you give to change the conditions that caused the poverty? Like me, you may have thought that was a modern idea, but here it is, laid out in 1865. There's a lot about alcoholism. Stir in a cat-and-mouse detective and a bit of Christian redemption. No wonder this is a classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Amazon says this Blackstone Audio version, available on CD and from Audible, is the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation.

I was surprised by how quickly the story came to the crime act, as the summary suggested there was a lot of planning of the \\"perfect crime\\", when in actuality he spent much more time agonizing over the crime than planning the crime. I found the police chief's character to be especially interesting, and the repartee between the two at the end really sealed the story as delightful."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Those who read CRIME AND PUNISHMENT by Dostoevsky often approach it thinking that it is standard detective story, sort of a Russian Sherlock Holmes. What they discover almost from the first is that the identity of the criminal is revealed, so this is not a novel of suspense or of a brilliant police detective. The focus they further learn is not on the \\"crime\\" of the title, nor is is very much on the \\"punishment\\" either. Instead, in the endless self-rationalizations of the murderer-protagonist Raskolnikov, they learn Dostoevski squarely places dramatic interest on an uneasy stasis between Raskolnikov's motive for the killing of two women and his need to suffer as atonement for those killings.In order to draw the reader into the mind and plot, Dostoevski needed to ensure the primacy of his theme of the need for obsessive suffering. He accomplishes this by centering the story on the murder of the two women. Everything in the story either leads up to or follows it. The reader quickly learns a great deal of information so that by the end of the first few chapters, he has placed himself in the shoes and the mind of Raskolnikov. Ironically, although Raskolnikov tells the reader that his motivation was no more than to see if he could place himself so godlike above the law that he not fear the consequences of that law, the reader learns, slowly and painfully as does Raskolnikov, that the real motivation is not what he tells himself so bluntly. Does Raskolnikov kill for the money? To eliminate what he sees as social parasites that society would benefit from in their removal? Or can there be other reasons, hidden even from him? Complicating his constant self-examination as to motive lay Dostoevski himself. As a writer, Dostoevski was concerned for the salvation of the Russian soul, one that he saw as threatened by a western reliance on rational pragmatism that, in criminal matters in any case, required a convincing and single rationale that could totally explain and explicate any crime. Such an approach might work in Western democracies, but the Russian soul needed a call for order and justice that transcended logic and reason. This call was historically rooted in \\"rodina,\\" an almost mystical love for the Russian motherland. And for one to gain this heightened sense of unity with Russian soil and Russian values, one had to suffer to expiate crime. Thus the need for Raskolnikov not only to suffer, but first he had to earn the right to suffer. The crime is then seen as less important than the punishment, both of which are ultimately weighed as still less important than any needed suffering. When Raskolnikov can endure no further suffering, he confesses, and his confession is proper expiation for his crime. His punishment of a lengthy prison term in Siberia is almost anti-climactic. He will emerge from prison a man who has learned that the act of sin can lead the way to redemption for that sin but only if one pays the price before the jury returns with a verdict. In CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, Dostoevski makes this point as starkly as anyone else has."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book in one sitting and thought I'd brag about it to a wide-scale audience"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Hi everyone.....I need help I have a book report due and I need to know pages in the book.

My friend is a big fan of Russian literature. With a lot of experience reading all sorts of literature, and a little bit of experience reading things by Russian authors, I took the plunge. I don't know the background on Constance Garnett's ability to translate Russian to English, but she is a nonstarter in my book.This is quite possibly one of the most horrible books I have ever opened. I have tried at least ten different times over the past year to read it and under different conditions, but it is just plain painful to read. The dialogue is choppy and irritating. The actions of the characters are not very believable, and I felt no compassion for any of the people. I personally wished bad things upon each and every one of them -- not because of their character, but because how horribly written the book was. I am quitting now after reading only two-thirds of it novel.I wish I could resurrect Lermontov and have him write another book so I could enjoy a proper Russian author.In about one hour, I am going to walk down to the beach and throw this book into the Red Sea.I am in Africa and this is the right thing to do.I hope \\"The Brothers Karamoz\\" isn't this bad, because I own it too."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"'Crime and Punishment' has it all...murder, betrayal, perversion, a tortured protagonist, love, rebirth, and passion. It tells the tale of a man who commits spiritual suicide through a heinous act, and his agonizing journey towards redemption. It is masterfully crafted, every seemingly insignificant detail has untold repercussions on the story and its characters. For example, the contrast between Raskolnikov and his love interest, the beautiful Sonya. While he is an arrogant yet respected student, she is a spiritual woman forced into prostitution by circumstance. The world shuns her for her outward sin, while it is Raskolnikov they should cast out...while he is seemingly respectable, his soul is as vile as Sonya's sheets. The greatest difficulty I had reading this book was keeping track of the names. Each character has at least three different names, and they're all used randomly and without warning. Once you get the hang of it, however, it is not an obstacle. While 'Crime and Punishment' is an incredibly difficult read, it is the most satisfying book I have ever experienced. Its brilliant look into the interplay of humans and their failings combined with its subtle and often disturbing message of hope makes this a thorougly remarkable work, one not to be passed up. This has become my favorite book, I hope it becomes yours as well."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first started reading this novel when I was 12 years old. I only got through the first 50 or so pages before putting the book down. Now, another 12 years down the line, I picked it up again, and this time I didn't let go.Fyodor Dostoevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is simply one of - if not *the* best novel I have ever read. Dostoevsky is the master of portraying characters in a believable way; when you're reading the book you feel as though you are in the room with Rodja, Dunja, Razumichin and Luzjin. It's like stepping into a time-machine set for pre-revolution Russia.The plot revolves around Rodion &quot;Rodja&quot; Romanovitj Raskolnikov, a poor ex-student who murders an old woman in the belief that he's doing it for the good of man. This happens in the first part of the book; in the rest of the book we follow Rodja in his feverish nightmare, walking the streets of Petersburg.The book is interesting not only because of it's great entertainment value, but even more so because of the philosophical questions it asks. The late great Ayn Rand was also a master of this type of novel. With the exception of &quot;Crime and Punsihment,&quot; the only novel I have read where you really feel that the characters are so real is Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Editorial reviews on the current page (Crime and Punishment [Kindle Edition]) indicate that it's the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation. In fact, it's a translation by Constance Garnett."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the story of Raskolnikov , a young student in Petersburg who commits a double murder,Dostoevsky explores the themes of guilt and redemption. Raskolnikov is driven to the point of madness by his awareness of what he's done and his expectation that he will be exposed at any moment.As he falls deeper into his delusional state the novel's suspense is created by the anticipation of his being caught. He is suspected by a detective who uses very subtle techniques(think - Columbo) to slowly confirm his suspicion and the interaction between the two of them provide some of the more tense and poignant moments in the book.There are many other well realized characters in the novel including Raskonikov's mother and sister, his close friend and a young poverty stricken girl who turns to prostitution out of desperation.Crime and Punishment is a challenging novel and as with much 19th century literature it is extraordinarily detailed in Dostoevsky's descriptions of both characters and settings. I was drawn in and wanted to finish this but I must admit there were a few sections where I almost set it aside.Persistance paid off because I consider this a very rewarding read and time well spent."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I am 17 and for a first time reader of this book, I was surprised byt the alteration in vocabulary that has taken place sine the 1880's. I enjoyed the story very much and it was only dull if you have a lazy mind. The intensity of the thought process that Fyodor D. goes into depth with is so amazing and I just love it. This novel is helpful also in the understanding of your own conscience and reminds you how you need to listen to it or you will start a punishment that can lead one to insanity."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky's magnum opus is filled with literary gold. It abounds with deep philosophy and insightful psychology. Really, he only seems existentialist, and spends most of the novel disproving his protagonist's motivating theory. The philosophy is interesting, but moreso the way he refutes it. He has a way of hitting his readers over the head with Jesus--he was devoutly religious--yet he never offends even the most questioning atheists, although the ending is a bit of a let-down. His protagonist is a murderer, his Christ figure is a whore, and his descriptions are so vivid that one can literally smell the putrescence of St. Petersburg leaking from the pages. Or perhaps I had an overused copy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The central figure of this expansive work, Raskolnikov, is an impoverished student - largely of his own making. As the book opens we find him occupied with a thought - an &quot;idea&quot;. During the development we realize that the idea is a murder of an old woman who Raskolnikov sees as evil.The plot is very simple. Raskolnikov murders the woman, and her step-daughter who has the misfortune to walk in at the wrong time, he makes a botched search for money and escapes without anyone seeing him. The remainder of the book involves his attempts, or lack thereof, to prevent the truth from being discovered.This novel is not about plot, though. It is about Raskolnikov's mind - specifically why he committed the murder and his nagging conscience that won't seem to let him get away with it. As with other 19th century Russian novels we also get a commentary on the times, political arguments and many sub-plots intertwined. All of this is handled masterfully.The characters are what gives this novel such depth. At first glance some of the characters may appear to be too pat - the lazy student, the alcoholic, the prostitute, the bumbling policeman, etc. But all of Dostoevsky's characters are imbued with such life, such vigor that they leap off the page and stay in their minds.And Raskolnikov's thoughts stay with us too - we really do wonder about whether murder can ever be right, whether people can be above the law and so on. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Truly one of the greatest stories ever told, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment is a testament to the flaws of human nature. Crime and Punishment follows one of the most accurately human characters I have ever read of, Rodion Raskolnikov, through his trials and tribulations after committing a murder. Nearly everything about this novel is intriguing and the book has very few flaws.Rodion Raskolnikov is a character I can absolutely relate to. His character is so natural, so real, more so than characters in the books I read. Raskolnikov commits his murder in hopes of becoming something greater, which is a flaw that he may never overcome. His reasoning in the murder is flawed and his hopes for the future are flawed as well. In his desire to become a more powerful human, such as his hero Napoleon, he damns himself to the wretched wasteland of Siberia. He never repents for killing the old woman, who is agreeably a shady character. Raskolnikov does fear he went to far in killing the kindly, yet gullible, Lizeveta, whom he never meant to attack. The emotions described in the story by all of the characters, but especially Raskolnikov, are all feelings I myself have felt. His desire for forgiveness, understanding, vindication, and power are genuine human emotions. His desire to share his pain with another, while at the same time trying to not cause anyone close to him pain, causes him to fall deeper into insanity and sickness. In the end, Raskolnikov realizes that he could never be a Napoleon, but a rather ordinary man.The only fault of this book, in my eyes, is the long-winded thought processes of the characters. Perhaps it is only the translation, but the book goes into the deepest details in explaining the most trivial actions. It is not boring, per say, but it does make the book move much more slowly. Also, possibly again due to the translation, people seem to stare at each other for quite a while. I do not profess to have a great knowledge of nineteenth century Russia, but I find it hard to believe people would just stare at each other for four, five, and ten minutes at a time without speaking, then go on as if it never happened.The psychology in this book is also very captivating. The paranoia experienced by Raskolnikov at the hands of Porfiry Petrovich, Razumihin knowing his friend so well, yet never realizing the truth until much later on in the book, Svidrigailov's apparent monomania over Avdotya Raskolnikov, and the unexpected psychological attack on Zametov by Raskolnikov are only a few of the great instances where thought, rather than action, tell the story.Crime and Punishment, overall, is one of the best literary classics I have ever read. The characters are some of the easiest to relate to and the experiences they are forced to encounter force the reader to reflect on human nature and the flaws therein."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Nietzsche, a man who was always first to annihilate other writers and thinkers, bestowed lavish praise on Dostoevsky, &quot;that profound human being.&quot; But seemingly contrary to Nietzsche, Crime and Punishment illustrates the fallacies of nihilism. The main character Raskolnikov is obsessed with Nietzsche's &quot;Superman&quot; theory, that he is beyond all morals like great men, a la Napoleon. To prove this, he sets out to murder an old, disgusting pawnbroker who is &quot;past all usefullness and should have died long ago.&quot; After he accomplishes the grisly deed the novel illustrates his conflict between his rationalizations and his conscience, and the corresponding madness that results. Finally, Raskolnikov is redeemed by love and faith, evincing the Russian Christianity that pervades Russian literature. He realized that his murder was just the disgusting attempt to prove his superiority, when in reality he wasn't such a man. His rational and nihilistic viewpoints at the beginning allowed him to rationalize the murder. The redemption of faith illustrates the point &quot;If God doesn't exist then everything is permitted.&quot; To be fair to Nietzsche, he was looking for life-affirmation after removing all certainty of morality and truth, a near impossible task. He was hardly settling for nihilism, even if some of his work appears to be just that. And his Superman theory was probably more in response to someone like Jesus, who besides annihilating the corrupt values and beliefs of his time, creates something that is superior. Dostoevsky is responding to someone who interprets Nietzsche's writings falsely. On the novel, the writing is absolutely superb and clearly reflects the troubled and frantic state of a madman or someone undergoing physchological trauma. The themes are, of course, profound. A thoroughly brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I've lived some 40+ years successfully avoiding all the lengthy Russian novels because I feared they'd either put me to sleep, or generate headaches. Upon completing Crime and Punishment, given to me by a colleague, I'm really annoyed for depriving myself from enjoying such a literary classic.Crime and Punishment is, as you would expect, a long-ish and wordy novel. And the character's names, and nicknames, are confusing to me (a non-Russian). But the overall murder story is very absorbing, as are the tangential subplots. This is NOT a murder mystery; the reader knows who committed the crime central to the story. However its deep psychological analysis as to why the crime was committed and how it affects the criminal afterwards is extremely well done (without being preachy).Crime and Punishment, while somewhat cumbersome, is NOT a difficult read. I heartily recommend those who are fans of popular crime novels (eg, John Grisham novels) should &quot;move up&quot; and give it a try. It's a very rich read. ...and you'll be able to impress your friends on telling them you read it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Definitely, this is the best book I have read so far. It is an excellent psychological analysis of the human being. If you have not read this book. Buy it, it's worth the money and time"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"One should probably read this great novel TWICE to catch all the nuances. Like his other major works, this masterpiece by Dostoevsky drives home two central, inter-related themes: (a) that ideas (and ideology) have consequences; and (b) that these can be deadlier than any other force on earth.For sheer depth and profundity, probably nothing can match the parable of The Grand Inquisitor, in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, but there's one line in C&amp;P that immediately struck me as one of the greatest single sentences in all the world's literature, quintessentially pregnant with meaning. The detective, Porfiry Petrovich, who knows that Raskolnikov is the murderer, doesn't arrest him, playing a sort of cat-and-mouse game. Porfiry rightly suspects that this was a political (ideological) crime, not a typical one, and knows that his triumph would be much greater if he forces Raskolnikov to ADMIT not just the error of his act, but the error of his thinking. This sentence varies considerably from translation to translation, but basically it is (Porfiry to Raskolnikov): &quot;You know, it's just as well you only killed the old woman. Because if you'd invented another THEORY, that would have been a thousand times MORE hideous.&quot; The events of our century have well borne out this prophecy.The other superb part of this novel is when Raskolnikov's friend Razmuihin is shocked to hear that Raskolnikov's journal article had suggested that &quot;superior&quot; men, like Napoleon, create their own moral codes and are not bound by traditional ones. (Woody Allen's film BULLETS OVER BROADWAY also provided a good satire of this ominous idea: an artist &quot;creates his own moral universe.&quot; And, as in C&amp;P, this led to a killing.) What shocks Razmuihin the most is that wanton killing and terror could be justified PRECISELY IN THE NAME OF MORALITY.Have we not seen enough of this already, in its most terrible aspects? The point is: such theories are still boiling in the pot, and we may not have heard the last of them."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have read all the books that Dostojevski wrote and I really do love them all.

It has everything, philosophy, character development, a rich language, and a very interesting story.The writer explores the psychology of a criminal mind, his feeling, the way he thinks and how later he repents about the crime.Raskolnikov a very poor law student away from school for financial reasons decides to commit a crime. Dostoyevsky does a very good job in developing his caracter. In the beggining Raskolnikov thinks that in the world are two kind of people. The ordinary people and the extraordinary. The latest are the kind of people that have the &quot;right&quot; to commit crimes in order to walk forward, grow in ther career or do something that is very good for the society, like Napoleon etc. The ordinary people dont have the right to commit crimes they are under the law. He thinks that commiting this crime will serve to the society, but later on as the story goes we see Raskolnikov change. This by several factors, his love for Sonia, his mother and Sister.We see some other characters in the novels that aren't criminals like Luzhin but we dont have any sympathy for them.In the end Raskolnikov change his mind, He starts to understand that he was not &quot;Napoleon&quot; or extraordinary and in order to be releaved and start a new life he needs to be &quot;Punished&quot;.Very good book I would suggest everybody to read it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a little bit heavy book as a size,but the expereance is unforgettable.All caracters in the book are strange and in the same time AWFULLY real.Every heroe has his own micro world.An amazing caracter gallery!!!I have seen the movie version of Hallmark.What a shame!!!One of the greatest books of all times presented like a stupid soap opera."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is one of my favorite novels. The psychological developments of the main character are rich. I think the question of the novel applies to any era governed by the rule of law: If one commits a crime that kills or utterly injures another thinking that the eventual benefits of the crime outweigh the consequences of the injuries of the crime, then one must still cope with knowing one has stepped outside the path of being a modern human; that is, the book's premise is that we are all connected and our conscience may or may not (I don't want to entirely give away the books plot) be able to cope with stepping on the roots of our common human experience. Exceptional read and well-worth buying, even if to simply say you have a penchant for Russian novels."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This books is a glorious Example of Human Psychology.It is always very difficult to depict or bring forth a human mind but Dostoevsky's illustration has been marvelous"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is incredibly well-written. Throughout the book, it was tough for me to decide whether or not I liked Raskolnikov, and I realized this was because he has two personalities. At times, Raskolnikov is kind, like Sonia and other times, he is a dark, intellectual, like Svidrigailov. It was interesting to see a part of Raskolnikov die when he committed the murders, but then come back to life with the help of Sonia. This is just like the story of Lazarus read by Sonia. Overall, this is a great novel that you have to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If there are books that are above criticism this one should be one of them. Very well written. It mesmerizes you and makes you like the main hero, the young Raskolnikov who commits the murder out of bilief in his superiority but cannot live up to his expectations afterwards. There are very deep psychological insights as well as philosophical and social comments throughout. The plot is interesting too, with many twists and turns. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Internal conflict is a key element in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment, because Raskolnikov's actions occur as results of his inner frustrations. Raskolnikov's harsh life effects his ability to think rationally. During a conversation with one of his companions he says, \\"It all went according to theory... Get to the consequences of what you've just been preaching, and it will turn out that one can go around putting a knife in people\\" (151). In this conversation, Raskolnikov misinterprets his friend's theory and clues the reader of his sickness. Most things are circled around death after Raskolnikov kills the two ladies. In his first killing he feels cornered and left with no other choice. Raskolnikov's growing sickness makes him obsessed with detail. The narrator explains his physical condition saying, \\"However, it was not that he was totally unconcious during the whole time of his illness: it was a feverish condition, with moments of delirium and semi-awareness. Afterwards he remembered a great deal\\" (117). The narrator reflects his inner sickness with his outer one in the story. It is almost as if he is in a dream, seeing what he is doing but not stopping himself. He does not realize the sverity of his actions until the process is over. Raskolnikov's life goes by in a drunken haze. What happens around you affects you in ways you do not realize. Dostoevsky's story displays how outer elements of a person's life can change their thought process and lead them to insanity."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"For those not versed in the peculiarities of Russian cultural history in juxtaposition to western European, this book is educative in one great respect: it lays bear the importance in that history of the idea in relation to actions.For those of steely nervous composition Crime and Punishment is an absolute must. For the more mousy, perhaps a little harrowing. Just as it is for the principle protaganist, who declares in the first pages that he feels as though his clothing has been caught in the wheels of a machine and he is being dragged inexorably into it, so it is for the reader. It will definately leave nobody indifferent.In it we are taken for a wrenching roller coaster ride over a complex moral landscape by its hero, Raskolnikov, who sets out to divest himself of what he sees as his own shortcomings by enacting a very simple idea. In the spirit of his pre-revolutionary times he converts confining moral tenets into a simplified mathematics. The equation is simple: if he murders one aged, miscreant and odious moneylender, he may release at least 2 virtuous people from impending or actual misery. No one will regret the passing of the old hag; it would be an almost universal shame should the virtuous not be released.The murder occurs within the first few chapters. Consequently the bulk and substance of the book is concerned with the plight of the hero after he has forced himself to conclude the deed. Will he or won't (turn himself in) he is the fevered question, which accompanies the reader from the completion of the crime up to the resolution. And it is the threads of this gruesome personal battle which provide the fabric of the book. Believe me, you empathic readers will be yearning for both conclusions in turns. It is interesting to note that the crime goes wrong and Raskolnikov murders not just the old hag. The second murder is of an 'innocent'. It is, though, hardly mentioned during the torturous journey of the murderer. The real 'trans-gression', a suitably accurate translation of the Russian word for crime used in the title - 'pre-stuplenie' - is the carrying out of an idea calculated to free the perpetrator from his wretched existence. As the great French philosopher said: nothing presents less of an obstacle than the perfecting of the the theoretical. Beware all ye who would confuse theory for practice. Existentialism is fine for the university student, but putting it into practice can prove intolerably lonesome for all but the psycopath. Psycopaths, by the way - the Napoleons referred to in the book - do not spend their time pontificating over the justifiability of what they do.I have read this book 6 times. In English, Russian, and for some reason even in German. I assume that I shall continue periodically reading it. I have visited the places in St. Petersburg in Russia where everything takes place (they are all real and concur exactly with the text). It has a heavyweight claim to being the greatest novel ever written. In my opinon this is because it functions brilliantly on any and all of its various levels. Whether examined as the patron of the 'psychological' novels, looked at in its historico-political context, or taken as a straight thriller, this book can bearly fail to exite immense empathy and emotion in any keen book reader. Read it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevksy marvelously illustrates the effect that guilt has on the human mind. Raskolnikov, an idealist and impoverished youth, finds himself committing a murder to help his people, but he is slowly transformed, along with his social theories. The unexplainable guilt gnaws at him until he changes his mind about his motives, his morals, and his faith. He realizes that social and economic change do not happen through murder, but through charity and hard work, which he learns through helping the prostitute daugher of a drunkard, as well as his own poor family. He accepts religion and God, as a way to repent and make his life more meaningful, and slowly he drives himself toward a confession..... This is a classic and outstanding book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the classic psychological novel of our time! Dostoevsky examines every inch of the human mind at its most horrific moment. It will take a good hour before you are fully taken in by the story. Once you are there - you anxiously await the outcome. At the end - you will probably feel more sympathy for the murderer than the murdered, because the author gave us so much insight into the criminal mind. Dostoevsky made us believe that the main character could even be you or I."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I went into this with an open mind. I had heard of the author, of course, but never expected to read anything of his. Someone left a copy lying around. I grabbed it to have something to read while I soaked in a hot bath. The bath turned cold and I was still reading.I'm not sophisticated enough to expound on the deeper meaning or the underlying philosophy. For me the book was simply a highly entertaining read. I couldn't put it down, as they say. I didn't want it to finish. The author created a world in which you could fully \\"immerse\\" yourself. Good reading for the bath."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I feel Alex Jennings is a very good reader. He often imitates the characters he reads as though he were several different people. This helps to imagine the personalities of the characters, lowers the general boredom of listening to an audio book, and creates much immersion. Jennings, with his slight English accent, is crystal clear in his voice. He sounds above the academic and more an intellectual--an aristocrat--who carries the story, and there is no problem in the immersion. He is interesting and perfectly-paced. He reads the text rather happily, without any drone-type sound. He reads delightfully, as though he likes the text and is willing to play the parts.I'm happy with the reader and the audio book. I should add, I have very little experience with audio books. But, Dostoevsky's book is an academic and intellectual classic, and the reading is good, very good."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Every successful writer, at the bottom of their hearts, is a scoundrel, for they capture our hearts with tricks. In Crime and Punishment, the wonderful tactic is carried out in such an unsuspected fashion. For example, if one is to very carefully examine the characters of Sonia, Dounia and Razumihin. One would find almost none of these saintly figures in our real universe. Just think, in this real life, how many girls like Sonia would not be corrupted spiritually? How many very-handsome girls like Dounia will ever be willing to sacrifice her entire life for her relatives? How many Razumihin could there be - without a homosexual tendency - buzzing his male college friend all day long? These fictional characters are rendered in the most ideal fashion. Yet the psychological states of Raskolnikov and, in certain places, Svidrigailov manage to dominate the main fictional stage with such a monstrous life force and reality, that we the readers cannot but accept the credibility of this whole \\"set\\", along with the impossible Sonia, Dounia and Razumihin, as one practical and likely existence. Now, it is the very tension and contrast between the most ideal/angelic/peripheral and the most realistic/vile/central figures, all together in one place, that makes the moral lessons of Raskolnikov stand out all the more vividly. This could even be called the \\"fourth dimension\\" of the sculpture of Raskolnikov. The more angelic these figures around Raskolnikov appear, the more hopeless and visceral the whole experience becomes. This, I think, cannot be the intentional design by Dostoevsky, but he must had somehow pulled it off unconsciously. Yet that is exactly what genius is all about, that one can never attain through conscious and industrious efforts.Those who see the novel as a detective story are grossly mistaken, for it is far more intelligent than those pure games of logic. The most important point is on the return of the sinned, the outcast and the morally depraved back to moral salvation and genuine love. The many subplots, whether they be Raskolnikov's triumphs over Luzhin, or Svidrigailov's victory over himself with Dounia at the last moment, actually all constantly toys with the temporary but fleeting possibility of the reunion of the sinned back to salvation and true love. Thus these subplots are not merely episodes but integral thematic parts of the grand plot!But the core issue, beneath all skins of the text, lies at the discord between the mind and the heart. For example, Svidrigailov's love towards Dounia can be of two opposite kinds. In the calculating, rational and theoretical mind love becomes lust (as with Luzhin), but in the instinctive, conscientious heart, love becomes true, unconditional and altruist love. This universal tension between the mind and the heart is the central dogma of Raskolnikov's phenomenon. That's what made the novel into a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky is packed with a complex characterization, theme, powerful voice, and many other literary devices. For example, Dostoevsky's characters complement each other in order to have a better connection to the plot. Raskolnikov, the protagonist of the novel, can be characterized as bitter and mainly separated from the society created within the book. Raskolnikov, however, is complemented by not only his friend but his love interest as well. Razumikhin and Sonya are both depicted as understanding and caring individuals who may be responsible for the small amount of sanity that is left in Raskolnikov. Not only does the characterization balance the novel, but the novels voice as well. Dostoevsky combines the characters voices alongside the subconscious thoughts of Raskolnikov, paired with the hidden voice of the narrator. The different levels of voice present in Crime and Punishment is a main contributor of the complexity and creativity witnessed in the novelSo, why then is the genuine writing that is found in the novel, absent in the epilogue? The change of the writing style within the epilogue is often regarded as Dostoevsky's superficial attempt to tie-up the novel. The novel ends with a typical conclusion that lacks creativity. The dark nature and chaos that is present the entire novel seems to be lifted up with a curtain of clarity. Dostoevsky is almost trying to push the remaining characters together for a happy finale. Or perhaps the change in style is an attempt to illustrate the ending from a more informal approach or essay-like structure. Either way the epilogue, in a way, eliminates the reader's imagination forcing us to accept his conclusion. At the end of the novel, Dostoevsky at least allows the reader to generate their own conclusions about Raskolnikov and the other characters; until the epilogue weeds off any suspense that may be left.The \\"constructive\\" feedback of the epilogue can also be seen from a clearer light. The epilogue does not possess the exciting whirl wind effect that the novel pulls off, but it does circle back to the main issues that are left dangling from the end of the novel. The two most obvious themes that are further highlighted in the epilogue are isolation from society and religious resentment. The epilogue is also set in a different setting and therefore may be one possible explanation for the unusual writing style. But should a new location change the story line?Although the epilogue does help the reader retrace issues that are demonstrated throughout the whole book (i.e. isolation from society and religious resentment) it also eliminates the reader's imagination and lacks the artistic talent that is present in the novel. The epilogue, therefore, should not be present since there is no new foundation or principle that emerges from the novel.Despite my hesitation to accept the epilogue I still recommend this novel to anyone that is interested in the psychological state of an ordinary man trying to reach a superman status. It is full with a required complexity in order to demonstrate the full scale scenario of the novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is one of the best books I have read by my opinion, it's a deep psychological analysis into a criminal yet somewhat a philosopher's mind. Dostoevsky does a great job describing Raskolnikov, the man who murders an old woman and her sister, and what goes through his mind; which to me is presented in stages. Raskolnikov's beliefs that man should be divided into two groups the superior men and the basic men, the basic men should just work and just live their lives and yet the superior ones should be above the law and do whatever they feel is good for humanity. This thought eventually overwhelms Raskolnikov and he finally decides to murder an old pawnbroker. He starts to enter certain stages of behavior from remorse to anger upon others to depression, etc.Dostoevsky, overall has brilliantly dwelled into the mind of the character and analyzed them thoroughly enough to create such an interesting tale."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A desperate, penniless student named Raskolnikov kills an old woman in her apartment for her money. Before he commits the crime, he justifies his evil plan by reasoning that she is merely a dispicable, greedy, old pawnbroker and he sees no immorality in the deed, he believes the world will be better off without her. Raskolnikov gets away with it, but he then becomes consumed with feelings of guilt which won't leave him alone. This plunges him into a hell of self-persecution, madness and terror. He goes out of his way to allow himself to be interrogated by police. Eventually, he feels a compulsive need to confess his crime, as if to ease his conscience. This classic tale will show you the depths of the criminal mind, exposing the soul of a man who is not a villain but a man possessed of both good and evil just like the rest of us, but who through poverty-stricken desperation and a selfish nihilistic personal philosophy decides to act out on his darkest impulse. Ultimately he must face the consequences of his actions.

This is a very brilliant work from a master storyteller, and I can't recommend it enough.

The many characters (many of which I cannot even pronounce their names) which helps to thicken the story, were either mysterious or you loved them or loved to hate'em. I didn't think I could read a book like this, but I found it easy to read and get in to. Just make sure you have a dictionary at hand. The list of words I wrote down from this book that I didn't know were quite long. The main character really perplexed me as I tried to figure him out. I didn't know whether to love him or hate him. There were at times some dry parts of the book where too much detail was really unnecessary and makes it hard to get through those pages. This book is about sin, redemption, love, mystery, forgiveness, philosophies, and guilt. I'd recommend it to people who love to read, not really for the novice reader."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If I were to give this novel a grade, it would be a C. It was very long and drawn out and did not give any realistic views of life. Dostoevsky should have rewrote this one or gotten someone to edit it. I personally don't understand why people write such drawn out works."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is the story of a poor man in czarist Russia who can only purge himself of his guilt through suffering. It deals with the mental and physical tribulation brought upon him by his crime. His troubles are compounded by the conflicting personalities which he possesses.The central conflict in Crime and Punishment stems from Raskolnikov's crime of murder and his struggles with his conscience over whether or not he should confess to the police. Atone level, therefore, it is a kind of detective story where the police seek the criminal, and he evades arrest until the last pages of the novel.On a deeper level, the conflict springs from Raskolnikov's exaggerated theories of \\"the extraordinary man\\" and how such western ideas are opposed to the Slavophile concepts indigenous to Russia. The novel also highlights the eternal conflict between theforces of good and those of evil.Raskolnikov, the protagonist of Dostoevsky's novel, is a handsome and brilliant law student who holds firm but unusual views. He believes that certain superior people in a society standabove the ordinary human and moral laws. To test his thesis, he murders an old woman that is a greedy moneylender. He feels her death is no great loss to society because she preys upon the misery and poverty of her fellow humans.After the deed, he is seized by alternate moods of great cunning with which he tries to outwit the police and moments of nagging guilt when he resolves to confess his crime. Through this fascinating study of a criminal's conscience.On the surface level, the antagonist is apparently the police force of St. Petersburg, especially Porfiry Petrovitch, who investigates the murders that Raskolnikov has committed. All through the novel, the murderer attempts to evade arrest and to mislead the police. However, on a deeper level, the very order of autocratic society in Tsarist Russia seems to be the antagonist against whom Raskolnikov is pitted. He theorizes that vicious, predatory humans like the pawnbroker are evil and deserve to be eliminated in a society that permits such vile people to prosper.Raskolnikov also believes that some \\"extraordinary\\" humans like himself have the right to transgress and oppose ordinary social laws in order to create a new and more just social order. At another level, ironically, Raskolnikov himself may also be looked upon as the antagonist of conventional society and its unjust system.Throughout the novel, Raskolnikov toys with the idea of confessing his guilt. However, he never manages to do so. He brings himself to reveal to Sonia that it was he who murdered the moneylender and her half-sister, Lizaveta. Although she is deeply shocked by his terrible revelation, Sonia promises to share in Raskolnikov's future sufferings and punishment in a Siberian prison camp.The apparent theme of the novel is that of planning and executing the perfect crime, as well as the subsequent suffering on the part of the criminal and his obsessive need to confess. Only the first part of the novel deals with the careful planning that precedes the crime. The other five parts are concerned with Raskolnikov's intermittent moments of remorse and his overwhelming desire to confess and to rid himself of the guilt. However, he is unable to do so until the end of the novel. The act of murder and its effects on the mind of the killer form the central subject of Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment.Linked closely to this cycle of crime and confession is the motif of all-encompassing fear. This fear reduces Raskolnikov to a quivering mass of indecision, subject to spells of illness, emotionaloutbursts of anger and horrible nightmares. The crime and its long-term effects on Raskolnikov's behavior and peace of mind become the very punishment itself. Only in Siberia does he overcome the fear and begin the difficult process of social rehabilitation and moral regeneration.One of the important minor themes of this novel is that of the emotional estrangement and social isolation suffered by Raskolnikov, especially after he turns into a criminal. He feels terribly lonely and utterly devastated by his inability to turn to anyone after the double murder. He feels some sympathy for the unfortunate Marmeladov, who dies in a street accident and for the woman who attempts suicide in the River Neva. Sonia's patience and profound understanding finally help him to bring himself to confess his crime and ultimately to reintegrate into ordinary humansociety.To reinforce the theme of isolation and alienation, Dostoevsky makes Raskolnikov often think of \\"the square yard of space\\" to which his crime has confined him. In addition, the novelist frequently introduces the motif of \\"fresh air\\" as a cure for the criminal's isolation and intermittent periods of sickness.Raskolinikov justified his act as follows. Napolean attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrong doing, but have over stepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied that he was a genius too-that is he was convinced of it for a time. According to him he has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, but was incapable of overstepping the law, and so he is not a man of genius. And that was more humiliating for him a young man with pride than a murder he had committed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a story that deeply analyzes the human psyche. Learn what is going through the mind of a murderer who later regrets his vice. Walk with him as his conscience tortures him to mental breakdown. Know what he feels and what he thinks. Learn how his mind ignored murder laws, morals, and ethics until after he has committed the murder. In the end, you will rejoice with him as he chooses to do penance for his evils.Dostoevsky has ingeniously constructed a tale that strongly reels his readers in. As readers, we easily become one with Dostoevsky's hero. Although murderers are hated in just about every culture, Dostoevsky has presented to us a murderer that invokes our sympathy.This is a masterpiece that all advanced societies will one day highly regard. Once a Russian classic, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is now a literary treasure.If you want to read another book with a writing style that is similar to this one, I recommend &quot;Lolita&quot; by Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'll start off with some criticism, however, though it doesn't pertain to the actual story itself. I don't like how in 19th century novels authors frequently like to have one character babble for pages upon pages. Dickens is infamous for it, and though there isn't that much of this in Dostoevsky's work (at least in this book) I find it boring when he does partake in this awful style of writing. If it wasn't for the great amount of respect I have for this novel, I would have given it 4 stars as a result. C&amp;P is a deep and philosophical work of literature. Raskolnikov, the centre of the tale, is a striking figure by all accounts, and one of the most extraordinary and complex persons I have ever been introduced to in any novel. He's still debated to this day -- and people continue to write more and more essays centring on his personality and actions. Let's just say there's a lot to say about Rodion Raskolnikov, and the author allows the reader to largely discover him for themselves, rather than to merely tell us what he's like. The whole book can be discussed at great length. As I said, it is very philosophical, and it seems to centre around the concept of nihilism. Raskolnikov has his own ideas, no doubt influenced by the nihilistic tendencies of the 19th century Russian intelligentsia, and these beliefs that he formulated were what compelled him towards a bloody murder near the beginning of the book. From there we are catapulted into a dark and serious psychological thriller (as it is commonly called), where we are forced to explore the psyche of this man against the backdrop of a dreary, dark and depressing St. Petersburg. This is a book to think about. I have my own ideas, of course, just like everybody has. Everyone is free to interpret what Dostoevsky is trying to get across, and to agree or disagree wit him. Read it with care. (I still don't know what Svidraigalov's dreams symbolize.)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a mal-shaped book structurally. Raskolnikov suggests to the lawman about mid-way through this long book that he is the killer...and then the book still has hundreds of pages to go! The second half seemed to me a lot of filler. I think THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV a masterpiece, and it is also about a murder. But CRIME AND PUNISHMENT doesn't deserved its classic status. And Nabokov detested Dostoevsky, because he didn't like the idea of characters coming to spiritual awakening through horrendous acts. And, while I think Dostoevsky was a better writer than Nabokov thought he was, that's one of the problems I had with this book: In the end you're supposed to feel uplifted by Raskolnikov's &quot;awakening,&quot; but all I could think was, &quot;But the guy murdered two women! He should be drowned in the river he is standing near!&quot;"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Is it just me, or does it seem that almost everyone who gave this book a really bad review posted with horrible misspellings?

And it is free, so you cant really really regret getting it.Did I mention it's free?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I simply love this novel by Dostoyevsky! Not only is it a literary masterpiece, but it proposes many philosophical questions as well. For example, the main character (Raskolnikov) speaks about a very interesting idea, the everyman - superman theory. This is an idea that there are two sets of people in the world: the everyman and the superman. The everyman is the ordinary person who lives by all laws that society establishes and they must conform to all circumstances. There are however the supermen, the people who are born in very few numbers, maybe one in a few million, and they are above all laws. The supermen are those that are immune to any restrictions and can even kill people and break the most fundamental laws of society in order to accomplish their goals. They not only have the ability to do so but they have the desire to do so. They also have a need to become better than other people. Raskolnikov uses the example of Isaac Newton and how his accomplishments were so important that it would have been acceptable (in his opinion) if Newton killed tens or even hundreds of people so long as he came to his discoveries.Raskolnikov then gives his opinions on where he stands according to this idea but I won't give that away, that would ruin the novel. I definitely think this is a must read for anyone who has some free time on their hands or someone who wants to tackle a philosophical challenge. It gets five stars from me and you should give it a shot too."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm a new fan of Russian Literature. For about five years I have owned Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, War and Peace and Doctor Zhivago. They looked good on the shelves and I joked to my friends that someday I would set down Dickens, Steinbeck and Dumas and read one of these Russian classics. Thankfully that time arrived and Crime and Punishment did not let me down. The pace is a little slower with less action and more introspective thought, but once I got used to the rhythm I was so drawn in that I couldn't stop. The characters were so colorful and three dimensional, not to mention the storyline itself, which really makes you think about the fine line between thinking about committing a crime and taking action. I'm ready for Nabokov and Tolstoy.

Throughout the book, Dostoevsky Transports the reader deep into &quot;Rodja's&quot; mind, in justifying his actions. What's great about this book is the detailed and personal development of all the characters, especially Raskolnikov who in the end does what's right. Read it for yourselves, It's definitely worth is and it's very challenging because it raises up many many questions. One warning is that the book has a very dark and pessimistic view of human nature. I would like to personally think that mankind is far better than what's described in the book, but hey!, knock on wood, sometimes i wake to a reality I would rather ignore, and this book exposed me to how cold and cruel the world we inhabit can be."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment offers the best of Dostoevsky'spre-existential existentialism, but is mired ...(by) its length and unnecessary details.

The revelation that comes to Raskolnikov through love and humility &quot;in prison, in freedom,&quot; is inevitable becase it is the obverse side, the pro, of the will-to-suffering, the contra, that has been throughout the entire novel his primary motivation.

Usually, I can at the very least quickly classify a book in the broad terms of \\"I liked it\\" or \\"I didn't like it.\\" Crime and Punishment doesn't really fit in this paradigm. I can't tell you if I liked it or not, because I don't know. In fact, it almost defies description at all. Nevertheless, I will say what I can about Dostoyevsky's novel.The basic plot centers on a young man named Raskolnikov who commits a double murder early on in the story. The rest of the book details the slow, agonizing punishment of that crime, which for him is an internal battle between his intellect, which says that he has done no wrong, and his conscience, which informs him that what he did was in fact very wrong. His internal strife slowly eats away at Raskolnikov to the point where he confesses his crime and is sent to Siberia for hard labor. While in Siberia, his suffering for his misdeeds reaches a climax, and as a result he finds redemption and is reanimated as a person. His soul is restored.The positive elements of the book are several: First, there are multiple scenes which evoked strong emotional reactions as I read. Dostoyevsky had an amazing ability to write viscerally. Second, the novel displays (accurately, in my view) the destructiveness of adhering to a false worldview. Raskolnikov came close to breaking down throughout the story, precisely because he could not reconcile his worldview with reality. Conversely, the author represents well the transformation or regeneration that occurs with true repentance--a lesson that will forever ring true.There are several negative elements of the book, though. As is typical with Russian literature, it is a heavy, long read. I personally could not say that I enjoyed reading it, but while hard, it was worthwhile. (Perhaps it is the literary equivalent to eating one's vegetables?) In addition, Dostoyevsky had several side stories that dealt with the current events of the day--events with which I was completely in the dark. I admit, this is probably more of a commentary on myself than the book, but since I am not in academia and have precious little time to read as it is, it makes little sense for me to study up on such details just to read a book.Overall, I am just not sure what to do with this book. It speaks to the reader on multiple levels and contains much that is good, but it was not particularly a \\"good read\\" in the sense that it was not a book I would recommend to curl up with next to a fire. Reading it was more like running a marathon without knowing where the finish line was. On balance, I am rating this book 3 stars, which I freely admit may reflect more on me than Dostoyevsky's classic work."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use!

All the same, there's a reason why Crime & Punishment is considered the quintessential Dostoevsky novel. Compared to The Brothers' Karamazov, which is as plot driven as it is character driven, C&P is much more character driven - delving deeper into the developing neurosis of Raskolnikov. Despite the fact that it is not plot driven, it's a very quick read compared to The Brothers' Karamazov and other works of fiction of comparative length (can easily throw down 100 pages or more of C&P in a day). My only complaint is the ending - the loose ends are tied up too abruptly, in a manner which suggests carelessness and a sense of \\"let's just get this over with\\" - in the second to last 40 or 50 pages not much happens, and then suddenly several months are condensed into a few pages for the epilogue. It was a bit perturbing considering Dostoevsky invested several hundred pages into the rest of the book, he might have taken more care to address the conclusion. Other than that, it's a super-classic, quite unlike any other work of fiction."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a wonderful book and a must read for anyone who is a fan of classic literature."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I love rereading this and as a free e-book it was totally worth it.

(Boutght two versions, not sure which version I am reviewing here, as the image associated with it does not match either of the paperbacks that I bought.)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I know some literary historians like to consider the modern, realistic novel as having emerged with like, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and some want to credit even earlier writers like Cervantes, or later writers such as James Joyce, but for me, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is the first novel that truly FEELS modern, and reads modern, and considering that the story was first published in 1866, Dostoevski was 50 years ahead of Dashiell Hammett, and although he followed Edgar Allen Poe by more than a decade, it is difficult not to see his influence on so many writers and even film makers that came later--this has to be regarded as a singular, seminal work. It's the story of an axe murderer who commits a double homicide in cold blood, for crying out loud!And yet, I don't know how Dostoevski does it, but Raskolnikov never really becomes an unsympathetic character. Maybe because his description of the old pawn broker was so loathsome, and yet, the reader is closely identified with Raskolnikov's point of view in the preparations leading up to the fateful events, in the brutal murders themselves, in the feverish aftermath, and all the way up to his final confession. The characters are complex. Raskolnikov is complex. The investigator, Porfiry, is complex (he was after all the model for the detective Columbo). In fact, the story is populated with complex characters who are a mixture of black and white, strengths and weaknesses, that contributes to the absolute realism.How it came to be is a mystery of nature, but Dostoevski's psychological insights are nothing short of breathtaking. And, although the rationalization is obvious, the point that Raskolnikov makes about the difference between the great leaders who murder in the thousands during wars and revolutions, vs the man who kills once or twice but with the same goal of improving the existential conditions of humankind--because he simply must survive and may yet live to make an important contribution if he does--well, I don't remember seeing this argument made anywhere in literature before this point-- and it is obviously an issue that Doesoevski himself must have wrestled with intimately. His father was, after all murdered by peasants, and at one point in his life, because of his political activities, he was confronted with the certainty that he would be shot by a firing squad in the morning--and how that much anticipated night must have stretched out before him, and concentrated his mind most wonderfully. Of course, at the last moment, orders from the Czar arrived to commute his sentence to exile in a Siberian labor camp--but he spent the next 4 years working with men who were there not because of political agitation, but for murders and assaults and crimes of brutality. He isn't trying to coax us onto the slippery path of moral relativity, but he wants us to think long and hard about the nature of the Law vs the nature of what is right vs the nature of what is permissible and even acceptable. I mean, look around at the various instances of mass genocide, and draw the observation of who has been indicted for war crimes, and who has not. He also wants us to think about whether or not a punishment fits the crime--whether it settles the debt--if that is what a crime is--a debt that is owed to 'society'. Is that what a crime is--or is it something more transcendental, a 'disturbance' in the force that must be rectified at the Cosmic scale. For, if that is the case, then what is the debt owed to society from the commission of crimes without a victim? How does the victimless 'crime' disturb the Harmony of the Universe? Does the punishment restore the scales of Justice? What IS a crime? Is the sacrifice of the lamb upon the alter a crime? Aggression in combat on the battlefield we justify as self defense? But what about computer programs operating drone aircraft and launching missiles whenever the target acquisition algorithm is activated by a truth table? Or rapacious Corporate Piracy in the form of a hostile takeover? Misleading and deceiving the public through false claims? Well, certainly a crime is defined by law--but how many actions are simply wrong that are not criminal--for which there is no systematic institutional punishment? And in those cases, is there any form of guilt? Is there to be no form of punishment?This is a profoundly thought provoking novel, and it is as much of a thriller as it is a work of profound philosophical speculation. Given the weight of the issues that it raised and thrust into the light of contemplation, there isn't a moment of dryness, or pedantry or sophistry--in fact, as both a social commentary and a detective story, it is relentless. The atmosphere of personal psychological terror with no exit anticipates Kafka by several decades, and is laced with notions common to Kierkegaard. I can only presume that Dostoevski must have been familiar with \\"Fear and Trembling\\" -- the similarity of themes is too much of a coincidence. Kierkegaard's title is a reference to a line from Philippians 2:12, \\"...continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.\\" Which of course, is exactly what Raskolnikov does. In the case of Kierkegaard, he wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been felt by Abraham when \\"God tested and said to him, take Isaac, your only son, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain that I shall show you.\\" Of course, in the case of Raskolnikov, he was never commanded in a Divine encounter to sacrifice the old pawn broker and her pathetic sister, and no Agent arrived in the nick of time to stay his hand--but there is something in the nature of this sort of crime that won't lay down and be silent, at least not to one who is no psychopath. And Raskolnikov may have been arrogant and desperate, but he was no true psychopath--and the torment that he feels is so unrelentingly obvious that it is inevitable that he must confess and accept his punishment. And so, we are left with the final question--here is a crime, here is the acceptance of guilt, and here is the punishment. Was justice done? Were the scales restored to balance? And yet, within a society of supposed civilized institutions--is there any real alternative?There is one more issue that Dostoevski wrestles with throughout this story--and that is the subject of mercy vs persecution, of kindness vs cruelty, and he shares insight about the nature of empathy, of warm feelings and trust vs the lack of feeling that can ignore a dying man, or drive a small child into the cold and damp, or beat a poor horse to death in the street, or trap a young woman and torment her pitilessly--or even take an axe to an old woman who is pleading for her life. In each of these situations he is asking the same question over and over, and again and again, seems to be making the case for mercy, whose quality is never strained, and drops as the gentle rain from heaven on the place beneath, twice blessed, both to the giver and the taker. It is the mightiest, and becomes the throned monarch better than his crown...therefore, though Justice be your plea, consider this--\\"that in the course of Justice, NONE of us should see Salvation...we do pray for Mercy, and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of Mercy.\\" (as Billy the Bard put it)When Dostoevsky faced the firing squad, was he thinking of Mercy? Was he praying for mercy as they tied the blindfold over his eyes? How did it feel when he heard the gunshots, then, after reflection felt no stabbing pains, and moments later, had his blindfold removed, only to hear the words Siberia for you--in that moment did he come to know the particular quality of Mercy?Because, in the final analysis, ultimately: Grace trumps Karma."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The fact that he wrote this on one attempt with so few grammar and spelling erros is amazing. He makes you feel nervous while you read, so you feel like the criminal. you can understand how the main character drifts deeper and deeper into the darkness until he commits the crime.

This is a lesson on how to write about describing emotion and body language, to tell a story."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Without a doubt, the best book I've ever read is \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. That probably has a lot to do with the fact that I myself am being punished for a crime, or maybe I would have liked it anyway, because, after all, it is considered one of the greatest works of literature.Dostoyevsky's life itself makes a great story. He was imprisoned in 1849 for participating in a French utopian socialist group. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted only after he stood before the firing squad in a mock execution. Talk about a game-changer.\\"Crime and Punishment\\" tells the story of Raskolnikov, a young university student who comes up with a theory that men are divided into two categories: ordinary and extraordinary. The latter, Napoleon for example, have the right to transgress the law in any way to achieve their objectives. And so Raskolnikov believed he could commit one vile act - rob and murder an old pawnbroker - in order to obtain the money he needed to begin his mission and prove that he was extraordinary.But things didn't work out as planned. His conscience drives him to madness before he can prove his theory. Dostoyevsky paints the picture of a man who will give his last farthing to someone suffering and in need, and yet is still capable of committing the most loathsome criminal act - all for the sake of a theory.I found myself hoping he could get away with it, and of course, I questioned whether that was because of some moral flaw in my part. But in the end, I saw that the only way out for Raskolnikov was to confess and accept his suffering.I think this passage where Porfiry urges Raskolnikov to confess best conveys the essence of the book: \\"You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something base, that's true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base! At least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the furthest point in one bound.How do I regard you? I regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they have found faith in God. Find it and you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. Suffer!...I know you don't believe in it - but don't be over-wise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid - the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again.\\"In life, suffering is unavoidable and inevitable. The sooner we accept it, the sooner we can fling ourselves into life and the sooner we can be free...even in prison.Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book was well writen.

It turned out to be a brilliant treatise into the mind of anapparent psychopath, but may just be any one of us who decides to play God. The characters are brought to life wonderfully by Dostoevsky and their personalities will be recognizable to you. The entangling of the main character's justification for his crime with the psychological drama of his daily life and of those around him, will draw you in and having you asking big questions of your own conscience. The story was written during pre-communist Russia. This provides a great addition to the storyline - a time and place of transition of a historically Christian society into the post-modern world where God is an abstract crutch or doesn't exist at all.

My teacher, Harriet Balle of University City High School in San Diego, was largely a waste of time in terms of her ability to teach us anything useful about the book. Fortunately, she had the good taste to recognize Dostoevsky as a author worthy of teaching to 12th-graders.Upon starting the book at the time -- keep in mind I had read most of Shakespeare's plays, Graham Greene's \\"Power and the Glory,\\" as well as Solzhenitsyn's \\"The First Circle\\" -- I thought it an immense waste of time. In fact, I can honestly say that I read through the bulk of its 400 plus pages without batting much of an eye until the very end, when Raskolnikov, such a [..]through most of it, suddenly begs the forgiveness of Sonya, the prostitute.That's when I wanted to get down on the floor myself. It was quite unlike any other sensation I've ever experienced before or since, and no other art form has ever produced it in me.

It was however written originally as a piece of propaganda. Its author was a political conservative who was concerned about the spread of Western ideas in Russia and how they could destroy society. It was a theme that he was to return to in some of his other novels notably the Devils. The book was written at a time when novels produced in Russia had to be supportive of the autocratic system and this was passed by a state board.The central theme is about a young student who decides to kill an older woman in his apartment block. The reason for the murder is not gain but rather to show that he is a person who is free and like a Napoleon. Dostoevsky also intended to write another novel called the drunkard at the same time. The plot of that novel involved a man who forces his daughter into prostitution because of his inability to control his urges. Instead of bringing them out as separate novels Dostoevsky intertwines the two stories and makes the young prostitute the means by which his main character can be redeemed.The book starts with the murder and follows the gradual realisation by the police of the identity of the murderer. Although the book started out as a simple expose of the way that western ideas could corrupt the youth of Russia it grew into something else. In part that was because of the development, some time after the novel was published, of philosophical systems which stressed a moralism of self actualisation. The sorts of systems of Nietchze and Kirkagaard. It is also a novel which tends to speak to young people. At least once in a young person's life they feel like the hero, wanting to do some act which defines them as superior to the common heard, to express their freedom or individuality. Ironically they identify with the hero who is meant to be an example of a person who is redeemed by rejecting the sorts of ideas which is the reason why people now read the book.Whilst the main attraction of the book is a message which was at variance with the reason it was written it is still a classic. Everyone has to read this as it is one of the most remarkable books written."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky was one of hemingway's favorite authors. That's interesting. One russian and another american. And i think some psychological perspectives of these two writers complement each other. This is a story about a man tormented with guilt. Hemingway himself expressed these same problems (even in his real life). So why does one reviewer refer to crime and punishment in the terms of blah, blah, boring, written in napkins, and then sends a book by John Steinbeck into the stratosphere?) I think that if you read Crime and Punishment you'll see why many americans think they are a little above everyone else. Our conscience doesn't always lead us where we want to go.

By the way, i'm not either one."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The complexity of the character of Raskalnikov gives great insight into an analytical mind of a realist who judges the norms we have in society such as the values of life and whether or not murder is justifiable. This was a great feat in mid 1800s Russia because the mind of Raskalnikov can be compared to that of many serial killers and gives us insight into what kinds of thaughts they share in common. Its unfortunate that the closeminded undereducated can not see many underlying meanings within the book that help develop Raskalnikov, and the complexity of the other characters. It takes intelligence, not action thrills and courtroom twists, like a certain author well leave nameless(Grisham). This is definetly a classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book really shows how the human mind works.

But there is just too much narrative contrivance and reliance on formulas and coincidence for this to be considered a masterwork of literature. You start to see Dostoevsky's tricks coming from a distance: \\"Aha, do I see another surprise appearance by the policeman to provide a round of gut-wrenching suspense in the next chapter\\", \\"oh, I guess that this suicide is foreshadowing another more significant one later\\", \\"yes, it's time for another character to break down to add some drama\\", etc. The \\"philosophical\\" question in the book, about the moral ramifications of the \\"Great Man\\", is utterly contrived and not convincingly developed. And much of the book is delivered in long-winded monologues by the characters.Add it all up and you have a book that can be a real chore to get through. If you can get past all this, you'll be treated to some excellent deep psychology, but is it worth the effort?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Little is known about the reclusive author of this fine book.

It's really an interesting read. (And if you read it carefully, you'll notice that the word \\"yellow\\" is used to describe something dirty, unclean, or polluted)This will be a short overview ^-^. Raskonikov wanted to help a lot of people by killing the old pawnbroker, Alyona. He wanted to help the number of people she was cheating, his sister Dunia by not having to marry Luzhin, and Lizaveta b/c she was beating her. So he kills the Alyona, but he carelessly leaves the door open and Lizaveta (step-sister of Alyona) walks sees everything. In haste he kills her too. He takes what he can but he is trapped whne Alyona's other appointments go to see her. He gets away and hides the loot under a rock. He visits his old friend Razumikhin and they talk, but he is becoming sick/dilerious.His mother and sister arrive to get married. He meets Luzhin and doesnt like him and visa versa. Raskolnikov later tells Dunia that it is either him or Luzhin. She picks him when her mother learns that Svidrigailov (friends husband who tried to seduce Dunia), or rather his late wife, leaves them 3,000 roubles.Raskolnikov goes into delirum again and ends up going for a walk. He finds his old friend, Marmelodov (whom he met in a bar), lying in the street. He was trampled by horses. He takes him back to his lodgings and he dies there. Raskolnikov says he'll pay for everything.....Making a long story short. He falls for Sonia, Marmelodov's daughter. He goes to prision for 8 years, Razumkhin marries Sonia, the mom dies, Svidrigailov....well, you'll just have to read about him.

This fog enshrouded capital of Peter the Great is the site of the murder story. A young, penniless former law student Rodion Raskolnikov is a scholastic dropout who spends his days in the squalor of a small apartment in the slums. He has been imbued with the philosophy of Nietzche and the nihilism which were popular beliefs nineteenth century Russian intellectual circles. Raskolnikov believes he is superior to the vast majority of humankind. To implement this hubristic stance he decides to kill a greedy pawnbroker. He kills the old lady and her sister with an ax. He robs them and believes he will never be punished for the crime.In addition to this major story we meet Raskolnikov's sister who has been seduced by a rich aristocrat and is living at home with their mother. We also meet the saint-like Sonya a poor girl forced into prostitution as a means to feed her starving family. All of the major characters are undergoing poverty, illness and suffering through their tormented lives. Countless pages of the long novel deal with their various philosophies concerning life, the fate of Russia and the Christian gospel's relevance and importance in modern life.The novel ends with hope as Raskolnikov repents of his crimes; is sentenced to eight years in Siberia and wins the love of the prostitute Sonya. Dostoevsky is adept at exploring the minid of his characters. His descriptions of St. Petersburg life are detailed bringing his tale to life.This is a pyschological novel which has influenced the course of the introspective novel of the twentieth century. Dostoevsky had been banished to Siberia and understood human suffering perhaps better than any major novelist. It was refreshing to this reviewer that the novel is written from a Christian perspective giving sinners home for forgiveness through the grace of Jesus Christ.Due to the long Russian names, the complicated plot and the number of characters the book is not an easy read. It is, however, worthy of your time and attention. Dostoevsky is an author well worth knowing. The book can be read and re-read throughout life with profit to the reader. It is a spiritual odyssesy through the rings of hell culminating in the joy experienced by earthly and heavenly love."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you have not yet read this novel you are lacking an experience that will change the way you feel about the act of reading. I posit that regardless of what kind of literature you prefer, this work will affect you.I have just finished reading Crime and Punishment for the third time. In doing so, I reconfirmed that what is so gripping about the novel is its psychology. In reality, there is very little going on in the way of physical action. On a cerebral level however, the output of the prose is almost overwhelming. Given the author's own history with nervous instability and his gift for understanding the deeper psyche of modern man, the result of his writing is hyper-intense and visceral. The dream sequences are vivid and disturbing; a talent which has not yet been duplicated by another author as far as I am concerned. The nervous passion with which the main character's terror and excitement are related literally latches on to the reader. Crime and Punishment, at the very least, is an enthralling page-turner. Good luck trying to put it down!While I take issue with the somewhat weak and seemingly incongruent Epilogue (I am not alone in this opinion) I can guarantee you an extremely enriching literary experience in Crime and Punishment. Nearly every second is fraught with emotional overload on the part of the novel's hero, \\"Raskolnikov\\" (which translates to \\"religious schismatic\\"). He is not a likeable character necessarily, but he will intrigue you nonetheless. If you read this and do not find yourself exhilarated, check to see if you have a pulse!This is, without question, one of the must-reads of world literature. If you've any interest in the duality, criminality, and psychology of Man, dive in! To go through your whole life without having read this work is a mistake."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Easily the most exciting novel I have ever read. What gripping drama and what unforgettable characters! I though Tolstoy was great but Dostoevsky is even better. Now on to The Brothers Karamazov. I hope it's just as good."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is probably Dostoyevsky's most famous novel, and with good reason. It contains his famous features of intense psychological, philosophical and emotional enquiry, coupled with the presentation of suffering, a multi-layered meaning as well as different ideas along with his own Russian Orthodox Christian viewpoint. However, the book is also more accessible than most others.One of the main reasons is that it has an actual, tangible plot, and can be seen as a piece of crime fiction. The main storyline is Raskolnikov, a poor student in St Petersburgh, who kills an old lady who is a usurer. He spends most of the novel contemplating, reacting, suffering, running and interacting with others as a direct influence and result of his crime. The characters are also unforgettable as Dostoyevsky presents a very chilling picture of the suffering of many people (for instance the poor) in his contemporary, urban Russia.There is much philosophy in the book, and on that level, this is a mature enough book for there to be no point in trying to get at \\"what the meaning is\\". What is important is just how vividly and strongly the inner world of the characters is portrayed - as an entire landscape of thoughts, desires and interactions.While I read Crime and Punishment, I thought that one of the key questions is simply \\"what were the exact reasons for Raskolnikov's crime?\\". The book presents a very interesting range of possible explanations and it is sorting through them that makes the reading personal. However, one philosophical point that seems explicit enough to mention is Dostoyevsky's reaction to Raskolnikov and his \\"circle\\" as examples of a new, \\"atheist/nihilist\\" - but really materialist - schools of throught that were new in Russia at the time. I think one of the hundreds of aims of the book for Dostoyevsky was to show what he saw as the inadequacy of materialism in living your life. Whether you agree or disagree, the book presents what happens when certain ideas are pushed to the extreme.Overall, the book isn't too long but a very challenging read, both intellectually and emotionally. But it's absolutely amazing.As a final note, I read this in the original Russian so I can't make any statements about this particular edition/translation, or any other."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"3, From the beginning of Crime and Punishment to the very end, Fyodor Dostoyevsky delights readers with his amazing characters and suspenseful setting. The book focuses on a young man out of college, Raskolnikov. He decides to murder a pawnbroker to support his idea that some people are superior and are above morals. What follows is an epic journey into Raskolnikov's punishment and redemption. Along the way, readers glimpse the dreary world that surrounds him and the fates of those around him.The characters in Crime and Punishment are the shining stars of the novel. From the prideful and distant Raskolnikov to the compassionate and caring Sonia, from the strong and beautiful Dounia to the crazy and mysterious Svidrigailov, each person in this novel is very unique and adds their own piece to the drama surrounding Raskolnikov. Several subplots are present, such as the story of the Marmeladov family's fall into ruin, which are entertaining and add to the story as a whole. The story itself is very solid as well, engaging readers with Raskolnikov and everything that follows him after his grizzly deeds.Crime and Punishment is one of my favorite novels. I was plesently surprised at how great this book is. Dostoyevsky is a master at characterization, and it shows in his work. The plot is engaging and really drew my attention. I heartily recommend Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment\\", published in 1866, is one of those books that one reads many times in his/her lifetime and which impregnates your spirit and soul with the self-imprecatory and dense prose of a deranged and disillusioned man, its author being the greatest of the Russian prose writers, Fiodor Dostoievski (1821-1881).This is my second time reading and I am sure I will get back to it eventually many times still.Despite the deep density of all its characters, all of them unabashedly portraying and surrendering themselves to the reader's judgement, sometimes even anticipating them, in the most clear-cut and realistic way - but at the same time seemingly disdaining the pity that one should visit upon them - this is one of those very few books you read with the weird sensation that you are the author, not Dostoievski, something that can only be ascribed to the profoundly realistic knowledge of the human dramas that surround human condition at its worst, in this case, the poor inhabitants of czarist Saint Petersburgo of the XIX century. Also, besides being essentially Russian and universal at the same time, it is auto-biographical at its core, where the protagonist Raskolnikov is easily identified with the man Dostoievsky not only for the Oedipus complex open ajar to the reader discretion.In my opinion, this is one of the 10 best prose books of the Occidental Classical Literature ever written and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I started to read this book because i had to, but no i am overjoyed that I had to chance to read this classic.

This is not TOm CLancy and all that garbage. This is a book you must meditate on for a while. Of course it can take you 4 months! What appears to be superfluous is not. It is packed with interesting philosophical insights. Reading should not be a &quot;race,&quot; it's a delicate intellectual pursuit. So, please, do not blame it on Dosto for not writing a page-turner! Readers of the world, unite for the Classics against the evils of American pseudo-literature and reader-digestry!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Only the Brothers Karamazov could possibly compete with Crime and Punishment for the title of Dostoevsky's best novel.Crime and Punishment is an amazing literary feat. In this story of sin and redemption Dostoevsky weaves a great tale. It is a theological novel, a philisophical novel and possibly the finest psychological novel ever written. He studies his characters motives and intent, his philisophical values and how Raskalnikov justifies his actions which by any normal measure is a sinful one. Eventually even Raskalnikov realizes that he is not above other men, intelligence doesn't create a special dispensation for crimes. It's Raskalnikov's journey from guilt to redemption which make this a great study.In some ways much of the angst of Raskalnikov can be understood better if the reader comes from a &quot;high church&quot; background such as (especially) Orthodox or Catholic. Much of the guilt and redemptives aspects of the story are framed in the theology of Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodoxy (easily recognizable to Catholics and Episcipalians).Nineteenth century St Petersburg comes alive. Dostoevsky based his locations on actual streets and apartments; today you can still tour parts of St Pete's and find the actual apartments still in existence (and being lived in).This is a deeply serious work and one not to be taken lightly. One of the few books that I can say may effect you life."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book has always given me a problem. It repulses me. Yet I consider the novel one of my finest reads.When Raskolnikov puts his ear to the door to listen to the footsteps in the hallway, he hears someone on the other side of the door putting his ear to the wood also.He is terrified to realize an inch or so of wood separates the ear of the murderer and the ear of the law. My hair turns white just thinking about it.That part has always given me the creeps. Like the dream about being locked un a shed full of spiders. That is also in this book.You cannot go through life without reading this book at least once. It is a great crime story, albeit a dark story. The detective is as evil as the murderer is good.This is not a book that can be read many times. It is dark and oppresive. It is full of spiders."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the first Dostoevsky book I have read, and I liked it immensely. I decided to read it because of the intriguing plot, as well as Dostoevsky's reputation. Something interesting about this novel is that Dostoevsky used a very &quot;backwards&quot; sort of character development. He had Raskolnikov commit a murder- with no apparent motive- and then spent the rest of the book exploring the character, rather than the other way around. So first we watch this character commit a horrible, terrible crime, one that we should denounce him for, and then we begin to get to know him, and he is revealed to have an astoundingly good character after all. I found myself liking Raskolnikov greatly, and I was able to identify with him as well. However, this book does not seem to fall under the guidelines of a &quot;crime novel&quot; nor a &quot;psychological thriller&quot;. Yes, there is a crime, as well as a study of the protoganist's psyche, but it is not exactly thrilling. This is not the sort of story where you have to keep reading and reading to find out who committed the crime. You already know. Therefore, there is no mystery to keep you interested. Despite all these obstacles, Dostoevsky does what might be impossible for most writers. He makes you care about what happens to Raskolnikov. I was not thrilled, but engrossed. What kept me reading here was the desire to see if Raskolnikov would defeat his inner demons and turn himself in, or be arrested. I'd rather not reveal the ending but I would like to say that I found it extremely satisfying. The subplot, that of Luzhin trying to gain control over Dounia, might have only gotten in the way of another writer, but Dostoevsky was able to inspire such hate in me for Luzhin that I wanted to keep reading just to see him get what he deserved in the end. After reading this, I have decided to read Dostoevky's other works as well, and hopefully they will all be of the same high quality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment examines one man's decision to kill and his ultimate punishment for it. After one man who feels a sense of desperation (Raskolnikov) decides to kill an old pawnbroker, he delves into a realm of psychological and spiritual anguish and despair. Beforehand he concludes at points that his deed will benefit humanity, for the woman was a despicable person, but the repercussions in the aftermath, namely the isolation from several people of his life--his mother and sister, as well as his friend Razumihin--serve as an avenue to conscientiously come to terms with the act's immorality.Dostoevsky's work creates an atmosphere which is part crime drama and part psychological thriller, but it also has deep philosophical undertones about man's existence---physically and mentally--after the most extreme of crimes. Yet the crime of killing is not the pinnacle of the story (it is committed in the early part of the book), but rather Raskolnikov's punishment, that is, his fall from the depths of society and his mental and physical sickness, that are the novel's essence. Raskolnikov not only deals with his own sense of isolation and delirium as well as the rising suspicion from several officials, but also tries to deal with the problems of his mother and sister, who come to visit him for a time.As unsympathetic as Raskolnikov seems at points, there is also some evidence that he has a moral conscience, and this seems to bring him out of his mental stupor. Under his extreme nervous state he gives his last money to a poor family who eventually loses their father. He also feels a moral obligation to make sure his sister marries someone who is suitable, and that his mother is also taken care of. It takes him quite a deal to get to this point, and because of his agitation, he tells his friend Razumihim to go to his family and make sure they are comforted.It is an association with another troubled character that aids the protagonist. Later in the novel, there is a spiritual connection between Raskolikov and Sonya, a girl who was forced to prostitute to support her family. Unlike Raskolikov, Sonya is deeply religious and moral, praying often and sacrificing and caring for her family and siblings, and seems to bring a healing to Raskolikov's troubled mind. Sonya, in a book rich in despicable characters, symbolizes the purity and saving grace in Raskolikov's world.Dostoevsky's work is rich in philosophy about the nature of crime on one's conscience, this being the novel's crux. Raskolnikov's progression and the penance he must serve are not only in his own suffering, but in his experiences and observations of man's lowliness. The paramount flaw is his belief that he can escape his crime: \\"If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be punishment...\\" (pg. 246).Over all, this is a complex, deep novel that makes one think; this is one of the best psychological crime novels out there, and a superbly written book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I do not wish to tread ground that has already been walked upon--Take what you will from the book--I found it amazing and interesting philosophically, but my point here regards translations and editions:I purchased the mass market paperback version and started reading it, and it was decent, but when I stumbled upon the Norton edition, I realized what I had been missing. The Norton/Jesse Coulson translation is superb; it is the best I've found. The Garnett translation, which is not bad, is on par with others, but I simply wish to add that the Norton edition is, with footnotes and essays and the Coulson translation, worth the extra money for those who wish to enjoy the novel to its fullest."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If Dostoevsky and Tolstoy are considered to be the best of novelists (and they are, by many), Crime and Punishment may thereby be considered one of the greatest literary works, as it substantiated Dostoevsky's claim that he was a great writer (beyond Poor Folk), contrary to what many critics of the time had to say. Common criticism cites flawed style or technique, even claims that Dostoevsky couldn't realize the art he was creating (and so could not have been a real artist). It is for the most part undisputed, however, that Crime and Punishment remains the greatest of psychological novels. It appeals to the reader on a personal level-- time and time again the concept of one &quot;becoming Raskolnikov&quot; is seen in criticism. In my personal experience, I can certainly testify to this. I read the first two parts of the novel on a train from Cologne to Stuttgart, and on stepping off the train, I felt such a connection with Raskolnikov that I was paranoid of being caught by the police for the murder of the old pawnbroker. I was forced to constantly remind myself &quot;it's just a book&quot;. But is it really? Does not the ability of Dostoevsky to influence us this greatly constitute something more than just words on paper? I would encourage anyone to read the book and see for themselves."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I didn't finish \\"Crime and Punishment\\". The reasons I'm about to give made me think twice about typing up a review. My decision has been made however, and some may disagree with my reasons; probably with a disgusted \\"who do you think you are?\\" spoken in my direction. Well, I'm sorry, but do read on if you like.I am not a Dostoevsky newbie. Previously I read \\"The Brothers Karamozov\\" as well as \\"Notes From Underground\\", and both demanded my full attention to grasp what Dostoevsky was trying to put across. He's a very thoughtful writer, and a self-styled philosopher as well. Many times through \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", he would go for page after page, thinking out loud about whatever subject came up, be it infidelity, God, friendships, gambling, social classes, you name it. The same can be said for this novel, although I was getting confused throughout \\"Crime and Punishment\\", so confused in fact that I had to put this book down, and will not likely return to it.The story is not confusing, really. We follow Raskolnikov, a nearly-useless beggarman while he tries to live his pathetic life in 19th century Russia. Dostoevsky paints a bleak picture of the country at that time, with most people being filthy, drunken, poets and \\"intellectuals\\" eeking out a living by begging and mooching off everyone in sight. Raskolnikov (rascal?) is no different, and spends much of his time leeching off relatives and pawning off anything of value to the local pawnbroker. Shortly into the book, he murders said pawnbroker and we follow the wretch as his inner torments get the better of him over time. No, that's not a spoiler; it's right there on the back cover glurge, silly. A simple concept for a book, something we're all familiar with in one form or another, and the way his conscience affects him after the murder should lead to a satisfying novel. Instead, all I got was confusion. I was able to follow the action, but too much of my time was spent piecing together what I THOUGHT was happening, rather than being taken for the ride the writer intends.Asking myself why I was confused, I picked up \\"Brothers\\" again and opened the book randomly. Reading ten or so long-winded pages of that monsterous work, I was NOT confused. So what was my problem with \\"Crime\\"? Was the book written earlier, when Dostoevsky was a lesser writer? No, that can't be it since I read \\"Notes\\" with no problem, and it had been written many years before \\"Crime\\".Then it dawned on me. Translation! Each of these three in my collection have been written by a different translator. In this case the translator is a person named Constance Garnett. Looking into other books in my \\"unread\\" pile, I noticed that Ms. Garnett's translations are considered \\"definitive\\". I gulped. Could it be that this nonsensical style is what Dostoevsky really intends to put in front of his readers? Was my version of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" NOT translated as it was intended? How, then, to reconcile the fact that I LOVED the novel?I don't read Russian. I am personally incapable of translating a novel from ANY language into English. Maybe I am completely off base. But this novel, as translated by Ms. Garnett, is nearly UNREADABLE. It makes very little sense. These characters behave like lunatics, and can't seem to express their thoughts in anything resembling coherency. Razumihin, Raskolnikov's best friend and essentially a 19th century \\"beatnik\\", is incomprehensible in everything he does. Was this intentional? I don't think so, as the characters who interact with him only find him a \\"little\\" strange. I couldn't understand what Raskolnikov was trying to accomplish, WHY he thought the way he did, nor HOW he was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes without even trying. This CANNOT be how Dostoevsky imagined his work would be read. He styles himself a deep thinker; not a clown. And Ms. Garnett makes him a clown though this very poor translation. Grammatically, it is as atrocious as anything I've ever read as well.A new reader to Dostoevsky would probably be pushed toward reading \\"Crime and Punishment\\", as it is his most famous work and considered to be his first important novel. But when presented with this sloppy and unreadable script, it's likely to turn them off for good. I know I would have been. It is a crime, no pun intended, for his most important work to be translated as ham-handed as this. Is it possible that poorly-translated Dostoevsky paved the way for other Russians like Tolstoy to steal the center stage of Russian literature? I think that IS possible, and that is an unforgivable crime as well.If anyone should know of a different English translation of this novel, please let me know. I am unable to finish it in it's present form. In my opinion, Garnett is a very poor translator, and this novel is in dire need of a new, readable translation. New readers to Dostoevsky should steer clear. Buy \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" instead."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov, an impovershed student in 19th Century St. Petersburg, conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker. He justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse. The world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education. Killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes. After all, the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society. The crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with Raskolnikov's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering. Almost every major character in the book is more likeable that Raskolnikov.The philosophy of Dostoyevsky's book seems to be primarily a refutation of Hegelian and proto-Nietschian philosophy and an affirmation of Christian values. Along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of social-Darwinism.Having known, prosecuted, and defended hundreds of murderers, I was much taken by Raskolnikov's psychological progression from crime to atonement. Much of his self justification rang true to my experience. I have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law, and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth. So long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized, the killer can live with the deed. When the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human, guilt sets in and many confess--often years later. Raskolnikov's behavioural symptoms did not, however, ring true to my experience. Although some killers are guilt-ridden to the point of distraction, they can usually control themselves much better than Raskolnikov. His actions practically shouted his guilt.The interplay of the large cast of characters gave the book great psychological depth, but Dostoyevsky didn't beat the reader over the head with the psychology. He didn't tell you what the characters were thinking. Their actions showed you what they were thinking. In my experience, most modern psycho-dramas ladle out the psychology in huge dollops. Modern writers would do well to re-read Dostoyevsky.The abridged audio edition read by Michael Sheen is three hours long, and the tale does not suffer much from the massive abridgement necessary to get the story on three CD's. My greatest complaint with the edition is that Sheen reads the story with a British accent, and the characters all speak with British accents. It was somewhat hard to adjust to a Russian novel read with a British accent."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The negative reviews of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" seem to fall into two catagories: those that found the book \\"boring,\\" \\"full of digressions,\\" and \\"not believable,\\" and those that took issue with the underlying message, confirmed at the very end, that Christianity promises a new life for misguided souls like Raskolnikov who have been corrupted by immoral modern ideas.I once counted myself among those who were bored with the book. Back when I was in college, it did not hold my interest and I set it aside after ten pages or so. I preferred more \\"realistic\\" novels, i.e. those that felt exactly like my small world. Fifteen years later, I found the book absorbing and insightful, but not because I thought Raskolnikov's crime and subsequent states of delerium were exactly \\"true-to-life\\" in all their specifics. I agree with those who were perplexed by Raskolnikov's erratic behavior. At times, it was tiring to follow along with his endlessly agitated moods and continual exhaustion. It seems as if he's at the end of his rope from the first page to the last. However, taking a broader view, he is a young man who rationalizes premeditated murder as a way for him and his mother and sister to escape lives dogged by humiliating poverty. His philosophical notions about crime are a smokescreen and basically immaterial - they're a mishmash of trendy ideas about 'progress' that will enable mankind to escape from 'beastly' fears. Blah, blah, Nietzsche, whatever. What really sets him off is the belief that his sister, whom he obviously loves, is forcing herself to enter a loveless marriage to a wealthy jerk so her family can get a few handouts because her brother is a loser and can't support them. So for me, the book is not about Christian values triumphing over athiestic modern philosophies, and readers who get caught up in this (very thin) thread in the novel are missing the point. I don't even care to know that Dostoevsky's religious beliefs at the time were such and such, and those ideas were simplistic, and they are evident in the novel and... therefore the novel is no good and Dostoevsky is not a great writer... Hunh? If you like fiction and appreciate fully-realized characters whose behavior--Raskolnikov's fits notwithstanding--is rooted in basic human emotions that everyone can identify with like fear, pride, love, guilt, and shame, I think you will enjoy this book. Imagine having to face your own sister after she learns that you murdered two people. The religious angle is not as prominant or as distracting as some of the reviews would lead you to believe.As for the book's \\"meaningless digressions\\" and improbable coincidences, I felt that the author was mainly concerned with the psychological struggles going on within and among the characters and that he stuck to that theme unwaveringly. I read that the published version was 'cut down considerably' from the serialized version by Dostoevsky himself, and I never had the sinking feeling that he was stretching the soup just to fill pages. It's not a sleek modern detective story. It's about people. Admittedly, there were a few 'chance' meetings that felt contrived, but nothing really incredible that made you lose faith in plot--and they usually served to heighten the drama.Here's a teaser: \\"Generally speaking, Mr Luzhin belonged to the class of people who are apparently extremely courteous in society, and indeed extremely anxious to be courteous, but who, if anything should happen to upset them, immediately lose all their airs and graces and become more like sacks of flour than breezy gentlemen whose very presence brings a breath of fresh air into society.\\" Nice, right?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Ever wanted to get inside the head of a murderer? That's exactly what the legendary Russian writer Dostoevsky does in this classic novel. On the face of it, by the usual standards of literature, this doesn't seem to be much of a novel. There isn't much in the way of plot (the murder happens in the early pages, we know who he is from the outset, and the only real suspense revolves around whether or not he will confess). The language is at times awkward and complex. The setting is believable but not captivating. But the people are, and here Dostoevsky excels: characterization. The focus of the novel revolves around the internal struggle within the murderer's mind, as he deals with the consequences of his action as a moral being. Most modern murder mysteries seek to entertain by focusing on the blood and gore; Dostoevsky goes far deeper by focusing on the mind.Dostoevsky has a deep insight into human nature and psychology. In the process of wading through the text, one can expect to come across wonderful pearls like these: \\"I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with their mothers-in-law.\\" (p37) \\"Even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving.\\" (p350) \\"And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind?\\" (p386)This insight into human behaviour especially becomes evident in Dostoevsky's treatment of the murderer Raskolnikov. Many writers are one-dimensional, but Dostoevsky shows how people have a complex system of emotions, often fluctuating from one feeling to the next. He depicts human nature with different layers and moods, as Raskolnikov moves between conflicting emotions such as fear, guilt, remorse, and courage. The brilliance is already evident from the first chapter, where Raskolnikov is introduced as a figure absorbed in selfish isolation. Completely absorbed with the self and away from love of God and man, as he contemplates murdering the old woman pawn-broker Alyona Ivanovna his wretched condition is a convincing portrait of the depravity of the human heart estranged from God. As Raskolnikov later confesses: \\"Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great deal.\\" (p383). With a window into the mind of a murderer, we begin to understand him to the point where we identify with him, and realize that we are all capable of enormous sin. Raskolnikov's loathsome heart is ultimately no different from our own.But Dostoevsky also excels in showing the tragic consequences of depravity: it results in isolation from other human beings, and ultimately from God. Raskolnikov's deteriorating mental and physical state is highly reminiscent of what David says in Psalm 32 about being in bed, wracked with unconfessed guilt. Although Dostoevsky shows the effect of sin more in relation to other humans (isolation) than in relation to God, he succeeds in showing the tragic consequences of the darkness of the human soul. Raskolnikov experiences an increasing sense of isolation. \\"It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\\" (p109) Such comments about the psychology of a murderer are particularly illuminating.Yet there is also a sense of hope, as Raskolnikov finds the answer to guilt and its consequences in heartfelt repentance. This solution is enhanced by way of a contrast with the remedy sought by Svidrigailov. Although his guilt is never directly affirmed, we are left with the distinct impression that Svidrigailov struggles with the same guilt over murder as Raskolnikov. Svidrigailov advises Raskolnikov that he has only two options: Siberia or a bullet in the head. But while Svidrigailov himself chooses the latter option of suicide, Raskolnikov chooses Siberia ... and repentance. This inner transformation leads to significant observable changes in his life, with Sonia functioning as a Christ figure. The novel ends fittingly with both realism and optimism about repentance: \\"He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering. But that is the beginning of a new story - the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.\\" (p505)As a novel, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is not entirely without weaknesses. The occasional blasphemy eg \\"Good God!\\" was surprising. The sentences are sometimes broken, and the flow of the English translation is at times unnatural and difficult to read. Dostoevsky's dialogue is frequently verbose, the lengthy soliloquys unrealistic and tiring. The Russian names are also difficult to keep track of, particularly because characters are at times referred to using different names (to keep your Petrovna's and Petrovitch's apart, consider keeping a character list handy while reading). But these difficulties are in part a result of the inevitable distance that arises from cultural and language differences. In the final analysis this book is not easy to read merely because of its weaknesses but because of its brilliance. Despite the heavy going, it's no \`punishment' to read this book, but rather a \`crime' not to. \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a brilliant psychological and religious study of human depravity, giving you an opportunity to discover something more about your own corruption, as well as its only cure."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The greatest novel of all time was written over a hundred years ago in Russia, by a man few would probably want to spend more than five minutes in the local with. The novel is very, very long, often goes round in circles seemingly nowhere and is infused with a deep religious code that betrays our current vogue for post christian, post socialst malaise. The basic jist of the story is familiar to anybody with a penchant for the t.v series 'Cracker' or the odd Sherlock Holmes novel. So why I hear you cry is it consistently lauded as the greatest story ever told? Simple really, when (and it really is only a matter of when) you read this book to the final page you will never the see the world again through the same eyes. For anybody wishing to foist another piece of literature on us the unsuspecting public, read this book first and then think..... Could you really explain the world we live in any better? Would you not just be repeating something that has already been written? Something with a far greater understanding, deeper compassion? Writing that not only tells us about man's eternal conflict with himself and his brothers, but through beautifully honest prose teaches us that this conflict is actually what makes man seperate from other beings. And then think again, my friend for we have enough books gathering dust on our libary shelves, but we only have one 'Crime And Punishment'"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started to read this novel for high school English class, but I certainly was not expecting it to be the most fascinating, absorbing, suspenseful, powerful, and moving novel I have ever read in my life thus far. From the very first page I was unable to put it down. On the most basic level, Crime and Punishment is just a really good read! There are no boring parts...I was surprised when I found the long philosophical sections to be actually as suspenseful and interesting as any other part of the novel. Raskolnikov is one of the greatest characters I have ever encountered in a novel. Despite his horrible deeds I found him to be incredibly human and sympathetic and I was quite enraptured with him. The other characters are also fully drawn and interesting. The philosophical implications of the book are enormous and one can ponder them for a very long time. The epilogue is the only disappointing part of the book. The power of this extraordinary novel still haunts me and always will."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the second book I have read by Dostoyevsky, although I wish I had read it before &#34;Notes From The Underground.&#34; If you are a fan of Russian Literature then this is essential reading.The struggle that exists on the plane of life between guilt, remorse, and murder is unfathomable. Dostoyevsky clearly and fundamentally points out the struggle between distinguishing genius and madness.Before reading &#34;Crime and Punishment&#34; I was convinced it couldnt get any better than Leo Tolstoy's &#34;War and Peace&#34; and &#34;Anna Karenina&#34;, and I was wrong. Dostoyevsky proves to be oneof the greatest novelists of all time."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read the translation by McDuff. I thought the story was described at an extremely detailed pace, which I didn't like at first. I actually stopped reading after the murder scene, but finished the book two years later. I do think it is not an easy book to read for people who lack exposure to classical books or desire to be well read. For one thing, the book is filled with many conversations and speeches that seem to be long and boring ramblings.But I give five stars for one reason only. The stunning ending and conclusion of the book makes it worth every pain of reading this book. I also thought Sonia's reading of Lazarus story was absolutely powerful to the point of shaking as I was reading the book. McDuff notes that it was the climax of the book. I certainly agree, while same can be said about the confession scene.There are only few books which you will read and NOT forget. Crime and Punishment is an absolutely rare book. I guess a book dealing with the theme of conscience must be written in absolute mastery."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Ex-student Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov has a theory, and one that will change more than one life forever. He believes, with great conviction, that a genius has the moral right to commit murder, theft, and other crimes - just because he is intellectually \\"above\\" others. He believes this so thoroughly that he, believing himself something of a genius, murders a pawnbroker and her sister with an axe and steals the money they have accrued over the years. Just managing to escape, Raskolnikov sinks into a war with his conscience and a delerium that causes others to doubt him. After meeting a drunkard named Semion Marmeladov, Raskolnikov has bouts of generosity and conviction, helping their family with their debts, and then paying for Marmeladov's funeral when he is crushed by a wagon, all the while trying to justify his moral degradation. Then he meets Sonia, Marmeladov's oldest daughter, a young woman who has turned to prostitution to keep her family from sinking further into hunger and destitution. Raskolnikov befriends her, fascinated by the oxymoron she has created: a poor prostitute, sunk so low, who believes in the saving grace of Jesus Christ. In the end it is this, and his own raging conscience that bring him to justice.This is my second Dostoevsky novel, and I cannot say how much I enjoyed it. I don't even know where to start, I have so much to say - there's so much to mention, to bring to the table. However, I think I'll start Dostoevsky's incredible (almost super human) ability to create characters.Having read Dostoevsky before, I knew I was going to enjoy the characters. The characters in The Idiot stuck with me for a long time. In fact, as I write this, I can very clearly picture each character, what he/she was intended for in the story, and their personalities that are so impressioned into my mind. It is the same with Crime and Punishment. Raskolnikov's character alone is a masterpiece. His strange thought processes, his convictions, his awareness of all going on around him, his dilerium after he murders Lizaveta, and the new convictions that come about because of it all make up who he is and where he's going. As I started the book I wasn't as taken with him as I was Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, but as the story progressed and he changed, I felt a great attachment to him. While Myshkin was on the more talkative side, Raskolnikov was quiet, one who observes and reflects rather than speaks his mind. I felt sorrow for Raskolnikov because of the choices he made, but I loved him all the same as he tried his hardest to come to grips with the horrors of what he had done.Sonia's character is the more simple type, and a hard one to read about. After becoming a child prostitute at her step-mother's insistence, Sonia hates her life but continues living that way because her family needs the money. However, her simple and wonderful faith in Jesus Christ as a wretched sinner affects Raskolnikov in ways he cannot foresee at the time. Other characters in this story include Porfiry Petrovich, the police inspector, who, one word at a time, tries to squeeze the truth from Raskolnikov; Peter Petrovich, the fiance of Raskolnikov's sister Dunia; Marmeladov, Sonia's father; the mad Katerina Ivanovna, Marmeladov's wife; and Razmukhin, Raskolnikov's closest friend who wants to help and has a very innocent love for Dunia.Dostoevsky's writing is the next aspect that just gets me, in every way: his sentence structure, the way he describes scenes and objects, how he introduces characters...the purity of it all should be recognized for as long as books are in print. I felt this way about The Idiot and I feel it now. Dostoevsky's writing makes you feel as though you're reading a dream. If you've ever wondered what a dream would be like if you could read it, I'm convinced this is it. It's perfectly smooth, like you're floating; and yet his topics are real, his characters are lively and relatable, and above all his stories pierce you deeply with their symbolism and their cunning. If only every author used a bit of Dostoevsky's methods in their works... If only the stories spoke of real and often dreadful things but still permeated with the kind of hope and love we see here, this world would cease to exist as we know it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This should be on your reading list; it will make all of your other picks look not just thin but insignificant."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky plunges us deeply into the psyche of Raskolnikov, a 23-year-old detached law student, to demonstrate the moral underpinnings of human conscience, implicitly rejecting the anti-humanist philosophy of 19th century nihilists. Smitten by his own published yet untried nihilistic theories of the human condition, Raskolnikov premeditates the murder of a miserly elderly pawnbroker, who causes more suffering in the lives of common people than is justifiable by Raskolnikov's arithmetic reasoning (\\"one death, and a hundred lives in exchange\\"). In a sophomoric attempt to mimic the violent though celebrated deeds of heroes such as Napoleon, who courageously rose above the law in the name of social change, Raskolnikov bluntly murders the pawnbroker and her sister with an axe, fortuitously leaving behind no physical evidence linking him to the crime scene. However, haunted by a lingering psychosomatic delirium and feverish emotional turmoil in the aftermath of his otherwise \\"perfect\\" murder, Raskolnikov succumbs to internal psychological stress in the days following his crime. Soon enough, his stained conscience forces confession, setting the stage for \\"the gradual renewal of a man,\\" a Lazarusian revival of the soul.I read Crime and Punishment following its citation by a teacher during a recent discussion of Akutagawa's Rashomon, a 1915 short story set in 11th century Japan, brought to public attention again in 1950 by Kurosawa's film of like title. In the short story, a starving, unemployed man of low social rank implusively steals the kimono of a similarly impoverished old woman, exhibiting amoral behavior paralleling hers--the old woman has been stealing hair from corpses to make wigs to survive, and she explains her appalling thievery to the man by remarking that the dead woman, whose shriveled scalp the old woman is disgustingly plucking hairs from, also cheated people when she was living, by selling snake meat as fish, in order to eek a living in hard times. In essence, according to Akutagawa (who incidentally committed suicide at the early age of 35), morality is fraught with ambiguity, and one's own need to survive can justify deliberate, lowly, even amoral means.For Dostoevsky, the answer to moral ambiguity lies in personal choice. To resolve his psychological struggle with his own conscience, Raskolnikov faces a choice between a) the immediate path of suicide, as chosen, for example, by the enigmatically generous Svidrigailov, who takes his own life by gunshot after failing to win the affection of Dounia, Raskolnikov's sister, and b) gradual regeneration of the soul, by suffering through the humiliation of an extended public criminal trial and the ensuing drudgery of years in a Siberian labor prison. Encouraged by the compassion of Sonia, the 18-year-old harlot-by-circumstance daughter of a clerk-turned-drunkard whom Raskolnikov encounters in a tavern days prior to the murder, Raskolnikov's moral awakening enables him to admit his blunders, focus beyond his present suffering, and, together with Sonia, patiently await \\"the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life.\\"Apparently, then, Dostoevsky's message--reflective of his own life experiences, which included a period of incarceration and exile in Siberia (1849-1854) for membership in a liberal intellectual circle in autocratic mid-19th century Russia, and subsequent marriage to the wife of an acquaintance in Siberia after her husband's death--is that, not only do morals exist, but we also may choose to follow a moral path leading to eventual happiness and fulfillment, if we accept the interim punishment required to overcome our earlier moral missteps. Certainly, Akutagawa's cheating of customers, plucking hair from corpses, and stealing clothing are not so heinous crimes as Dostoevsky's premeditated double-murder, but both masterful literary creations disturbingly unsettle our emotions because, ultimately, like Raskolnikov, we humans cannot escape the inherent morality of our souls, even when our intellectual theories suggest otherwise."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky has crafted a monolithic work of literature in every respect here. This book contains all the elements of vintage Dostoevsky--unforgettable characters, a gripping plot, layers of meaning, captivating style and poignant sprinkles of humor. The book is broad in its scope, exploring numerous themes--alienation from society, criminal psychology, poverty, benevolence, confession, spirituality, redemption, love and more. As typical of Dostoevsky, however, it is the spiritual journey of one character that provides the central focus of the narrative. If you don't know much about Dostoevsky, I advise reading some about his life before beginning this novel (a good starting point is wikipedia.org/wiki/Dostoevsky). This novel will take you on a thought-provoking journey about the human heart and experience that you will not forget. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This review is a spoiler, so don't read it if you don't know how the book ends! But I want to focus on the ending--Tolstoy famously remarked of it that \\"once you start it, you immediately know how it will end.\\" And he was serious. And this sheds a great deal of light on this work and how it fits in with some of Dostoevsky's other masterpieces, such as the more restrained and better crafted Brothers Karamazov.Understanding Dostoevsky without Tolstoy is like understanding Levi-Strauss without Sartre. They were the two poles between which Russian literature was arraigned. They are treated as a binary opposition: the abstract vs. the concrete, the philosophical vs. the historical, the intellect vs. the soul, the symbolic vs. the sentimental.So how did Tolstoy know how it would end? Because the core of C&P;, as Tolstoy understood, was a Slavophilic call for a \\"return\\"--perhaps not a return to the land, but a return to orthodox Christian concepts and basic moral orderings. Since there is a cross-roads, one might as well kneel there. There is nothing else.So Tolstoy understood that once a crime has been committed, it ineluctably pushes the plot towards discovery, recognition and repentance. To have a plot break away from this would be either grasping for cheap effects or the grossest immorality, and no truly great Russian writer, no matter how philosophically inclined, could follow either of these paths.And yes, that does necessarily imply something sentimental. Because we are--as Dostoevsky beautifully says in The Brothers Karamazov--simple. (\\"As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.\\") Getting to the core of the matter will unveil simplicity--philosophy can get us to the point of throwing away false complications, but it cannot forever distract us from the fundamental simplicity of the opposition: right/sin.And yet, that is what most of us do--we use abstraction and symbolism to hold these simple truths at bay. When, like Raskolnikov, we find ourselves alone with our thoughts too much, these thoughts can seem more important than the simple issues of human life. Dwelling in a room in which he could reach out and touch opposite walls with each hand, the only expanse in which his soul could dwell was that of abstraction. (I know this feeling well, from living in a tent [see my review!] that was just about the size of his room, and with a substantially lower ceiling.) But no matter how you let your fancy fly, the chickens of violence always come home to roost.Perhaps because Dostoevsky was the one prone to symbolism, to craftiness as opposed to the rude directness that sometimes was the guiding impulse of Tolstoy's almost histrionic philosophizing, this admission of the fundamental Christian simplicity is truly moving. Dostoevsky is often considered a precursor of the existentialists but for very trivial reasons (e.g., serious mood swing issues). But one must see him as pursuing themes very similar to those of his rough contemporary Kierkegaard--can we free ourselves of excessive formal thinking and focus on the core issues of sin and repentance?I think the answer in both cases is actually no. Kierkegaard himself certainly couldn't [see my review!], and Dostoevsky was in some ways more of a ethnocentrist than Tolstoy. But more importantly, his characters only become in harmony with the world when they have some sort of lobotomy, not an enlightenment. He lacks the true sense of the emotional nature of repentance--something that occurs in humans who are by nature limited in their capacity to feel and comprehend--that we see in Tolstoy.I admit to being unusually interested in these themes. I've spent a long time repenting for a crime, even though it was, in the scheme of things, a minor one. No old ladies chopped, just some stretched--okay, false--testimony. But the reason for the crime was even more immoral than the crime itself. Too cowardly to just leave someone who loved me, I thought of an elaborate scheme to get her to reject me as too bothersome to put up with. Just the kind of thing Kierkegaard would do.Instead I found her, like Sonya in C&P;, clinging to me all the harder and shaming me with her decency, loyalty, and simplicity. And it is the character of Sonya that I find most perplexing. Her dogged insistence and her \\"sancta simplicitas\\" sometimes make her seem foolish (in contrast to the \\"wonderfulness\\" of Alyosha in the Brothers Karamazov, to whom she is often compared). She is friends with one of Raskolnikov's victims, Lizaveta, who is borderline retarded. (Here is also helps to compare to the Lizaveta in the Brothers Karamazov to get insight on what Dostoevsky is thinking.) It seems that there aren't too many viable options between stupid and bad. It's too Groucho Marx, but Raskolnikov on his way to Siberia must have wondered, \\"OK, I love you and you love me and that can be a form of redemption, or, maybe, it just means you are irredeemably stupid.\\" [45]"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The protagonist of this famous tale, Raskolnikov, has fallen to the depths of emotional and physical despair. Is there a way out of his abject poverty; a mind that will not shut off; his alcoholism; his fantasies of evil-acts, his utter Resentment of existence? In his mind, finally, there is hope, to bring his soul out from the gutter, an act of pure Will, that can lift him to a place where he is \\"meant\\" to be...and that is, pre-meditative Murder.It can be dangerous reading Dostoevsky because, as a writer, he has that uncanny ability to put the reader's mind into the mind of his characters.Reading Crime and Punishment, for me at least, had me agreeing with Raskolnikov, at times pushing him along to commit the act: commit murder because the writing had me truly believing that this most hidious act would bring him at least a glimmer of redemption. But, of course, after the 'act' (with an axe of all weapons), the guilt sets in and his life becomes even more a living hell. (Guilt is hell.)The paranoia of getting caught reaches mammoth levels, and he cannot live in his own skin anymore; in his mind he now IS in living hell.The protagonist finally admits to the crime and, comedically, (Dostoevsky's hate of any type of Russian bureaucracy) do not believe him!The most horrific scenes in literature of all time, for me, is the beating, on a busy street in St. Petersburg, of a horse by its sadistic owner to its slow and painful death. A beating that would turn anyone into a rage...This terrible image, so graphically written in detail, will remain with me forever.Does Raskolnikov finally attain his sought after redemption?There is something that changes within the man, but it is up to the individual reader to decide...one of the greatest books written in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is regarded as one of the best books of all time by many, but few people have actually read it. While I read it, I didn't let the hype that surrounded it cloud my thoughts about it. It is one of the most interesting books that I have read, going into the mind of its protagonist far deeper than any other novel. However, I found some of Dosteyevsky's themes and beliefs offensive, especially his stereotypical view of Germans as fools with thick accents. His knowlege of the human mind is amazing, though, as he writes about multiple personalities and the subconscious many years before they were first suggested by Freud. This book is definitely not for the casual reader, and is tough going for about 100 pgs in the middle, but readers who make it through will be rewarded with some of the best writing ever. Don't read it because of the hype, read it for its fascinating and completely unique view of the criminal mind and a look into the thoughts and beliefs of a very complicated author."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a moving story about sin, remorse, and partial redemption. Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was a master at character development and getting inside the souls of those he wrote about. This is the story of Raskolnikov, a destitute young student who decides to kill an old woman pawnbroker. The world would be better off without this old cheat, Raskolnikov decides in his self-appointed position as judge, jury and executioner. Of course, things don't go according to plan, and Raskolnikov ends up killing another person as well. The story then proceeds to Raskolnikov's conscience, the investigation, and the entry of other people into his life - including Sonya, a young woman forced into prostitution by economic necessity. Readers get a feel for city life in Czarist Russia circa 1866, plus its dire poverty and other problems.Russian literature can be difficult for English speakers, but this book is probably one of the easier works by Dostoyevsky (or other Russian novelist). This powerful tale of sin and redemption is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book when I was 13. I did not know nothing about russian literature and obviously never heard about Dostoevsky. Luckily, one day I found the book submerged in a sea of books in the bookseller, and the title &quot;crime and punishment&quot; impressed me. I read it without knowing I had in my hands one of the greatest and most profound novels ever. At the end I was so impressed by the clarity, depth and beauty of the characters, their monologues, the plot, everything, that I remember I said &quot;I won't find something like this again in my life&quot;, And could do nothing but admiring the author although didn't know nothing of him. Now three years later I've have already read this novel four times and I'm still marveled for the perfection Dostoevsky achieved in describing human pain, and divine hearts. Happily, I was wrong in what I had thought, because then, I discovered that this was not the only novel written by Dostoevsky."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You can tell a lot about a person by asking them what their favorite book is. I think most of us choose a book in which the protaganist reminds us of ourselves. Raskolnikov's experience of life was so similar to mine that I was swept away completely the first time I read Crime and Punishment. Intellectual vanity, alienation and isolation, do lead to a kind of madness. Although I cannot ascribe to Dostoevsky's political conservatism, his ideas regarding the necessity of suffering for salvation are totally convincing. The sweetness of Raskolnikov's eventual salvation through Sonya is in my opinion the pinnacle of literary romance."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the world in which we live, it is nearly impossibleto not reach a time in our lives when we feel that there isnothing. A time when we feel that all we have done inour lives was in vain and now we do not know what to do withourselves. In the novel Crime and Punishment by FyodorDostoevsky, a man by the name of Roskolnikov goes throughjust this type of phase.Roskolnikov finds himself lost. He feels that his lifeis leading him nowhere and he wants to do something about it.The measures he takes to acquire a state of peace are whatmakes this novel a masterpiece. He goes to such an extremeas to take another person's life just so he can feelimportant once again. That is the crime. The punishment,though, is not as clear. Almost the entire novel is hispunishment. Roskolnikov's punishment is the torture heundergoes as his mind slowly reaches insanity. The noveldelves deep into the mind of Roskolnikov as he reaches outfor others in the physical world to heal what he is feelinginside himself. From the moment he commits the crime he isstruck with a feeling of regret, and this feeling growsuntil it reaches the point of complete take-over of hisbody and mind.As in every Russian text, it can get confusing attimes because of the many names given to characters, andthe questionable points in the interpretation of the novel.Looking beyond this, though, one can see the genius of it asthe plot unravels and connections are made. The greatappreciation I have for this book comes from the fact thatit is simplicity at its finest. The world is a crazy place,and we must learn to cope with it as it comes along.Further reading:The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky;War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy;Fathers and Sons by Turgenev"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I used to find it incomprehensible that Raskolnikov could take such an extreme action based merely on a feeling of revulsion that he had toward the old woman.Then I got to noticing this fellow Patrick Cox on TV continually hawking the dubious services of his company for people in tax difficulty."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Brilliant book. I just got done reading \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and read the glowing reviews so I am writing this review just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.Also, how can people give this book 1 star? Are you kidding. Please stick with television if you think this book is anything but sublime."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This review is specific to the Garnett English translation, State Street Press audio edition (1991), narrated by George Guidall. I probably would have given this production/translation/work 3-1/2 stars if Amazon allowed, and the somewhat stilted Garnett translation is the primary reason I do not give it 4 stars.First, the translation: Usually a translator has to find some place between delivering accuracy of the meaning of the words with providing a sense of the artistry of the text in its original language. Garnett leans pretty far to the accuracy side, at the expense of the artistry of the language. Thus, one gets a very clear rendering of the story, but somewhat less of an idea of how it would 'sound' in the original Russian. There is a somewhat stilted feel to the language in this translation, but not enough to outweigh the value of an accurate rendering.Second, the narrator: Guidall does an excellent job of rendering the voices so many characters, and also delivering a complex and detailed narrative clearly and distinctly, at a pace that helps the listener stay with the story.I will not try to add to the large body of reviews of this work available on Amazon and elsewhere, except to challenge the reader to identify the point in the novel where the punishment in \\"Crime and Punishment\\" begins."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I had my doubts when I started this book. One problem I had was that I bought, what I later discovered, a really awful translation. Several times durring the story I felt myself thinking \\"oh common, lets move this along!\\" It seemed like yet another book where there is a main plot that deviates into several smaller plots along the way just to \\"beef up\\" the story. I wanted to give up. Fortunately, I'm pig headed and I kept with it to the very end, and I'm glad I did. Upon finishing the book I realized just how beatifully written it actually is. It's honestly a work of art. The development of the characters and the graphic descriptions are so fantastic that I really did lose myself in it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The title translated into German used to be 'Schuld und Suehne' which translates into 'Guilt and Attonement'. The book appears now with the new translated title of 'Verbrechen und Strafe' which translates into 'Crime and Punishment'. What was the author really thinking by almost excusing the crime? Are we now less forgiving?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is filled with characters who are all completely different from one another and who respect each others individuality. The one common bond they have is they see through the BS of the world, well at least some of the main ones do. Razumikhin and Raskolnikov are both young men who although students at the university choose to hang around everyday people and involve themselves with the passions, misgivings, and pain of the everyday man while also living for the moment to the point of extreme danger. How many of us that relate to Raskolnikov have the courage to admit we relate to him. I have never physically hurt someone badly, just some fights throughout my younger years most of which I was on the receiving end, let alone come close to murder but still I relate to his frustration with the world. I relate to the feeling of not one thing making it all hurt less. I also relate to being around people who debate, philosiphise and discuss everything under the sun while most are working or doing whatever the masses at that particular time in the world are doing. Art has the ability to play out scenes of the mind and see where they end up, this book does this all over the place. Art has the ability to do the things one would not have the courage to do but wonders about and wants to release that wonder in some way. Dostoevsky is timeless. I am not the type of person who likes putting people on any kind of pedastel and I feel like good old Fyodor sees the pitiful creatures we really are. Honesty is not always pleasant and his writings are that brutal honesty that makes one understand it all for a while at least. Evertime I am reading him someone asks me if I am reading it for class (I have not been in a class in many years). I would love to take a class where Dostoevsky is read. Reading someone who is a rebel straight up and down and speaks of drunkeness, murder, philosiphy, WHY, violence, hatred, mankind and on and on. Lucky people."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book because it is a classic, and I'm very glad I read it. At first I didn't like the book that much; the story is not that captivating. But wait until the last chapter -- it will truly knock you on your bottom! The book is a translation from Russian, so I often times found the language a little dull (or perhaps it was just straightfoward). I would recommend reading the last chapter of the book at least several times. It is here that Dostoevsky drives home an important point for humanity -- Jesus died for our sins, no matter how great they are. If we accept him in our hearts and repent, then we are cleansed and made new again. This is what Raskolnikov realizes at the end of the story, and thus the &quot;subject of a new story&quot; can imply his rebirth in Christianity. Looking back on that lesson, the book is worth the read, even if you have to trudge through it at times like I did."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A really facinating book. You will remember and think of all the bad things humans do and think. You will know alot better your soul. It's not an easy book but you will remember it forever."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Although it may take a few readings for one to understand its glory, Crime and Punishment is truly the greatest book ever written. I read it around three times a year(along with Dostoyevky's other work) and I always get something out of it. Fantastic...gripping...challenging. I marvel at how anyone can not give this book a 5 out of 5, or how anyone can call Shakespeare the greatest writer of all time. My only answer would be that some people are simply not ready to tackle some of the ideas presented in Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This novel is a psychological profile of a normal youth who becomes a murderer through convincing himself that he is above morality and social standards that apply to everyone else. He manages this by creating his own morality-the morality of a mentally disturbed individual.And the enviroment of a large city is most conducive to such a dark transformation;in fact, Dostoevsky recognizes the pernicious and assidious dangers that lurk in vast cities where individuals become faceless and are only noticed when they snap.I got the impression that Raskolnikov was merely searching for attention in a city that disregarded the poor and downtrodden, thereby intensifying his rage against those whom he despised already. The concept of this novel is not too original, but the way that concept is handled certainly proves that Dostoevsky was able to look into the human mind, as it underwent a transformation from normal to demented. He intelligently and artistically captures the smallest biological changes that accopanied his anti-heroes metamorphises.The side characters, I think, are left intentionally underdeveloped so as to allow maximum space for Raskolnikov's change. The profound observastion and artistic incompareability of this novel prove that Dostoevsky truly does deserve his place as the greatest writer of all time. The theme is not uncommon, but the masterful handling of it is. Anyone who likes whodunnits written by a true literary genius should read this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"An outstanding example of Russian Literature. Dostoevsky's ability to analyze and describe the workings of the human psyche is unequaled. He gives readers an understanding of how the mind of a criminal can rationalize and justify mans most base acts."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The above words were once applied to another revolutionary artist, Chopin, but apply equally to here. Both men have a searing intensity &amp; unflinching honesty that will leave you gasping. Dostoyevsky's greatness comes from the fact that he gives philosophical ideas a human face that we can empathise with (or rocoil in horror from). The question here is: can there be redemption from unspeakable acts. Roskolnikov murders for no reason, trying to rationalize his action saying it is for the common good &amp; later insisting he is beyond morality (shades of Nietsche). To the possibilty of redemption, Dostoyevsky answers yes, via Christianity. I say no. Read the book. Make up you own mind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It is about the crimes which are affected by societies.If you have some problems or some disagreements in your life ,it can't prevent your hearth from love..."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book for the first and only time when I was sixteen-I have since bought a new translation and I am waiting for the perfect time to reread it. This is one of the first major novels that I have ever read and Dostoyevsky has never let me down since. The book is a painting, and F.D. is a master-that is not disputed- but he is an uncommon master. This book is personal and intense, so early on there is a long letter from Raskolnikov's family-this man lives outside of himself, and within others, what a strange man. The book is like a piece by Mozart- not too long, not too short, with just the right amount of notes/words, and if just one piece is taken away, it is lost."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My name is Robert Engelberts from Voerendaal, The Netherlands, mailing from Sittard. I'm a young writer and warm admirer of Fyodor M. Dostoyewski. Since I still haven't read &quot;Brat'ja Karamazovy&quot; I won't rate this book ten... But it's awfully close to it... Who read Dostojewski's biography will know he wasa man imprisoned in the deadcell, waiting forexecution by a firepeloton... At the last moment(the riflemen were loading their guns) he wasgranted life... He wasn't executed, butsend him to a prisonerscamp no where elsethan in the midle of Siberia... So close was theworld to lose one of his greatest literarygeniuses... Who knows this, Dostoyewski'sbackground, will certainly want to knowwhat a man with this kind of life will write...Allthough with a dark look on the world,Dostoyewski is not without hope. Raskolnikov,suffering from guilt because of what he did,is being read from the Bible by his girlfriend:Jezus' resurrection of Lazarus... RaskolnikovCAN get a better man, there WILL be a wayfor him to live with the horrible thing he did...Just like in &quot;Poor People&quot; Dostyewsky's excently cappable of painting the misery and seemlingly hopeless lives of the poor... Of Rascolnikov who KNOWS he can do more, but isn't alloud by the society... The diabolic logic he uses to justify his crime.. And the akward loads of guilt he sufferes of after it...After reading this you should think C&amp;P is aboring, dark book about a man constantlytalking to himself about the &quot;bad things&quot; hedid... Far from it! Oh yes, Raskolniv does talkto himself - a lot as a matter of fact - but thebest Russian writer ever (couldn't we leavethat &quot;Russian&quot;?) knows very well thatstory = conflict: the protagonist intense wrestlingwith his infernal antagonist... Because of that C&amp;P can be read as a crimenovel with a whole lot of suspense to it... Just with a little more depth than Agatha Cristie."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is probably the last Dostoevsky book I'll ever read. Not because I disliked it (far from it), but simply because the damned thing took too long to read. Having spent weeks ploughing through only one of this dour Russian's novels, I'm not looking forward to starting any others, which look equally as formidable, especially when all lined up together on the bookshelf. For a while I'll limit my reading to the shorter classics. Guess I'll save &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; and &quot;The Executioner's Song&quot; for another day..."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dark works of art that dissect &amp; consciously contemplate the spaceless universe of the mind are bound to strike the most inherent interest in any individual that has the depth of a soul.What makes this masterpiece reward the readers zest of curiosity is the near accuracy of its foundations &amp; the plot that brilliantly weaves from it.The atmosphere is tense throughout,&amp; even in moments of Raskolnikov's quiet contemplation an eerie sense of relief pervades through like a public park sullen &amp; silent in dismal gray after a showerstorm.The characters truly have a life of their own,characters who are real in every motion &amp; thought which the prose breathes into in spellbinding accuracy.The scene where Raskolnikov dreams of a horse being brutally murdered by a bunch of drunks &amp; jeered by the town square with the horse struggling for life step by step,inching for dear life oblivious to every blow which weakens his battered but undampened spirit slowly laying on the mud of his acceptance is one of the most moving &amp; dramatic portrayals of realism in all of literature which left me to countless tears unable to restrain.This has been one of the best books I have ever read,just as thrilling &amp; exciting as the &quot;Godfather&quot; but more profound,&amp; the final scene presents solemn redemption to a life that has been simply denied of such."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is my all time favorite book.

It is an intense Russian Classic without the 4-digit page numbers."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"What's most fascinating about Crime and Punishment that I have not read in the other reviews here is that Dostoyevski has the incredible ability to make the reader feel true empathy for the main character while simultaneously experiencing disgust, pitty and at times extreme frustration. The setting is bleak beyond reality, yet the author creates a a world in which the reader can smell the the dank, desperation of alcoholics, lost souls, and those who have completely given up hope, yet accept their lot in life without taking recourse against their oppressors, except,of course, R. The late 1800s in Russia was a very harsh, lonely and fearful place to live. In light of the tragic life that Dostoyevski himself lived, this work of art all the more important. In many ways he's been in R.'s shoes."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Only after the dust settled did my psyche follow suit. This masterpiece delves into every sentient sphere: at once prompting laughter, commiseration, and angst. Had I not read it, I would be at considerable loss in ever grasping what it means to eat oneself alive."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a heart-wrenching novel about a man lost in his own theories. As a Napoleon, a superior to those &quot;ordinary fools&quot;, he feels he has the right and motive to kill an old woman money-lender and free himself from poverty. The hideous guilt that builds up and somewhat destroys the young man's soul creats a web of intimacy and tension. This novel haunts and disturbs. How can a murder be justifiable? This one is.If you're a sensitive and easily frustrated person, I do no recommend this book to you. Dostoyevesky's depiction of this murder from the opening pages thrills the reader to a somewhat unbearable degree."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In this book Dostoyefsky actually mananges to get into the mind of a man who is slowly going mad. As he examines his personal philosophies and how they clash with his conscience, you are given such an astonishing view of this mans tormented thoughts---sometimes it makes you want to scream out loud as you suffer with him in his indecision. Most of the action is internal and will prbably seem boring to those who favor action."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book plunges one into the depths of despair, making one realize how colourful one's own life really is. To be Raskalnikov would be like living in hell. Dostoyevsky is a genius, capable of so skillfully exploring the human physche."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is not for everyone. If you are into a book that analyzes a murder and the psychology of the man after he committs the murder then there is no better book in the world, but if you want to read an action packed entertainment novel then this is not for you. I suggest picking up a Tom Clancy novel. My overall review is that this is a mind boggling journey through a murderers inner deamons and the final peace that he finds in the end."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When I first picked up this book, I assumed the title defined the story in the \\"classic\\" sense - a criminal committed some henious act and was sent to prison, where the bulk of the tale would be told. I expected a look at a Russian prison in the 19th century, but I was surprised by the content.Dostoevesky, who was sent into exile in Siberia, wrote a pyschological thriller - long before the genre of 'thriller' was ever invented. Rather than focusing on the criminal's time in prison, he focused on the criminal's mindset and the intellectual torture that he put himself through. Rodion Raskolnikov, a young man, was a murderer; he killed two women; one intentionally, the other only a victim of circumstance. Raskolnikov then struggles with the crime he has committed and tries to explain to himself why he should (or should not) confess to the crime. During his neurotic episodes, we meet unforgettable characters such as Porfiry Petrovich of the police department, who (in my opinion) probably was the basis for the modern day Detective Columbo of television fame. Porfiry has a way of asking questions that force Raskolnikov to think about his crime and nearly leads him to break down. Even though Raskolnikov never confesses to Porfiry, the two men develop quite an intriguing relationship, one that fascinates the reader for many pages.I think I could go on & on about with praise and quips from this book, but if I did my review would be a hundred pages long and might dissuade people from reading it. Don't read this just because it has been tagged with the label \\"classic\\" by every modern publisher. Read it becuase it is a thrilling, page turning, escape into 19th century Russia and the psychological thoughts of a killer who believes he has killed because he is \\"above the law\\". Great book - wish I'd read it many years ago!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The first 100 pages and the last 100 pages are impeccable. But whats in between is un-needed informtion pretaining to the story."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is a good high school read and I'm still enjoying reading this novel! Thanks to betterbooks I got a great price on this book.Getting this book for a cent was not a crime and reading it is defiantly not a Punishment, it is an engaging selection to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is, at surface and in heart, a psychological investigation into the mind of a man who commits a crime - a crime he feels justified in doing - but ultimately, a crime he fails to reconcile. As a student, the protagonist (a man named Raskolnikov) is well versed in the philosophical theories of his day, and has even written a published paper - specifically on the idea of the 'extraordinary' man. Raskolnikov's 'extraordinary man' is tantamount to Nietzsche's 'superman,' in that both represent a man of the modern era: The godless man, the man who suffers not from pangs of morality or conscience but is able to shape his will and coerce the world into supplication. There are other factors that fuel Raskolnikov's motives; he is impoverished, he is indebted to his family to be their savior...but still, he seems to cite his 'theory' most of all - and indeed, the novel, to a great extent, deals with the incompatibility between his theory on paper and its practical application. More obtusely, what happens when the incalculable nature and conscience of a man is entered into an otherwise elegant equation or theory? Dostoyevsky portrays the protagonist as not only a typical man, but an overly generous one...someone who partially justifies his act as not only beneficial to himself, but also, to the good of humanity. This is where the idea of the 'extraordinary man' and the main character diverge, as the protagonist observes the affects of his action on his surroundings, friends, and loved ones. Perhaps if Raskolnikov were more rational, cold, or calculating, he would have been able to murder without conscience, succeed in his theory and plan - the author seems to suggest - at the same time proposing that such men are, if not impossible, very unlikely. There is much to the book besides this idea however, and often the narrative focuses on other characters or strays into sub-plots to further illustrate minor points or arguments...or just to tell an interesting story, for this work is nothing if not entertaining. It is also interesting to note that, at the end of the novel, and be warned this is something of a spoiler, the protagonist reaps inadvertent benefits that otherwise would not have come to pass...as beauty from ugliness, light from darkness, ect. This is a very good novel, and Dostoyevesky is adept at obscuring his point, so much so that the novel lends itself to a wide variety of interpretations (some of which are cited at the end of the Pocket Books edition.) As far as the translation and notes go, they serve their purpose and the narrative remains clear to the English reader. There are however, a few phrases in German and French that receive no notes, but you can ascertain their meaning from the context."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is a must read for them who love literature and to find out why he was called the writer of the writers.This piece of work proves it again as well as his other master works do.Its a work which creates a reflection so clear and yet so sophisticated that it stays with you as long as you are travelling in the world of art.Its so detail and its every inch depicts so much.Dont just read it, try to absorb it.you will find the glory."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My interest in this volume was initially piqued by the fact that Sidney Monas was my \\"Russian Intellectual History\\" professor at UT-Austin in Spring 1982. Seeing his translation of Dostoyevsky's famous book on the shelf at the University Co-op, I had to swoop it up.And the result? Ultimately, it affected my life enormously. Without that chance occurrence, I likely wouldn't have become Orthodox, learned classical Greek, or made Russian History my outside field in grad. school at UVA, or Eastern Christianity my non-history field.This great book -- and unlike most readers, I consider it Dostoyevsky's (my favorite author's) greatest book -- is worthy of reading on several different levels. It is simply a great crime story. It is a wonderful philosophical statement. It has amazing theological insight. It takes William Gilmore Simms' invention -- the narrative told from inside the protagonist's head -- about as far as that 19th-century discovery can be taken.Read this book for the fun of it. Read it for the art of it. Read it for the insight it offers. Read it to find out what Christian salvation means; no other work of fiction does a better job of explaining that."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fantastic work of russian literature that truly delved solely into the minds of a criminal and got me to love Russian authors such as Turngev and others of the sort.

This was my first novel by Dostoevsky but it won't be my last. Crime and Punishment may be the most gripping novel I've ever read, and I didn't just read the story... I consumed it voraciously. I was mesmerized, enthralled, anxious, and confounded at times. Even that was good and a part of the reading experience.It's true that it takes some work to read Dostoevsky, but it's worth the effort. He has a style all his own. I had to re-read certain passages multiple times to understand fully the scope of a particular conversation or event, as the author intended. However, the process for me was never tiresome; I wanted to soak in every detail.I won't rattle on about the story itself -- others have already done that here, and probably more effectively than I could do anyway. Let me just say that the premise of the novel is compelling, the characters are first-rate, and the ever-crumbling dynamics between Raskolnikov and his friends and family are painfully realistic. The reader gets a bird's-eye view into the innermost workings of an agonizingly conflicted mind.For me, Crime and Punishment was a profound and satisfying reading experience, one that will stay with me forever. This isn't so much because of the subject matter or the \\"moral of the story\\", which warns against over-intellectualizing and getting swept up in the social thinking of the day. No, what I liked best was how the author got me to care intensely about almost every character in the story.I know now why author Michael D. O'Brien (Sofia House, Father Elijah) was influenced by Dostoevsky, and why he is often compared favorably to the Russian storyteller."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Almost painful in it&#8216;s account of human self examination and the loathing of finding out who we might or might not be."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This took me a long time to read. I stopped and started. There are three or four brain searing scenes where the madness of the central character comes to the fore. For these, the book is worth reading. I found the rest a bit tedious - perhaps a modern translation would increase connection with the material. Also, I didn't like any of the characters enough to care about the eventual outcome, which made it more difficult to wade through the slow bits.I feel like a philistine for saying so, but losing track of the names probably didn't help either - given names, patronymics and nicknames for everyone, so sometimes I'd get halfway through a scene before connecting some of the participants to their back stories. Perhaps that wouldn't have been so bad had I finished it quicker.In the end, everyone is flawed, no-one escapes tragedy, and we define our own punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have not read this book as of yet .

Do not be intimidated by the complicated Russian names, you can eventually identify the characters. For me, the first chapter was a little hard to get into, but as I plugged along, I quickly grew into it and it is indeed a fascinating page-turner, a story where you can really get into the characters mind. A great read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In reviewing Rodian Rasloknikov's character, I am surprised for someone so smart and a generally okay guy can murder with such resolve and then agonize slowly over it.He was a narcissist with exhibited signs of schizophrenia. His sickness was fighting with the rational and righteous man in him. It was an amazing journey into the mind of a tortured soul in these days of Prozac and Paxil....I was told I should read it in the original Russian. I think I'll pass. I already know how depressing it is."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Interesting, first Dostoyevsky novel for me. Human nature...it's all in there, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Depends on your point of view as to which you ascribe to each character. It was a good read, although a little difficult for me, as my son comitted suicide in January."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The book I ordered was in the exact condition as described and item was shipped to me promptly!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov, Crime and Punishment's protagonist, is a divided man (his name literally means \\"split\\" in Russian). On the one hand, he is an uber-Mensch, an intelluctual who feels entitled to take life into his own hands without regard for the consequences. On the other, he is a compassionate and caring man, trying to protect his sister Dounia and offering a helping hand to an impoverished drunk. Raskolnikov is always at odds with himself, and the two facets of his character are highlighted through Sonia, the moral prostitute, and Svidrigailov, the despicable intellectual. Usually, crime is the most fascinating aspect of a story. Here, the crime is over with rather quickly. Dostoyevsky's true genius is how he paints the character of Raskolnikov post-crime: a tortured soul wrestling with the concept of guilt and what it means to be redeemed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book really puts me on the edge as I sympathize with the main character over his misfortune, agonize with him over his actions, fearful of his punishment that seems inevitable, despairing over the repercussion it will have on his family and loved ones, all the while, hopeful that things will workout somehow and that all is not lost. It's like watching a disaster happen slowly before my eyes without the power or the will to stop it.The writing style, character and plot development are all perfect. The only thing I'd complain about would be that the book started off with an interesting moral debate over \\"If you can kill one bad person but save many innocent, should you do it?\\", but that was left hanging as the main character no longer concerns himself with this philosophical debate. But then again, it maybe better left to a different book as it was more of a catalyst for the plot and not meant to be a center piece."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Book ReviewI don't feel I have the authority to make judgment on such a classic. But I can say that I loved Crime and Punishment, and that it has earned a spot as one of my all time favorites. Constance Garnett's translation was a nice, smooth read. Also I really liked the illustrations in this copy.Dostoevsky borrows some interesting and possibly dangerous philosophies, and personalizes them through a smart young student, Raskolnikov. Like most in Petersburg, Raskolnikov is stuck in the stranglehold of poverty, and also suffers from delusions of self-superiority.I grew to love Raskolnikov and without realizing, I began to root for and sympathize with a cold blooded murderer, whom any normal person wouldn't hesitate to condemn. By the time you have finished the book, you will have gained a unique view of what crime and punishment is, and what it can be.I could recommend this book to anyone and be confident that they will like it if they give it a fair chance. The first 90 pages or so are kind of slow, but after that you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is an excellent translation of the Dostoevsky classic. The quality of the audio is also top notch. While listening to this story I found myself feeling like I was right there as this version does a great job of immersing the listener in 18th Century Russia. I would highly recommend this version of the classic for anyone looking to explore the world of Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov, the main character in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, is presented as a pure nihilist. Dostoevsky, through his telling of Raskolnikov's inner struggle and his first encounter with love and compassion, is clearly rejecting nihilism. The murder committed by Raskolnikov might be an act related to utilitarianism, but the great agony and guilt that the main character suffers is Dostoevsky's idea of real punishment that leads the final conclusions that good beats evil, religion beats atheism, and right overpowers wrong.Granted, Crime and Punishment is considered great literature devoted to the psychology of criminals and their imprisonments within their own guilt. However, the novel is an immature way of stereotyping criminals and simplifying a very complex human puzzle. Dostoevsky attempts to show us that only love, redemption and righteousness will rule, but he over simplifies and generalizes.Crime and Punishment is another way that Dostoevsky tried to resolve his feelings about chaos and corruption in his society, and solve all dilemmas and conflicts by turning to God, or accepting Christ as Dostoevsky did in reality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You can read everything you need to about the book from the other reviews, so I'll examine an interesting aspect of this book a little further.I agree with one (perhaps many) of the reviewers that Crime and Punishment should not be read purely as a philisophical treatise. The concepts are not planted and gone to seed in this book; Dostoevsky seems to be showing the result of an idea like this (hence the name Crime and Punishment rather than The Greater Man) rather than the conceptual processes of the idea itself.Raskolnikov (the so-called perpetrator) never accepted redemption because he never believed that he had commited a crime. Society (as he thought) was persuing him to exact justice. Supposing that his reasoning (that the difference between social acceptance and even greatness and PUNISHMENT is success or defeat) is correct, why does his family and friends continue to accept him? He failed; \\"society\\" was against him, but he had friends the whole time. Even Porfiry (I forget his full name) said that he \\"liked\\" him, and the man that was after Dounia (lol) said that they were \\"the same type of person.\\" Evem Razmuzihin, who lives, it appears, simply for justice did not prosecute his friend. Who is the greater man? These people let him off; the Explosive Lieutenant was agreeable even though he had once submitted to the suspicions surrounding Rodya: Is there such a thing as a great crime? Is the crime defined in the eyes of the people or the eyes of the criminal? I guess, in that case he's right!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book in about 12 days, which is rare for me. I really liked the characters and the flow of the story.

One classic down, only a few hundred to go:)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book has some of the best police interrogation scenes that I have ever read. You realy enjoy to see him get interrogated because it is so heated and passionate. But the only problem with the book is that you spend so much time trapped in his head reading about even the most mundane thoughts that you get so bored that you ache for a more suspenseful scene. The ending is quite fitting and interesting to read so the book does leave you with a satisfying feeling of reading a good book after you have finished."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This Dostoevsky Classic is about a young man named Raskolnikov. He is a young man living in St.Petersburg, Russia who is struggly financially. He lives in run down apartments in a bad part of town. Raskolnikov believes that his natural superiority places him above the moral law of common men. With that, he finds good reason for murdering two men. All through the novel, each reason is found to be insupportable. Raskolnikov starts to feel a lot of guilt for what he has done and cannot even spend the money obtained by the crime. Finally he turns himself in and is sentenced to hard labor in Siberia. Siberia is a very cold part of Russia. Raskolnikov soon begins to discover that what he did was wrong and he tries very hard to make up for it.I would recommend this book, but you really have to know how to understand that way it's written. There are a lot of hard words and complicating phrases. You also have to push yourself to read this because some parts can begin to get very boring at times but don't let that stop you because this is a great book!!!!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Whoa! Look out, this one's scary!! Just kidding. Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is a dark or noirish story of Rodian Raskolnikov's journalist life. He's portrayed as some what of a &quot;wishy-washy&quot; main character/protagonist who lives his life in the attempt to do good. However, since he lives in bleak times and is under pressure (he's the early form of manic depression) Rodya takes out his aggression on his old pawnbroker and her sister so to speak. The story takes form as Rodya attempts to hide the truth about his ax-murdering tendencies through his good deeds. Functionally, Dostoevsky's piece is very long winded. Many scenes are drawn out to the point of monotony and yet others go by almost too fast as the reader gets involved in the story. My views of this piece would go as far as to say, &quot;It's a dark film noir thriller of the 19th Century...&quot; and I emphasize the 19th Century.Thematically, the piece is very melodious, bits and pieces coming together slowly. Metaphor and imagery are used extensively to show a dark side of life in the late 1800s Russia. Symbolism is rich but story line lacks any great coherence.But enough of that, What is it? You might ask... Well, simply put, Crime and Punishment is a story about a man on a mission of redemption through his acts and the way he treats people. Rodya is truly sorry for the things he's done but at the same time isn't very remorseful of the deaths. It's a hard read, no doubt, but is it worth it? I should say, if you like thriller novels and don't think you'd have a hard time with this one, go for it! Dostoevsky very readily set about to write a story with his biblical-bashing background and did indeed manage to pull it off again. His characters are very proud and very emotional, and even though its and older piece, its worthy of a little more scrutiny."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I don't have time to go into the intricate level of detail and character development that Dostoevsky himself did when writing this novel. All that is left to say is that there is a distinction between whether you \\"like\\" this book and whether this book is \\"good/well written.\\" You are more than welcome to not enjoy this book, but don't think for a second that you can blame your dislike on Dostoevsky. He wasn't writing it for you, and that's okay. This book a pure literary genius, and to confuse subjective dislike with objective quality is a mistake that Dostoevsky himself would never make."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The first 50 pages of this novel are as gripping as anything Stephen King writes."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I had to read this for a college course, personally I enjoy reading and so the length wasn't a problem. I want to clear out, that it is true that after the crime, the novel is mainly anti-climatic, but Dostoevsky is describing what his anti-hero (Raskolnikov) justifies his crime. Raskolnikov afterward tortures himself in his thoughts, thinking about what other people should be thinking, therefore, it is him who is punishing himself. I loved the plot, and the reality in all of it, even the drunkard's conversations where lengthy and boring, just as if you were sitting with the drunkard and thinking to yourself \\"just shut up, or get to your point already!\\"The novel is very realistic, and ahead of his time. There is a comparison in an article I read as a research of the novel, where it says that Raskolnikov can be compared in thoughts and actions of Marquis de Sade, and in contrast Sonya represents the thoughts of Dostoevsky himself regarding Sade's anti-humanity"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I picked up this novel as part of the Easton's top 100 books. I have to admit that I wouldn't have read it, or finished it, if it wasn't part of this list. It follows the deterioration of Rasko, a poor student, who decides to murder a pawnbroker in an attempt to better his life. This go awry from the beginning, when in a state of panic he forgets to bolt the door. After committing the murder, he takes a handful of trinkets. Rasko is immediately wracked by guilt, and begins making mistake after mistake.The novel was probably considered a psychological thriller when it was initially published. However, I found it to be a bit dry and hard to read. Oftentimes characters would go on non-sensical rants that lasted several pages. I found the moral questions raised throughout the book to be interesting. A more modern take on this book would probably be interesting and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Being Dostoyevsky an observer of the inner world that comes out of the perceptions of the mind, this novel is about the ravings of a poor helpless University Student drop out who happens to rent a cramped one room studio in San Petersburg, Russia. He needs money desperately and one day decides to kill and old nasty lady who makes her business pawning objects and to whom he had pawned some jewelry belonging to his mother.The book can be divided in my opinion in three parts, 1) All the process that leads to the murder of the lady as seen from the inside of the mind of Raskolnikov ( this poor innocent that would never kill a fly, planning to murder someone)these few chapters are colorful, full of suspense action and very gripping indeed like in the best hard boiled novel you can find 2) Intermediate chapters that plod along describing the environment where Raskolnikov lives showing the social reality of the Tzarist Russia of that time and 3) How Raskolnikov reveals his crime to the outside, gets convicted, put on trial and sentenced. In every case Dostoyevsky does not focus on the story but in the feelings and emotions that go through the mind and soul of the characters as they interact among themselves like in the best psycho fiction novel and this carries along the action unfolding the story. In order to understand and properly follow this author one must reflect himself on every sentence one read so as not to lose the thread. So do it slowly. Crime and Punishment is a classic worthy to read"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a beautifully woven psychological tale that I found very hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase.

So I thought let's try this CD as she listens to books-on-CD during her commute - well it worked and she loved the CDs and said it was like the speaker was acting out the parts not merely reading them, so it clearly deserves 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky is one of the best. Some people get a little lost with his philosophy but I find him very insightful. Often I see his ideas in todays movies and TV shows.

I read this book twice."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I bought this book at the airport on my way to Russia convinced that I would read it while in St. Petersburg. My plans fell apart because I didn't have enough time and the beginning couldn't hold my attention.However, I kept it, still meaning to give it another go, especially after gaining a deep appreciation and love for anything Russian. In my honors english class we read it this year and I found it an immensely stirring physcoanalysis of the criminal mind. While slow in the beginning Dosoevsky quickly made up for it with his riveting character developments. You quickly grew a strange compassion for Raskolnikov, despite the fact that he was a murderer. This is the skill of the writer.While many would argue Raskolnikov did not recieve proper punishment, I think his mental anguish and agony was almost enough. Dostoevsky painted a rather disturbing picture of the mindset that a murder can set you into.This translation surprised me. Before I read this book in class, I read a poorly translated version of the Death of Ivan Ilyich. By comparing this translation to that I was easily sucked into the book.Get through the first 50 pages and the book is simply riveting, take my word for it. I can't wait to read it a second and a third time."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Despite other reviews that comment on the poor translation of this book. I found it to be fairly good and not affect the reading at all, and it has a great introduction (that I suggest reading after you finish the book because it has great ideas, but gives away the ending). As for the book itself, it isn't to deep and almost anyone should be able to understand it fully. It is almost more of a character study but the plot does move along quite nicely and the book is hard to put down once you get into it, and like all Russian authors there is some philosoph yin this book, but it is laid out for you very simply. As for only giving it 4 stars, I just felt that it wasn't as great as it could have been (since he was writing it for money above anything else)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment, while at times a bit boggled down by the affairs of minor characters, is a powerful novel. The character, a murderer, is incredibly three-dimensional and true to life. His personal suffering makes you feel sorry for him, to the point in which you wish him free from jail. Fyodor's personal philosophies are sprinked all throughout the novel as well, and are a bonus to the already masterful work.A deep novel that remains one of the greatest works of prose ever written."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have heard of this book for years but did not think I would like it. I got it in a lot of books I bought cheap and decided to give it a try. It is the translation by Magarshack and is highly readable. What a great story! It has a little of everything: crime, social commentary, feminism, romance, intrigue, comedy, ethnicism, class wars and religion. I could not put it down! The main character murders a couple obnoxious women for their money, believing at first that he is doing society a favor, and later is tortured by guilt. Throughout several subplots, many different types of people are drawn into his life with varying degrees of intrigue and he tries desperately to hide what he has done in the midst of all of this. There is a lot of dialogue in this book but it is interesting and engaging; one is drawn into the lives of the characters and feels like they are in the room with them.Please don't bypass this one because of its age and being a \\"classic\\". How refreshing to read an intellectual, well-written book!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I liked this slightly better than The Brothers Karamozov which is also one of the best books ever!

You murdered her, and then you murdered her sister. What were you thinking?Raskolnikov: (Making a violent effort to understand what it all means) I murdered myself, not them! It was the Devil that killed them. Enough, enough! I killed a noxious insect of no use to anyone, so what is the object of these senseless sufferings?Dr. Phil: You need to get a grip on yourself, and you need to take some responsibility and make healthier choices.(Applause from studio audience.)Raskolnikov: (Breathing heavily, his upper lip twitching.) My choice was to be a great man dedicated to improving the lot of humanity. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some mysterious process to bring into the world at last one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.Dr. Phil: Let's talk about the independence thing, since you brought it up. You're still receiving money from your mother, isn't that right? And you have a college degree but no job? And recently you've embarked on a life of crime?Raskolnikov: The extraordinary man has the right to find in his own conscience a sanction for murder, if it is essential to the practical fulfillment of his idea. Our rulers destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels.Dr. Phil: Ho ho, well I'm not an expert on politics, but don't you think you have enough problems of your own to keep us busy here?

(Laughs insanely.) Perhaps I am really mad, and all this happens only in my imagination.Dr. Phil: Nope, you ain't getting you off the hook that easy. Fact is, you are accountable for your actions. What I'm asking you to do is take responsibility. Are you willing to give that a try?Raskolnikov: (Bows down to kiss the earth.)

The story focuses on Raskolnikov, a former student who is separated from his society beacuase of his pride. Raskolnikov killed Ivanovna for certain reasons and also her sister who witnessed the crime.The novel focuses more on the psychological state of Raskolnikov after the crime including his doubt, guilt and despair. the novel also shows how raskolnikov is a nihilist and a utilitarian in nature. He kept pushing help from other people. His guilt is haunting him even in his dreams. and the police officers are having an idea that he's the murderer.St. Petersburg is the setting. It actually helped me a lot to guess what will happen next. It also creates the mood of the story. The city somewhat contributed to the excitement of the story.The novel was good. It shows that no one can live alone. And eventhough Raskolnikov kept pushing away the help of his family and friends, Sonya eventually breaks the barrier through her love between Raskolnikov and the society.The novel is a requirement in some schools &lt;like ours> and we are forced to read this kind of thing. But through a lot of readings i eventually understand what the book is all about. How pride separated him from the society. how nihilism developed in Raskolnikov's personality and how he accepts to be part of the society again. Now this book is a very worthwhile book for me. and i guess this is the start of my reading of other books of this kind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The sensation this book may give you is that of a nightmare. True to nightmares both the reader and the protagonist eventually wake up. I guess there are many different things that people can take away from such a classic piece, not least of which is the concept of redemption. Although not religious, Raskolinov reaches the point where he can either melt down completely or come clean and pay for his sins.Still, the greatest accomplishment in my opinion was in creating a mood so successfully it almost seemed to affect my physical surroundings."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky writes a fine book about killing and the consequences of it (not societal, but moral). The main character Raskolnikov becomes the perfect abstraction of the neurotic man, who suffers from a malady whose source he knows not, grappling in the darkness, searching, amidst a void without clarity, without purpose and whose only redemption lies in confession, in humility.Thus Dostoyevsky blends Existentialism with Christianity in this novel, and makes a fine book. Although, I still prefer the Nietzschean interpretation to the problem of life, in that, the problem of morality lies not in our actions, but in our conscience.Also recommended: Toilet: The Novel by Michael Szymczyk (A tribute to the Literary Works of Franz Kafka)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment was an excellent book and I recommend it for any high school level reader (11th and 12th grade) or higher. It is great literature, but is confusing at some points. If the reader tries to understand the book page by page, it is sometimes hard to put the book down. The book also helps you learn a little about the history of Russia during the 19th century after Napolean and his troops froze to death trying to defeat the Russians.Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoy lives a life of poverty. He seems to be crazy to the reader because he murders two sisters. His reasoning was based on the theory he wrote. Rodion feels uncomfortable whenever the subject of murder is brought up in a conversation. Although he believes his reasoning for killing the two girls was correct, he seems to still be uncomfortable about it showing he is partially innocent.As the story moves on, tension builds because the reader does not know what will happen next.This book is great to read if you are a high school level reader or higher.

As it turned out, I picked it up again. This book can be gory and even boring, and the main character is a murderer, and yet something about the depth of emotion in it kept me reading it.In most modern novels I've read the author tries too hard to show the characters emotions by spelling it out for you. And it comes across mediocre. Dostoevsky doesn't make that mistake, the raw emotion is mostly implied by physical reactions and leaves you to fill in the feeling yourself, almost like a good movie, I think that's one of the things that held my interest."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I usually wont give a review a 5 star because there is always something to improve. But this book is what Literature is at its best. Dostoyevsky is truly an artist. I used to be a big reader but it died out with me. After reading this book I am hooked again. This book offers everything one could ask for. There are scenes that you refuse to put the book down and the airs on your arm stand up from excitement. You feel for Raskolnikov and want him to get away for his crime. This book offers a total change in a persons humanity.

While the reading is slow and bogged down at certain points, the overall psychological effect is worth the read.This book loses 1 star because the author went in later and added a last chapter that doesn't fit at all with the tone and theme of the main character and overall book flow. The chapter attempts to address redemption in a very Christian type of way, but simply reads as a square peg in a round hole. This was the first time I ever read a book and got visibly mad because of the forced and artificial ending.Read this book, skip the last chapter.A Clockwork Orange has a similar problem also."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first started this novel during my senior year of high school. I only now, over a decade later, picked it up again and finally finished it. I am glad I waited. Dostoyevsky's classic novel is worth the more serious treatment of a voluntary read. Dostoyevsky uses a young, nave protagonist to explore the nature of conscience and morality and take a rusty axe head repeatedly to the skull of the nihilism sweeping Russia at the time.Raskolnikov is an impoverished, depression-prone college dropout living in Petersburg. Crime and Punishment was published in 1866 and takes place contemporaneously. Desperate for money and convinced that some people (including Napoleon and, not surprisingly, himself) are above moral prohibitions on harming others, Raskolnikov decides to kill a miserly pawnbroker. He rationalizes that the benefit to the world from the good the money will allow him to do more than outweighs the harm to the world from the death of the old woman.The bulk of the novel focuses on Raskolnikov's inner turmoil and tortured emotional journey after the murder. Raskolnikov's sister, his friend, and the daughter of a man he met by chance see him through his despair. It has to be incredibly difficult to write a novel without action to use as a crutch, but Dostoyevsky does so masterfully. This novel will leave you thinking long after you put it down and has made it on to the short list of novels that I can point to as forming an important part of my personal philosophy (The Orchard Keeper by Cormac McCarthy is another).One word of warning: the English translation produced a readable prose, but Russian naming conventions remain and a single character will be referred to by several different names at different times.My edition was translated by Constance Garnett and includes an introduction by Joseph Frank that discusses Dostoyevsky's process in writing it and tries to give it a context within the Russia of that time."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There has been so much review of Crime and Punishment, my thoughts hardly count - nonetheless, I'll throw my tidbits into the stew. No spoiler information.I'll also add that I read this on Kindle. (I've found that I still prefer paper books, but this download was free). The venerable Constance Garnett translation. With the exception of one or two repeated words, and an instance of a gibberish sentence, I found the version flawless.The story is about a mentally unbalanced young man, who plans and commits a robbery/murder (that's the crime, and yes, he is eventually punished). If Camus' story of \\"The Stranger\\", rates an \\"F\\" (which is what I awarded it), then this cousin on the same theme with many similarities earns a glowing \\"A\\".The tale is complexly woven with a head-spinning network of characters, design, and happenstance. The Russian names were a bit confusing at first. I learned to deal with them. I also dealt well with the complex little world around Rodion, the villain/protagonist (choose your title) of the story. The insights into the thoughts of people is remarkable.I am not formally trained in how to appreciate literature, but I know what I like. After a little effort in getting used to this Russian classic, it turned into a page turner for me. I looked forward to picking it up each sitting. Trying to examine it deeper, I saw that beyond the obvious issue of the crime and punishment concerning Rodion and the murder - there was demonstration of deed and results for most of the characters in the book: drunks, child molesters, diligent poice officers, loving family and friends, greedy misers, et al. Much of the time, they seemed to \\"get what they deserved\\".Not as long as some of Tolstoy's epics, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" seems a good entry choice into Dostoyevsky and great Russian literature."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You're probably looking at this for a class assignment. Go into it with an open mind. It's one of my favorites, and I don't read all that often."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Only through great suffering comes wisdom and enlightenment.That is one of the many themes in Crime and Punishment.Written by Dostoevsky after his time in exile in Siberia where he was serving a sentence in the Katorga camps (a system of forced labour camps that preceded the Gulag), the story follows the young Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (a student of law) after he commits murder. The story details his mental and physical anguish of his secret and his attempts to justify his actions.The novel unravels slowly but surely as the idea of noble suffering makes its way to the fore and Rodion has to make some tough decisions that will impact many of the characters in his life.The story unravels slowly but surely as the idea of noble suffering makes its way to the fore and Rodion has to make some tough decisions that will impact many of the characters in his life.I like to draw an analogy between Rodion's anguish and mine at reading the book. It is long -- very long -- and thoroughly enjoyable, but at points I didn't want to put it down and felt compelled to read for very long stretches. Alas, the size of the book make this impossible and the anguish of the story and its weight on me drew on for over a week.In the end, the closing words referring to \\"another story\\" could refer as much to Crime and Punishment itself as to my story of reading the novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you are a Japanese reader, I recommend Ikuo Kameyama's recent translation (2008).

Although the style of Dostoyevsky himself is lost in the translation, the language is still completely amazing.

This is my favorite book of all time and I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskoinkov, a student that thinks himself a superman &amp; smarter then everyone else.

No sooner is the deed done than remorse lays siege to his resolve. What follows is one of the GREATEST psychological studies in world literature. A masterpiece of Insight that calls into question the very nature of good &amp; evil. Some parts of this book may put you to sleep. But, those parts build on the parts that will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Here is the conclusion of a paper I wrote, entitled &quot;Theme and Symbolism in Crime and Punishment&quot;. It conveys how I feel about this amazing book. Symbolism and imagery in Crime and Punishment are used to a well-executed and imaginitive extent. Dostoevksy is able to do with words what Picasso did with a brush. Through a couple of different means Dostoevsky is able to convey a powerful theme, and draw the reader into the story. Dostoevsky's means of communicating the theme of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; add depth to the story,a nd help make his point against rationalists stronger. As Gibian states, &quot;Dostoevsky did not rely solely on the weapons of his opponenet, but used the whole gamut of his artistic resources, among which oblique reference and symbolic devices played an important part&quot; (543). Dostoevsky's masterful use of language and symbolism add potency and effectiveness to this timeless tale.&quot; In short, this book is one of the best books I have ever read (and I've read a LOT of books in my day!)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My daughter loves Russian literature ever since high school.

This classic will not disappoint, but it is not quite as good as &#34;The Brothers Karamazov.&#34; It is a bit long, but engaging. Dostoyevsky addresses big questions, ones which will always be asked, though this postmodern age discourages self examination which dares to moralize. Dostoyevsky takes you inside the mind of his characters (which seems to be common to the Russian authors of the period), and you begin to compare your own thoughts.

Dostoevsky enhances the reader's understanding of the human psyche at the edge of it wits. But as you read you start to indeed wonder if this is a time of abnormality for young Raskolnikov or is it a possibility that all of us have the capability of thinking and acting in a like-minded fashion? As time breathes an air of consistency, Raskolnikov is dependent on his wits, but as externalities seize his attention he begins to meander into the abyss of social ingratitude."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is one of the most amazing books that I have ever read. It is slightly different from the original Russian version, however, it's the best book of all time. It is envigorating and fascinating. It makes you cry and laugh.

I finished it about a week ago, and stopped by this site to see what others had to say about it. What I realize now is that I miss reading it. I picked it up to gain a little background on Petersburg before my upcoming trip there and enjoyed the book thoroughly. But Raskolnikov, more than a week old in my memory (and a murderer, to boot) still enchants me. I feel profound understanding and respect for Rodya, in spite of his actions, and I would characterize this as a longing for his company. By this standard, as well as the egotistic philosophy that the book preaches, I give it five thumbs up."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevski has a great ability to describe passion, fear and all unstable states of mind. The way he described the passion of winning in &quot;Gambler&quot; , fear of facing the truth that he, Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, was unable to exist without the common man, and is not superior is just awesome. Crime and Punishment provides very colorful depiction of Russia and takes one to a journey into realm of conflict and fear in one's self. A definite classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the epitome of Existential literature. Never before has there been such a detailed and accurate account of the human psyche and the burdens of life. Raskolnikov is a man plagued with choices, who battles himself to try to find the best solution to his problem. Influenced Nietzsche and Freud. Incredible read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a great book that must be read by everyone that loves the philosophical and social themes that drive great books. Philosophically and socially this book is pure genius. Especially when you consider when this book was written, Dostoyevsky has made an impactful and lasting mark on literature and philosophy with this novel. This book was written in Russia when nihilism was the prevalent philosophy and social doctrine. At a time when morality was moving towards being seen as almost non-tangible, this book makes a bold statement. That statement is that you cannot deny the basic, intrinsic morality that is linked to humanity. Without things like remorse, guilt, and most importantly love, one ceases to be human. Dostoyevsky makes a point that there is something deep in all of us that is tangible...a morality that is not linked to laws but is linked to humanity and in the capacity to love. And that humanity overrides everything. Laws change, philosophies are debated, society evolves...but one must remain human...above all else. An all encompassing theme, delivered by a skilled writer."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Here's a book that intimidates the less hard-core reader.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read...it will be worth it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Having tried to repeadetly to read this book, I found it somewhat hard to get into at first.

Anyone who claims the book is &quot;boring&quot; &quot;to slow&quot; &quot;lacks plot&quot; &quot;sucks&quot; &quot;etc&quot;, surely read a different book than I did. With that said...buy this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It would be easy to dissect the plot of this timeless classic, to go into teh writers prison time and gambling habits and addcition to excess and misery. That would be simple. Instead I will talk about the craft of writing itself. This book excels not so much based upon form in the plot structure. The story is simple and even when examined rather sad and simplistic. Instead it is the craft of writing. Nearly 500 pages of true poetic writing. Writing that sustains even as to some points it bores. By bores I mean in length and depth of personal introspection. Through American fiction we are used to action, action, action, dialogue explaining what the action was. In Russian literature there is a focus on history in relationship to the main characters and their circumstances. Russian literature is concerned with the political forces that shape lives, in America we are concerned with how fame shapes the body politic. Take Dreiser's Sister Carrie as an example of the desire for fame at the cost of morals in comparison to the theft of money for survival, from a despicable person.What I often do with &quot;heavy&quot; books like this is I get the Cliffnotes to accompany the book as I read it, to in a sense have both a discussion internally and a map so that I don't miss any of the rich fields along the way. That is how the classics should be taught, with an eye to the brains that have yet to be initiated into such heavy patience reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Second only to &quot;Catcher In the Rye&quot; in my list of all time favorites, this novel could be considered a textbook on the sociopathic mind. Admittedly, after finishing the story, I felt tempted to try and invent my own system of morality... but that would have taken effort. &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; exeplifies the danger of existentialism. This danger lies in the fact that if each individual were permitted to define his or her own morality, than distinguishing what man is a better man than another would be more an acount of the amount of change, period, that he brings to the world than of the values of &quot;benign&quot; or&quot;good&quot; change. Although Raskolnikov's actions changed only a handful of lives it is clear that his motives were less driven by the desire for financial gain and more of a product to validate his own existence and his above average intelligence. It is a common fallacy that all sociopaths do what they do in order to gain someting. In fact, the vast majority of psycho-pathic serial killers murder not only for the &quot;thrill&quot; of their actions, but also in order to prove their intellect. &quot;I can get away with this because I am smarter than they are.&quot; This is the attitude which Raskolnikov keeps to himself, in a most deft manner, I might add, througout at least two-thirds of the novel. The circumstances which he encounters at the end represent his humbling as a human being. Most non-violent sociopaths do outgrow their anti-social behaviors as they age. In parallel, this humbling of Raskolnikov's personality is an example of emotional, and possibly spiritual growth."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I think that this book is one of the best books that I've ever read in all of my life!!!

After approximately 8-9 months of on and off again reading, I finally finished the magnum opus that is &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. Overall I found the book fascinating and more detailed than any other book I've read. I think this is what left me most disappointed. After so many plot elements twisting and characters faltering, the ending seemed somewhat unfulfilling. Seeing as I don't wish to spoil the ending for anyone, I'll leave most of my criticism unsaid.Dostoevsky has created a book solid in social criticism and quite heavy in the psychological aspect of the human condition. Raskolnikov is a socially distant character fed up with the world of immorality he sees developing around him. His family sees him as their only hope and those around him love him to death, while Raskolnikov takes all of these envious gestures as &quot;plagues acquired from Asia&quot;. After committing his crime, Raskolnikov is forced to live in cowardice and fear. It is in this state of distress that Raskolnikov realizes he needs love and compassion as much as anybody. Unfortunately it takes him a couple murders and many many peoples shambled lives to find this out.Considering this is a classic and should be read by anybody remotely interested in literature, I'll not say anymore.Well, on to a nice leisurely stroll into &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot;.4.75/5 stars"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Simply excellent! However, I especially liked the beginning more the end. The character of Roskolnikov is excellent built and described.

It also looks at a couple of interesting issues regarding the human brain, crime and punishment.This book does take a bit of patience to read, and some parts are rather boring and longwinded, but overall, the book will leave you feeling....blown away (not the most likely word to describe a classic I know, but true)Read it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, Dostoyevsky poses several questions. Is murder ever justifiable? Can a man think himself exempt from moral law and commit murder because the victim's death will benefit society? Does a human life hold any intrinsic value, or does a person have to prove himself worthy of living? In the end, Dostoyevsky proposes answers to these complex questions, answers rooted in surprisingly simple logic. This novel is a superb rendition of a man's struggles with his demons, his suffering, retribution, punishment and eventual triumph."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky does it again, well I guess he did it quite a while ago, but this is my first reading. This book is a great look into the soul of a man who though he may be a murderer has a great love and passion for life. The plot held me with every turn of the page and had me questioning what was going on in my own mind several times. It is definitely more focused than Brothers Karamzov and is a more powerful story in some ways. This translation is wonderfully rendered and only seems stilted a couple of times at most. Overall this is truly a great book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The book, Crime and Punishment, is truly a classic. The story revolves around an intelligent young man by the name of Rodion Raskolnikov.

Dostoyevsky has an amazing talent for creating characters. Great authors can be recognized by their ability to create characters that the reader can identify with.

I wasn't expecting to like this book because I had to read it for a class but I really, really liked it.

It's an intelligent, refreshing classic.Also recommeded: The House of the Dead by Dostoyevsky"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"this is a book full of amazing charachters"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment, as a work of interpretive fiction, contains excellent writing, attention to detail, character development, and theme. That said, my review remains only mildly approbational, for the reasons which I shall enumerate forthwith. Hopelessly flaccid, the work reads more like an enervated documentary or stereo instructions than a fictional examination of mental disturbance. Furthermore, the works lacks the virtue of subtlety; i.e., does the reader have to be informed in the conclusion in the most direct and blatant manner possible of one of the author's principle ideas, revealed thoroughly in the rest of the novel.One of the most disappointing features of the novel is its lack of visual artisty or profundity. As an alleged epitome of 19th-century literature, it lacks every endearing facet of the period. The poetic majesty of Romanticism, not here. The profound significance and introspection of anti-transcendentalism, no vacancy in the pages of this novel. How about sweeping social commentary of novels of the incipient century (A Tale of Two Cities or Howards End), sorry, but that must be on back order.Much richer prose can be read in the writings of Hawthorne, Melville, and Wilde. Hawthorne's symbolism and imagery (a word Dostoyevsky must not know) detail his works with something akin to aesthetic decadence. Melville relishes in the epic and profound mysteries of existence, imparting his philosophy to the reader in a superlatively engaging fashion. Wilde's sardonic tone in The Picture of Dorian Gray and his intimated wry amusement with his protagonist works far better than Dostoyevsky's harassment of the reader with his psychotic protagonist.In short, the work is a dismal representative of classical literature. Independently, however, it has merit, but not in the context of a classic. It demeans the classical genre almost as badly as the superficial novel To Kill A Mockingbird does. To conclude, it succeeds in conveying its message to the reader, but little else."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Over the weekend, I saw a fresh copy of this book on my nephew's desk and asked if he had read it yet. He had not and I subsequently gave him a short summary so as to prepare him for the long haul. Is this book really a good choice for a high school AP literature class? It will very likely turn most students off Russian novels forever. The classics are classic because they give you some kind of new or profound insight into the human condition. This book may do that, but in a very laborious way. I did not enjoy reading this book. Perhaps it's better in the original Russian.I am certainly in the minority here, but to illustrate my point, look at some of the comments from Amazon's most helpful, 5-star reviews: \\"the book seems wordy in places, nothing is hurried, do not expect it to be a rip-roaring page turner, the story develops slowly, with many detours, this is no beach-read thriller, Dostoyevsky manages to be both dense and long-winded.\\" Yes, I know these comments are taken out of context from some balanced, very thoughtful reviews. But despite a relatively simple narrative, this book is too long and the writing is very mundane.Raskolnikov kills an old pawn broker. His conscience is bothering him. Ok, fine, let's explore that subject in all its dimensions. I only wish that Steinbeck or Bronte had written the long version. I would have preferred if The Great Gatsby was another 100 pages. But this stuff... no thanks. Dostoevsky's punishment extends well beyond poor Raskolnikov, as my nephew will soon discover when he begins his long, hard slog through this overblown classic.Follow-up Comments, April 13, 2010:I have already received three \\"not helpful\\" votes on Amazon. That's fairly common with negative reviews for a literary classic. Roast a sacred cow, then start racking up the \\"not helpful\\" votes. In any case, I asked my nephew how Crime and Punishment was coming along. \\"I finished it,\\" he said. He later added that it was \\"not too bad.\\" He also pointed out that perhaps the book was \\"not too bad\\" because it was being discussed in his high school literature class. Maybe that's the key to Crime and Punishment. It's like a frog in formaldehyde. There's not much life in it, but you can learn a lot by careful dissection."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The \\"idea\\" behind this book surrounded the debate between intellectuals in the 1860's about whether Russia should mondernize and adopt Western ideas, gov't, culture, etc. Dostoevsky was adamantly, nay, zealously, opposed to westernization of russian life. Instead, he had this quasi-religious idea of Russia turning away from the rest of Europe and returning to its Russian Orthodox roots. This is why he has this obsession with \\"suffering\\", which, evidently, is a basic idea in the older, mystical forms of Christianity. It's also why his \\"good\\" characters - the ones who represent what traditional Russians are - like Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna, Sonya, Porfiry, all share his obsession and preach its virtues. The \\"bad\\" characters - Luzhin, Svidrigailov, and Lebezyatnikov (actually a muddle-headed good guy) - all represent westernized Russians, and in D's eyes have been corrupted by non-Russian ideas. Are all satirical figures. Only Raskolnikov is not thoroughly condemned. He's a bit of both Old Russia and New Europe. He's westernized on the surface - full of the new ideas, a fact fantastically illustrated by his delusion about being another \\"Napoleon\\", an obvious representative of the west. But deep down he's a \\"good\\" Russian, as his decision to turn himself in and accept the 'necessity' of suffering makes clear. Hence his name which comes from Russian \\"raskolnik\\" which means 'schism' or \\"divided\\". So the central figure embodies the struggle between East and West, and his interactions with other characters are the dramatizations of the so-called \\"arguments\\" surrounding the debate.That's the \\"big idea\\". Whether it ever made any sense - and I doubt it ever did - makes no difference now since it's obviously way out of date. So no-one in his right mind can say that C&P; is a \\"great book\\" because of its \\"ideas\\". In fact, I'm not even sure it's a great book. I've never liked D as a novelist: he's third rate. What he really is is a dramatist and polemicist. He has an ear for dialogue, and a wonderful eye for drama and suspence. But he's a mediocre writer. The main difference between a play and a novel is all that stuff between the dialogue - the descriptive narrative. This is where a novelist shows what kind of writer he is. D is no Dickens, or Tolstoy, or even Eliot. He can tell a good story, but there's nothing in the writing itself that I couldn't pen myself. \\"All\\" I lack his talent for dialogue and drama. Of course, that makes all the difference, but you see the point: he has no style as a novelist. He might have made a better playwright.One last comment on this idea that Dostoevsky is some kind of \\"philosopher\\". I've never heard a philosopher make this claim. A real philosopher is a creative thinker, a person who produces original ideas. There are no original and profound philosophical \\"ideas\\" in D's writing. There is a half-baked religious notion that Russian people needed to \\"get back to their Orthodox roots\\" to escape the fate of godless Western societies. This isn't \\"philosophy\\"; it's sophistry.In fact, as a rule, literature is a bad place to look for new ideas. In the past year I've read most of Dickens and Shakespeare, two of the most original and creative writers in any language, and neither ever expressed an idea that someone else hadn't already uttered. What they did do was express old ideas in wonderfully new ways. It's how they phrased thoughts that made them worth reading, not the thoughts themselves, which were often quite banal (\\"to be or not to be...\\"!). Dostoevsky is no different. It isn't what he wrote that was important, but how he wrote it - not the ideas themselves, but how he dramatised those ideas.So if you want philosophy, then go read philosophy. But if you want nice stories, then read literature. C&P; is a good, but not great, story. It's definitely not philososphy, though. Not even bad philosphy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The unsettling story of a sultry young man with unbridled passion fell into his own state of deprivation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Rodia, the main character of the book, divides humans into two groups- 1) those that must obey the laws and 2) those that are laws unto themselves, to which to other law is applicable. Using this idea, he rationalizes the murder of a pawn broker, which led to the incidental murder of the pawn broker's sister. He saw the first woman as a parasite on humanity, so rationalized her killing, then rationalized killing the other woman because she walked in on the first murder.I found Rodia to be a dispicable person and didn't really like anybody else in the book. The only person I found somewhat likeable was the cop that solved the crime. The cop understood man's (and Rodia's) many faults, yet still liked him.Dostoyevsky likes to find and dwell on the faults of people, which, as mentioned above, doesn't make any character sympathetic. The book is depressing, so it took me over a month to finish, but is an excellent book, looking at the dark side of men."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is one of the great books on human nature of all time. The book centers on the question of ethical caste systems in human affairs. Is it (as Nieztsche and Machivelli would have it) the case that humans find themselves operating under different ethical laws which depend on such things as birthright, intelligence and social status? Or is the situation that (as Kant and Cicero would have it) all men are equal before the law? And what, exactly, is it which decides this?The story centers around a poor Russian peasant named Raskolnikov who believes himself to be the calibre of person that Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon were &amp; therefore is exempt from the &quot;normal&quot; everyday ethics of the rest of us. He contrives to murder a wealthy old woman and then use her money for noble purposes. The plan turns into a debacle, however, when a second person shows up &amp; he is forced to kill her, too.From there, Raskolnikov's mental deterioration begins. The police know he did it, but cannot prove it. Can Raskolnikov deal with his conscience? Shouldn't &quot;superior&quot; me be apt to cope with the sacrifice of a little messy bloodshed when higher purposes are aimed for?

I must say I was disappointed. I read it through, and kept waiting to get that rush of intellectual stimulation feeling, but it never came. I didn't get a feeling that I was missing something; it was more a sense of &quot;come on fyodor, I know you're capable of more than this.&quot; The dualistic personality of Rasko was interesting, the superman theory &amp; putting it into practice w/utilitarianism was interesting, and the epilogue was great. Great, that is, until the last page. The standard Hollywood ending of &quot;give yourself to love and life will be eternal bliss&quot; was extremely weak, and seemed to undermine the whole character of Raskolnikov, which got me thinking about Fyodor himself. I'm guessing that Rasko is very similar to Dost as a young student. I would also guess that these superman theories and the desire to kill the old lady was probably also taken from Dost's real life experiences. But from here the novel splits from real life. Dostoevsky didn't actually kill anyone in his life, for he didn't have the courage/evil/whatever you want to call it. It seems like he wrote an entire novel to prove that &quot;well, even if I had killed her, I just would've gone nuts anyways and messed up my life and everyone else's&quot;. It's like he's trying to make excuses for a crime that he wanted to commit but didn't. I also don't like his advocation of leaving reason behind and turning your back on your convictions in order to do whatever feels right. Dostoevsky has such brilliant thoughts, but then he makes these conclusions that just disappoint me greatly. It's like he's too scared to follow his mind, so he just turns away out of weakness. But anyways, I think the novel would've been better if Dost. stuck to his life experiences, rather than getting so fictional. I think his psychology of Rasko after the crime was a bit off. Some killers do feel intense guilt and confess, but the very vast majority of them don't. They rationalize and blame other people and in the end feel no guilt at all. It seems like a case of wishful thinking. But anyways I was just very disappointed with it. Too much boring pointless plot. Not enough development of the philosophies. Rasko fainting whenever he heard someone talk about the murder seemed a bit exaggerated. I did like when Rasko commented that he's not a Napoleon (it just would've been more realistic if he figured this out before the murder). If someone has the strength to murder someone else, chances are they're going to have the strength to deal with the resulting emotions. And I liked when Rasko was in prison and said that his beliefs were all still valid. But then he falls to his knees and gives himself to love and walks off into the sunset to live in neverending happiness. Please. Ally McBeal is more realistic than that. Read The Brothers Karamazov or Notes From Underground. They're more mature &amp; deeper."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It's probably me, since this is a classic but I just could not get through it. I even had my Kindle read it to me on my way to and from work but it was just so boring and hard to get into."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky produced so many ground-breaking case studies of humanity's and ideology's perilous alliance. This book is one of his great fictions- not a treatise on political science as the title might suggest! Rashkolnikov, the protagonist, is a raffish, young ex-law student that commands the respect of his peers and the virtue of his family. He is arrogant, clever, self-conscious, and generous all in the midst of a moral and physical delerium that characterizes his on-the-edge existence. This \\"classic\\" is a thriller/mystery. But, what makes the story a mystery is not that Rashkolnikov is a murderer, but that he is so like us- the trademark of many a timeless classic. Rashkolnikov earns sympathy with humanity and intelligence. You'll be so much in his shoes that you'll feel the intensity and dizziness of the thoughts that pass through his head, as he weighs the fates of those around him. Part of the thrill is watching his endless rationalizations and schemes become foiled by his illness and by (yes, even in this novel- a love story or two!) the love of a young, unfortunate girl, who drives Rashkolnikov to accept the guilt that he could easily elude. The suspense virtually plugs the reader into the story, making the book one you just can't put down, for fear of losing touch with the gripping reality of Rashkolnikov's fate. I even felt like I had to question my own innocence, as Rashkolnikov dodged friends, inspectors, and a man like himself, forcing me to see things from his view, sometimes even to agree with him, and always to root for him. I liked &lt;&lt;The Idiot>> even better at the time, but this is a masterpiece on another level. My mother read it and loved the ending, and understood in her own way why R. did what he did. This is not only a fun, intellectual read, but also a feel good novel. Get it and don't let the Russian names and the silly title scare you anymore!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the novel Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov confessed to the murder in order to end his inner turmoil which alienated him from society. After committing the murders at the end of part one, the reader is led to believe that his motivation was for the good of humanity since the pawnbroker was greedy and served no positive role to anyone who knew her (and the sister's death was committed only to ensure Raskolnikov not be witnessed). It was later found out that his reasoning was to commit an extraordinary act, making him fit the characteristics of what he felt was a man above ordinary qualities. This reveals the truth to the reader about Raskolnikov's unusual behavior and struggles with guilt, since we understand why his inner-conscience was so damaged, making him physically sick. Contained within himself for a long period of time, this feeling ate him up inside until the religious and inspiring words of Sonia convinced Raskolnikov to confess. She explained to him that all of the upsetting feelings would go away, and that god would repent him of his sins. This would make him forgiven in the eyes of god, and Sonia would respect him for letting out his secret. He would live in peace and feel better about himself. As a result, Raskolnikov confessed to the murder(s) in order to cease his inner hell and feel able to face society again. He wanted to do the right thing, but it took the inspiring words of someone he admired to help aid him and go through with it. After confessing to the murders, his life could only get better, allowing him to \\"start over\\" and live his life with his mistake in the past."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I wanted to give this book 5 stars or atleast 4 1/2 stars but it was a bit lengthy for my taste. I just finished &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and just couldn't believe that it was a 19th century book. Maybe I felt that way coz of my lack of insight about history. He lays so much emphasis on the psychology part of a crime along with the moral aspect. Dostoyevsky is unimaginably intelligent writer. At times I wondered if he himself went through that ordeal that his main character went through. Thats how vividly he described Raskolnikov's experience. Sad that it had to be translated and I am sure some of the beauty of language (as weaved by Mr. D himself) is lost. But nevertheless it is a very gripping novel. I normally am scared of epic books (this book was almost 600 pages) but I finished it in just 2 days and thats a record for me. I recommend this book to anyone who likes psychology, philosophy and literature as well as those who like character-driven or plot-driven (it is both) books."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"As Rodion Raskolnikov demarcated humanity in terms of &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;extraordinary,&quot; humanity can also be generalized in terms of those who empthasized with Rodion, and those who feel this book is simply glorifying the abnormal psychology of killers. The fact of the matter is this story is important for anyone attempting to philosophize upon humanity's darker side; sometimes it takes such an extreme example to raise the right questions. To bind one's opinion of this story by the mere confines of law and order does this story no justice as it would also limit the enlightenment one gets out of it. Especially today, as more young people strive to achieve righteousness through misinfluenced means, this book's importance is founded upon the over-intellectualization of the righteous path, and if any human can dub themselves worthy of taking it. Dostoevsky's unique way of humbling us with such journeys do more than merely increase our capacity for thought, they aide us in our travel to understand even the most outcasted mind, thus increasing our understanding of ourselves. I reccomend this classic piece of literature to anyone, both young and old, free-thinking and close-minded alike.

I am so grateful that my parents didn't allow me to use that word without a reprimand. My mother, a voracious reader,always told me &quot;David, if you're bored your're boring&quot;. I always got on the defensive when told this. As I grew older I began to understand what she meant.

Wrapped up in an exciting storyline are some of the most profound images of human nature, pride, suffering, redemption, sacrifice, and love that I have yet to read. The dualism of the ordinary man vs. the extraordinary man are convicting and force introspection. There is alot more of Razkolnikov in us than we wish to admit... both the warm hearted compassionate person and the detached monomaniac. The presence of two &quot;people&quot; within us is the source of much of our inner conflict and Razkolnikov is easy to see as an image of ourselves. The polar extremes built in to our human nature contribute to and in fact require our suffering.I will not forget this book. I found it philosophically challenging and surprisingly accessible; however, I will never &quot;understand&quot; it. I take away another bit of insight each time I think about Razkolnikov, but his character is one that can never be fully explored."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have to say that having read three different translations of this, and other Dostoevsky works, that I'm perplexed as to how people can give such high acclaim for the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations of these novels. People claim to dislike Garnett because she's too Victorian, or because she's a woman, or because she isn't entirely accurate in her rendering, well I haven't read a translation that is 100% accurate to the Russian. Something some might like to know is that Constance Garnett's translations are actually a lot more accurate than the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations. There is, however, one translation that stands out as being a pretty accurate rendering for Crime and Punishment and this is by David McDuff. On top of being very close to the Russian, his translation is also very enjoyable to read. All in all, I like Garnett's and McDuff's translations of Dostoevsky respectively. And, if you're looking for an accurate rendering, you can't go wrong with either McDuff or Garnett."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Why do people ride roller coasters? For the thrill. Why do people visit haunted houses? For the fright. Why read Crime and Punishment? For the paranoia, dread and remorse. Initially believing himself to be a superman, beyond reach of the moral constraints of ordinary men, Raskolnikov robs and murders a cheating pawnbroker. Who would miss her? She's a blight on society. Over time, he comes to regret murdering her partly because of his paranoid thoughts that people are on to him and partly because he learns that each person, no matter how seemingly low, has value and the inherent right to live. Somehow, Dostoevsky insinuates Raskolnikov's paranoia, dread and remorse into the reader's own psyche. The effect is more powerful and enduring than the temporary, cheap thrill of any roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoff , the truly marvellous creation of Dostevsky's \`Crime and Punishment ', representative of an uncontrollably intelligent mind swarming with thoughts bearing doubt, anger, chaos and extreme kindness!

The book then follows Rodion's path of self-destruction, bought about largely due to his inability to resist the incessant, yet hauntingly and brilliantly perceptive derivations of his own mind. A man lost in himself every breathing moment, unaware of his physically deteriorating body, and helpless in regards, his tumultuous mind.

That is to say, until he meets the pawnbroker whom his drinking buddies thought the town would be better off without, Rashkolnikov had no idea that she would be the person he would kill. After a fitful night of sleep where he struggled mightily with the fear that he would not be able to act, and with the inner forces warring within his head, he kills the pawnbroker and her sister (who showed up on the scene of the crime unexpectedly).And at least temporarily, Rashkolnikov is now finally relieved that he has at least exercised the ability to take his own miserable life into his own hands. It is a serious step towards his own perceived freedom and self-emancipation to a new level of autonomy and self-respect. He then attempts to proceed through life secretly living inside the profound new post-crime realities his act has created: The new reality is bracketed by the fact that he has now become both \\"a man of action,\\" and a mindless random \\"murderer.\\"Thereafter, the trajectory of the protagonist's life has been forever changed. As dense and as complicated as it was before the crime, there is now to be no peace between the warring demons inside his head, or from the unintended guilt associated with the implications and consequences of the enormity of his crime. Rashkolnikov discovers all too slowly that simply being able to rise to the level of \\"(mindless) action in the moment\\" does not alone solve his existential dilemma of living a cramped and marginal life of fear in a Socialist country, where he is cowered mostly by his own too timid ability to act in defense of his own freedom; i.e., his inability to act in defense of his psychological survival. Apparently there is more to self-respect than just being able to cross the threshold from doing nothing over to engaging in committed action?\\"In short, Rashkolnikov's discovers too late that his \\"new post-crime reality,\\" rather than freeing him and simplifying his life, it further strangled and complicated it rather dramatically. The struggle within his head no longer was just about the \\"nature\\" of the crime, but now was also about its \\"content\\" and their implications and consequences. Thus unexpectedly, Rashkolnikov found himself in the midst of a new more complex inner war that continued, unabated. And as the balance of forces within his head slowly shifted until they had tilted further and further towards his guilt, Rashkolnikov's torment compelled him to confess to the crime.Throughout the novel, Doestoyevsky puts us inside Rashkolnikov's head. We are able to see up close the Freudian dance of the build-up of tension that is going on there, a dance that rises to a crescendo as the protagonist brings himself to the point of confronting the full implications of his crime and eventually confessing to it.Existential AnalysisExcept perhaps for Freud himself and Shakespeare, Doestoyevsky sits alone at the top of the heap in his ability to strip away those layers of man's mind that get in the way of, and that get him away from, fully understanding who he is: that is to say, the inner forces and psychological dynamics that separate him away from how and why he acts. Unlike Freud and his acolytes, including most of the Existential psychologists, Doestoyevsky goes straight to the jugular bypassing the intellect in his analysis of man's will to act.His analysis through the device of novels, (and especially this one; but the formula has been set in his \\"Notes from the Underground\\") of man's will to act, is nothing less than a grand methodology for entering and understanding the psychological dialogue that man has with himself every time he makes a decision to defend what is perceived to be threats to his psychological survival. The Doestoyevsky dialogue (dialectic actually) is the very definition of what uncharted introspection is all about: the tension just below awareness in the constant struggle between the \\"inner\\" and \\"outer\\" forces shaping man's daily existence.The novel in Doestoyevsky's very able hands is only a device for entering the internal debate at eye level, bypassing the unneeded intellectual level altogether. After all, when man acts, intellect is only one of the parameters that come into play. And arguably it is seldom the most important one. Despite this, Doestoyevsky like Sartre, Camus, Otto Rank, Norman O. Brown, Arthur Koestler, and Ernest Becker, after him, gives us the road map for understanding what is going on inside man's head as he rises up on his hind legs to defend the very reason for his existence: to survive psychologically.As always (and as usual when society intervenes) the struggle is between the id and the alter ego; that is to say between the savagely primitive forces within us and those forces within society trying to place constraints on that savagery. Thus in a real sense, all of Doestoyevsky's novels are about this ultimate struggle for freedom: freedom of the mind from the shackles imposed by society. In this sense it mimicks Freud's arguments in \\"Civilization and its Discontents.\\" 10 Stars"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is an excellent reading of one of the greatest novels ever written. The reader, though never overintrusive, adds inflections that capture Raskolnikov's confusion of thought, the Detective Porfiry's Columbo-like approach to tracking his prey, Razumikhin's charm, Dunya's charisma, Luzhin's sleaziness, Svidrigailov's suicidal nihilism, Marmeladov's drunkenness, and Sonia's saintliness.Everyone reads this book in school, and I read it more than once in my youth. But I definitely encourage you to re-read a classic like this, and the audiobook format makes it easy to do so in one's spare time. What I forgot and did not remember until re-reading this book is the extraordinary cast of supporting characters Dostoyevsky creates. Svidrigailov is a precursor of Stavrogin, the great nihilistic anti-hero of Dostoyevsky's later novel \\"The Devils\\" and is a perfect foil for Raskolnikov -- taking his radical amoral philosphy to its logical conclusion via his suicide. Yet, like the other great evil heroes of Dostoyevsky's work, Svidrigailov is multidimensional, including his ability to display a surprising charm. Dostoyevsky does not lightly dismiss the lure and charm of evil, which is why his novels are great moral masterpieces and can be emotionally draining.Another great foil for Raskolnikov is his level-headed friend Razumikhin, whose ability to cut through the radical chic of the day and live sensibly provides a model for the reader, as does Raskolnikov's sister Dunya.Of course, the third and most important foil for Raskolnikov is the Christ-like Sonia. Her character has been the subject of some criticism. The prostitute with the heart of gold can strike the reader as unrealistic and overly symbolic. But on this re-reading, I was struck by her character. Raskolnikov recognizes that if Sonia continues on too much longer in her craft, she will be corrupted. And Sonia's ability to inspire others is shown in Dostooyevsky's convincing portrayals of how others react to her, particularly the other Siberian prisoners at the end of the book. That no one has ever been quite as saintly as Sonia must be conceded. But anyone with an optimistic or Christian view of human nature can see a bit of Sonia in everyone and can see that there are points in some people's lives where they do live up to her ideal. I found myself quite taken with her character; indeed, without the character, the Christian theme of redemption that is at the core of the book would be impossible.Also striking on re-reading is the great confusion of Raskolnikov's nonetheless quite brilliant thinking. In one remarkable scene, Raskolnikov gives Sonia several explanations of why he committed the crime. Each explanation has some truth in it, yet is also in a sense false as Raskolnikov himself recognizes. The episode demonstrates the author's critical point that morally and religiously unhinged thinking is inevitably confused and false.The ending of Crime and Punishment is also criticized for copping out -- for not explaining just how Raskolnikov becomes redeemed. But Dostoyevsky can hardly write a book about everything, and it suffices that he has shown quite convincingly the psychology of a man led astray who then starts his journey back to redemption by accepting the Christian philosophy of love, sacrifice, and suffering. For me, Dostoyevsky's greatest novel -- the Brothers Karamazov -- takes up the story started in Crime and Punishment. In that novel, Dostoyevsky portrays in Alyosha a saintly character more subtle than Sonia -- as well as the character that Raskolnikov at the end of novel is striving to become.For me, Dostoyevsky is the great writer of Western Civilization, and I highly recommend this novel as his most accessible -- made still more accessible by this audiobook format."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"\\"Crime and Punishment\\" is probably the most famous and most accessible of Dostoevsky's novels. Set in late Nineteenth Century Saint Petersburg, the novel contains elements of a detective story, a psychological study and metaphysical exploration.The novel is about an impoverished young law student named Raskolnikov who examines the possibility of killing his elderly landlady and stealing her money so that he can use it to assist his family. Raskolnikov soon concludes that killing the landlady constitutes a heroic and decisive act of courage. He murders her with an axe and steals her money but soon falls under suspicion and is investigated by the police. The police inspector suspects Raskolnikov of committing the crime but does not attempt to arrest him immediately. Instead, the inspector drags out the investigation in order to give Raskolnikov the opportunity to come to terms with his own conscience. Eventually the burden on Raskolnikov's conscience and the realization that his crime will not solve his family's problems compel Raskolnikov to confess. He is subsequently arrested and sentenced to a few years imprisonment in Siberia.Although \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is something of a thriller, it is largely a novel of ideas. When Raskolnikov rationalizes his right to kill his landlady, he assumes the role of the Nietzian superman: an individual whose state of mind and whose actions transcend good and evil. The police inspector symbolizes the counter argument to Raskolnikov's validation of the Nietzian superman by realigning Raskolnikov with his own conscience. Ultimately, this novel argues that no man is beyond good and evil and that any attempt to thwart one's conscience is bound to end in folly.The theme of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" takes place on an individual level, but can also be applied to the historical progress of nations as well. Dostoevsky was passionately opposed to what he felt was mankind's hubris in attempting to build a paradise on Earth-an act that he felt was symbolized by the Crystal Palace (Britain's exhibit in the World's Fair). Dostoevsky believed that creating a utopian society involved the type of deliberate human sacrifice and moral realignment performed by Raskolnikov. Dostoevsky's fears appear to have been born out in the Soviet experience, in which the entire apparatus of government from the leaders of the nation to the lowest commissars slaughtered millions of Russian citizens in the name of socialism and progress."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A friend of mine forced me to read this book over the summer (we had a bargain--I would read Dostoyevsky, she would read Richard Mitchell). I read it sporadically, without much interest, not making much progress, until I decided that I must crack down and finish it. And I found that the deeper I got into the book, the more interested I became; and not only interested, but awed by Dostoyevsky's skill. Clear-headed and sensible people who have never felt terrified and arrogant and confused will no doubt find this book pointless, as will those who dislike thinking, but the fact remains that this book is a work of art, which I heartily recommend to all."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There is no information as to which translation this is. So AVOID this until that information is given. The paper version and the Kindle version appear to be different translations. I bought this \\"Kindle version\\" of this, but I received the usual Constance Garnett translation. I called them and got my money refunded."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I don't want to split hairs here, but it just seems odd to me that the previous reviewer thought that the philosophical exploration in Crime and Punishment was somehow to be found in Rascalnikov, an obvious experimental protagonist like unto the lead revolutionary in The Devils, but by no means the philosophical key and insight into the mind and values of Dostoyevsky (the phrase, \\"Great literature, mediocre philosophy,\\" is what sticks out at me). If this comes from teaching highschool or middle school, then I truly sympathize.The police investigator, a marginal character, really, speaks a line way into the novel, after the murder of the landlord and the investigation is well under way, that pierces through the pages of the book and spells it out for us (at least it did for me): \\"Be the sun, and all will see you!\\" This line, in one sentence, spells out the author's true life-revelation and philosophy at that point, I think, if any can be said to exist in the book. It says be honest and open and loving and repenting of things you are not proud of (and eager to be something that others can be proud of?). It's one of those lines that are what make Dostoyevsky a master of philosophical fiction, like in the Grand Inquisitor's dialogue with Jesus. He takes you to a point where you are right with him and abbreviated dialogue are all that is required, if you are even paying attention. (Is this sounding too indignant?) That was just so obvious to me (even if I hadn't taken a college class on Dostoyevsky's entire oeuvre). This is born out by his many other novels and short stories. Pretty boring factoid, really, but one I thought worth pointing out to the previous reviewer. I think it is safe to say that the most poignant and revelatory utterance of the book outweighs the nervous ramblings of the protagonist, which is not a devout Russian Orthodox, as was Dostoyevsky, btw (that was such a big clue to most Literature buffs, I would imagine...).The whole \\"fighting modernism\\" thing of extreme political movements only starting to get roused in his day (like would later blow up into fullblown, black-booted isms like Communism, Nazism, and Italian Fascism) was a phenomenon that concerned their precursor, Dostoyevsky, a great deal, probably more than would be popular to speak about today, not for being a reactionary as often charged, however, but more for seeming to go against the grain of proletarian sympathies. Maybe the key here is to remember that the Cultural Revolution of Mao, and the book 1984, both come after Dostoyevsky. I think this is the kind of image of the revolutionary that Dostoyevsky may have had in mind. In this way he is something of a prophet (and I have not heard this angle frequently taken up, oddly). This comes out in The Devils, not his best, but easily his most politically insightful, where he almost spells out his distaste for politically-born, \\"above the masses\\" morality (as if that even makes any sense). Nietzschean figure though he does cut (Rascalnikov), I knew that he predated Nietzsche when I read it, and, even though I had already started reading up in my philosophy classes on Frederich by then, it never really struck me as a true likeness. Nietzsche is such a searching experimental outcast looking for his true calling (later possibly found in the quest for \\"Truth\\"), often over-committed and infrequently sold on action. This is completely unlike Dostoyevsky, who, by the time of the writing of Crime and Punishment, had long ago made more Christian and idealistic commitments that solidified in his stint as a political exile in Siberia.(Is it bad to start to feel yourself becoming the Amazon.com review police?)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the first of his string of classic novels, Fyodor Dostoyevsky delves deep into the human psyche. Using prose that is thick and penetrating, Dostoyevsky weaves a deep, stunning psychological portrait. The book is written in a very unconventional style: the murder is committed at the front of the book - as well as the interweaving of other scenes, which seem to have little or no relevance at first - without giving any motive or reason for it. It is only later, much later, in the book that the reason for the murder is revealed, and we spend the rest of the book in the mind of Raskolnikov. Slowly, piece by piece, more and more of his character is revealed, until we are aware that we have read one of the greatest character studies and psychological portraits in all of literature. The book raises several philosophical questions - as do all of Dostoyevesky's works - namely: is the intelligent human being beyond good and evil? Are they allowed to transgress moral if it will benefit humanity? Who qualifies and who doesn't? As relevant as this book still is today, it was, at the time, a deft exploration of the prevailing philosophies of the time, as well as a question into the then-just-emerging field of modern psychology. Raskolnikov shows the true fate of a Nietzschian superman, and begs the question, Is a man able to escape his own conscience? A true literary masterpiece with broad implications that hit hard to this day."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky's ending is beautiful. It brings marvelous closure to the inner struggles of the hero. When life was worthless it suddenly became meaningful. When the author is allowed to tell his story he replaces the dreary darkness with the light of hope. By laying the book to rest before it is finished, it is as if one were to judge a painting by the colors in the background before the artist had a chance to paint the bright colors of the foreground. Read the book and read it all the way through."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I love Dostoevsky, which is something of a curse. I read Crime and Punishment 13 years ago, and have spent the following years looking for something akin to this book.Dostoevsky has the rare gift of not just writing; but truly entering the mind of his subjects; every psychological nuance. Every fear; the paranoia, guilt, hatred, persecutiion, and angst of tortured souls (Maybe it was his stay in Siberia that shaped him).Everyone should read this book. It's an open letter about the human condition. Then read The Brothers Karamozov; then The Idiot.It's not happy reading. It's literature with soul. Someday I'll find a writer this good. Until then, I'll keep rereading Dostoevsky and continue the search."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A proposed measuring stick for evaluating a novel's importance: a great novel should do something that other novels do not.Crime and Punishment, measured by that standard, distinguishes itself by integrating astonishing psychological insight, suspense, and philosophical reflection, presenting them through characters that are memorable and largely believable, even if the way in which they weave into and out of the narrative are often not.It's too bad that you have to read beyond this novel to appreciate Dostoevsky's full power as a novelist. This novel, could have been a masterpiece. I don't believe it is.Its defining flaw, which partially eclipses its many perfections, lies in the author's inability of to do for Raskalnikov what Tolstoy did for Anna Karenina: to arouse sympathy for him as the fallen perpetrator of an act that naturally arouses disgust. Given the touching innocence of Lizaveta, one of Raskalnikov's victims, this would have been a forbidding task for any writer. But this writer, at his very best, is up to it. Thomas Mann referred to Dostoevsky's \\"criminal, saintly face.\\" The aptness of that description lies in the fact that this author uniquely possesses a profound appreciation of sin, of pure, unbridled human perversity, that rivals an equally compelling appreciation of grace.This novel does not reflect that balance. For it to do so, Raskalnikov would have to have a moment of moral recognition as compelling as his sin. He never does. His redemption, his acknowledgement that the people he slaughtered were more than insects comes, finally, as an afterthought -- literally -- it appears in the novel's Epilogue. So what you end up with is a quarter-saved Christian, an errant who, like Moll Flanders, makes a more compelling sinner than acolyte.I'll read it again, though. For Marmeladov, who, completely defeated by his drunkenness, stops just short of the \\"sin unto death\\" -- despair. For Svidrigalov, who, able finally to restrain himself, becomes nonetheless, the very embodiment of the failure that Marmeladov avoids. For Sonia, whose frank horror and compassion for Raskalnikov's soul is so compelling that you forget -- as you should -- what she does for a living. And of course, for the police inspector, who is like the voice of God.What a talent."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"C & P is Dostoyevsky's most acclaimed work, both in Russia and abroad. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why. Although I am not (yet) an expert on Dostoyevsky, I compare this work unfavorably to The Insulted and Humiliated, my introduction to Dostoyevsky. Although a relatively unheralded novel, I & H is much more emotionally charged, and involves the reader in its story almost intimately. I must say that C & P is bland by comparison. The weighty issues associated with C & P are really a side story to the love angle, which resonated with me only somewhat. Russian literature is the literature of pain and hardship (dont look for happy endings). I just did not feel as emotionally or intellectually engaged in these elements reading C & R as much as I expected to, considering the novel's reputation. I would not recommend it as an introduction to Dostoyevsky... However, it is Dostoyevsky, and it is a world classic, and thus must be read. C & P is certainly readable and moderately enjoyable. Many will find it thought-provoking. It has numerous well-developed characters and side-stories that engage the reader and catch him/her by surprise (perhaps too many, ergo the lack of an emotional bond to a specific story or character). The four stars represent the respect for the author and the work's cultural significance more then anything else. Read it once you've established a taste for Dostoyevsky (start with The Brothers Karamazov or The Insulted and Humiliated -- you wont be able to tare yourself away)."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I don't really have much to say about this book other than the fact that it was &quot;good.&quot; It's a classic and that says a lot about the nature of the writing, which most people try to avoid.

I liked Brothers Karamazov very much but I found Crime and Punishment to be pretty annoying, without any payoff. We have to follow the convoluted mind of a moron. The police detective just assumes that he will confess sooner or later because he's a gentleman, not a poverty-stricken crook. What's that about? Why the hell would you assume that a murderer would confess? Must we suspend our disbelief and our common sense before opening the book? Raskolnikov is an annoying person to read about, and I don't find him terribly realistic either. If he is such an idealist, why doesn't he regret, most of all, killing the shy lady? Why does he forget her as soon as he dispatches her? And that ending - I'm not going to spoil it for you but I'll just say I don't believe it. After reading this thoroughly mediocre book I was really amazed at how good Brothers Karamazov is."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"As an avid reader, I was told that Crime and Punishment was one of the best books written.

I agree with the reader before me who said \\"if you love Tolstoy you'll hate Destoevsky.\\" I'm am now finishing Anna Karennina and absolutely love it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If God is dead, or does not exist, then everything is permitted; but if he exists, we are not free and we are responsible for our actions. Raskolnokiv's convictions made him to murder an old woman for the betterment of the welfare of the society. Is killing someone really wrong, if at the end will benefit the society that we live in? Those who agree on this, they are utilitarinists. On the other hand however, te Kantian ethics resides, deontological ethhics which claim that killing is wrong because the act itself, by its very nature is wrong, hence, the conseuquence is not relevant.In Crime and Punishment, Dostoyevsky explored the inner instincts of the human mind and actions. With the figure of such a character (Raskolnikov) he investigated the potential of man to ve innately vicious and cruel and the only way to step beyond the limits of morality, Dostoyevsky argued that one must be like a Napoleon, a superman-like figure who questions the validity of such morality. This novel will, in future, in turn, will effect Nietzsche and he will write Thus Spoke Zarathustra, claiming that God is Dead and the idea of the Superman.One of the most significant themes of the novel rests on the idea that we must live life, regarless of the fact that everything is not for the best purpose, we must love it no matter how hopeless it maybe, in short, \\"we must love it more than its meaning\\". The following quote from Raskolnikov briefly summaries this theory: \\"Where is it I've read that some one condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he'd only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to liveso than to die at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!... How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!.. (Crime and Punishment, page 149)So, those of you who are interested in subjects like morality, ethics, god, \\"the meaning of life\\", ideology, illness and the unconscious, religion, humanity, and of course, Suffering - this is one of the best books on these issues and one of the masterpieces of world literature. Great book, placing characters in extreme situtations and testing their ability to use their freedom and choice in a given situation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"While I have not yet had a chance to actually read the book (because of other reading obligations with grad school), the book itself appears to be in good condition."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The only people who should read this book are people who belong to so called ' intelectual' parties, or people who have commited terrible crimes - it can replace death as ' The Capital Punnishment' .If you're intrested in good literature, smart writing, character analysis, ANYTHING... search elsewhere.If you shot your Teacher for forcing you to read this, you have my sympathy"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"after reading multiple reviews of Crime and Punishment written by readers who adore both the tale and its author to the point of asylum-worthy obsessions, i figured i'd check it out.first of all, the names are so similar that it is extremely tedious and difficult for the reader to have to fumble baaaack and fooorth.. page to page.. to recall which character is the doctor and which one is the detective.second of all, the entire book is a coincidence conspiracy. out of nowhere, connections were made, characters reappeared, etc. for example, when raskolnikov is walking around and sees m.

This English version still manages to capture the forcefulness and frightening intimacy as the Russian Dostoevsky's version, bringing it to a wider readership for the modern day. Fresh, contemporary and current this wonderful book is a delight to behold and which should be cherished for all-time, as a powerful piece of prose and stirring narrative that is profoundly affecting. Fyodor Dostoevsky s tale is brought realistically to life with such exactness that one cannot help but connect to it, by means of memorable characters and meaningful storytelling.For those who have vision and the courage to follow it, there is no law and no crime and no punishment, only a revaluation of all values.\\" So declares Rodya Raskolnikov the young Russian intellectual living in ugly poverty. In order to eat, he is forced to pawn precious possessions for a few roubles to the greedy \\"cockroach\\", Alyona. If he kills her, Rodya argues, he commits no crime: rather he will rid the world of a \\"filthy insect\\", just like one of the cockroaches you are able to envisage being crushed beneath his boots. As Alyona examines Rodya's silver cigarette case, he brings his axe down upon her with the horrifying sound of steel hitting human flesh. Despite this not being a crime, Rodya suffers fearful guilt and inevitable punishment. It is Sonya, the abused young woman forced into prostitution by her drunken father, who holds the power of Rodya's redemption.Dramatization is a superb vehicle for this tense psychological masterpiece and the performances are powerful (such as the baiting of Rodya by Jim Norton as Petrovich), the police officer who suspects Rodya's guilt, is chilling. Whilst Barnaby Kay skillfully conveys Rodya's duality as his human conscience, breathless with panic, argues with his controlled and truculent intellect transpire.Dramatic, intense and emotionally moving this noteworthy, inspiring tale in which you can feel such darkness and such passion is truly remarkable. I cannot stress enough the importance of having a good translator, and Constance Garnett has done a most credible job in making this as readable as a modern-day novel in the twentieth century that one is able to understand with decipherable language. Complete with an introduction by Joseph Frank, this has to be the stand-out edition of this masterful work of writing and which I highly recommend above all others (including those published by Penguin). This really is an epic story and one that should be revered and celebrated, for the value and worth of such great classics is beyond measure."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I posted a one star review in hopes that it gets read.I urge you to seek out the Norton's Critical edition of this book, ISBN: 0393956237That edition has portions of Dostoevsky's notebooks, many essays in criticism, and a list of all characters so that you can keep their different name iterations in order.In other words, Norton's Critical edition is the most thorough available, and if you value this book you should seek it out."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Would not download into my Kindle app in spite of repeated efforts. Done with Kindle for now. I will continue to use hardcopy books."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"No book in the history of books (that I've read) can swallow you whole like Crime and Punishment. When I was finally done reading this novel, I was a whole new person.I swear, from the first words on the first page I was already engulfed in the world of Raskolnikov. I had this horrible feeling int he pit of my stomach, I was uncomfortable, I was sad and depressed, I felt lonely and isolated... I felt everything he felt for the entirety of the novel. It was awful... but it was amazing! Who else can write like that? I'm telling you, in all the years that I have been reading (unassisted), I have never read a book like this, a book a would consider Dostoevsky's masterpiece.I know that Notes from Underground was a work of art, really, it was. I know that it takes years of studying and much knowledge to appreciate a said novel. I have also read The Brothers Karamazov, which, I gotta tell you, is also one of my favorite books of all time. But, just because The Brothers Karamazov has made it into my list of favorites, doesn't mean that it was Dostoevsky's best work.Crime and Punishment is dark and eerie. It's a horrible story that no one on Earth wants to identify with, yet you can't help feeling these uncanny similarities between you and this foreign character with whom you try to convince yourself you have nothing in common.At the beginning of this novel, the main character is torn and tormented. He is about to commit a crime. He must commit the crime, or so he has convinced himself. So, he successfully does what he has set out to do. This all happens in the first few chapters. While reading the first little bit, I remember thinking, 'This book is going to open my eyes to my own moral barometer. It's really gonna make me think about things I never really thought about.'The first few chapters brought me to that place where I was forced to think about what I would do, how I would feel, and so on. The most important question I struggled with was the same one Raskolnikov was plagued with: Had he changed his very nature permanently? If so, was there a way to undo it, or was he going to punish himself forever? Well, without giving too much away, he spent the next 900 pages in punishment. But the dialogue, the description, the emotion - it was all so other worldly, yet so close to home.I read this book at a pinnacle time in my life, and I think before I ever completed it, I had picked it up more than 3 times. It is a book that must be read in one's lifetime. However, when you read it is up to you. Pick it up, read the first little bit, see what gives. If the book doesn't strike you right away, put it down. Walk away. You'll be back. You'll be ready eventually, and when you are, this book will do for you what it did for me and so many before me: swallow you whole and spit you out new.Read more reviews at: www.projectzoug.blogspot.ca"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"An idea possessed Raskolnikov. He believed there are supermen, Newton's and Napoleon's, who transcend ordinary men and women, who could act without moral constraint to judge evil and levy punishment, and to determine whether he belonged to this superior race, he killed the greedy and usurious pawn-broker. But unlike Napoleon in Austerlitz he didn't execute his plan coldly and tactically. Rather, he nauseatingly dreamed his way into a double murder, the pawnbroker's sister had returned because he had tarried, and, at the sight of blood, was so terrified that his hands could not stop trembling. He discovered that he wasn't upright or courageous, that he could not transcend the law, and that he was just a louse, a member of the inferior class.As psychological fiction, Crime and Punishment showcases Raskolnikov's contradictory actions and emotions that revealed a split psyche fighting for wholeness. He despised others but was preoccupied with bringing about good. After reading his mother's letter about his sister's misfortune, he shed sympathetic tears but also donned an evil spiteful smile. He gave the little he had to help the Marmeladovs but immediately regretted helping them. He killed the pawnbroker to prove an idea but took her money and valuables. He was detached in the first interview with the head detective Porfiry but in the second was angry and spiteful toward him.His punishment did not begin in Siberia after the verdict but immediately after killing the pawnbroker, his irritability, nervousness, suspiciousness, delusion, and mania tormenting an already fragile psyche, not allowing him to eat, drink, sleep, work or socialize, and pressing him to hide in his coffin-like apartment trying escaping from reality and to curl up under his blanket, feverish and delusional. His conscience was tormenting and implicating him even before the law did so. Only through Sonya's help and guidance was he able to find strength to confess his crime.Through this novel's outcome, Dostoyevsky rejected any social system that tried to replace the jagged path of life with linear reason to save people from their predicament. Although the author's moral heavy-handedness in Raskolnikov's repentance and redemption seemed to scar the artistry of the mental battle, Crime and Punishment is psychological novel at its best."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel analyzes the idea of justice and those who seek it. The novel's main character, Rodion Raskolnikov has a skewed idea of the purpose of justice and loses his sanity in his application of this. The evolution of what justice is in Raskolnikov and his search to figure out his own role of justice shape the statement that Dostoevsky is making about the application of personal justice in real life; it is not a man's place to decide he is more important than others.Raskolnikov adapts a personal opinion of justice that some men are better than others. He plays off of Nietzsche's super man theory. Raskolnikov feels that some men are extraordinary and that their actions are exempt from moral standards. This novel is greatly making a statement about this theory since Raskolnikov's downfall was in its application. The search for justice and what justice truly is forms a large part of this novel. Raskolnikov forms and tests out his own theory. When he does test it he realizes his ideology is horrifically wrong and is pushed past the point of sanity because of it. He eventually finds redemption in accepting his guilt and justice. Life in this novel is the search for justice and the way justice can effect every part of life.This novel was an enjoyable read. Once you get past the Russian names, it is not difficult either. The mixture of crime and the emotions that go along with crimes is greatly intriguing. I highly recommend this novel, especially to those who love great literature and murder stories."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The freebie is the Constance Garrett translation, which is well regarded by many.

Needless to say, Dostoyevsky does this better than anyone. Onto The Idiot!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the first Dostoevsky book I have read, and I liked it immensely. I decided to read it because of the intriguing plot, as well as Dostoevsky's reputation. Something interesting about this novel is that Dostoevsky used a very &quot;backwards&quot; sort of character development. He had Raskolnikov commit a murder- with no apparent motive- and then spent the rest of the book exploring the character, rather than the other way around. So first we watch this character commit a horrible, terrible crime, one that we should denounce him for, and then we begin to get to know him, and he is revealed to have an astoundingly good character after all. I found myself liking Raskolnikov greatly, and I was able to identify with him as well. However, this book does not seem to fall under the guidelines of a &quot;crime novel&quot; nor a &quot;psychological thriller&quot;. Yes, there is a crime, as well as a study of the protoganist's psyche, but it is not exactly thrilling. This is not the sort of story where you have to keep reading and reading to find out who committed the crime. You already know. Therefore, there is no mystery to keep you interested. Despite all these obstacles, Dostoevsky does what might be impossible for most writers. He makes you care about what happens to Raskolnikov. I was not thrilled, but engrossed. What kept me reading here was the desire to see if Raskolnikov would defeat his inner demons and turn himself in, or be arrested. I'd rather not reveal the ending but I would like to say that I found it extremely satisfying. The subplot, that of Luzhin trying to gain control over Dounia, might have only gotten in the way of another writer, but Dostoevsky was able to inspire such hate in me for Luzhin that I wanted to keep reading just to see him get what he deserved in the end. After reading this, I have decided to read Dostoevky's other works as well, and hopefully they will all be of the same high quality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Just magnificent.

Compare the scene in Crime and Punishment, where Raskolnikov is telling Sonia he committed the murder (around pages 320-330). &quot;I wanted to have the daring,&quot; he says, as his motive. Or in the Brothers Karamazov, where Father Zosima (spelling?) tells about his older brother's death (page 302 or so in the Garnett hardcover translation). &quot;Run along now.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov was looking for the proof of the moral law, but he couldn't understand that the moral law DIDN'T NEED any proof. This is the law of consience. This is the law of God."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky takes human consciousness into the realm of murderous action, a masterful vision told with a richness of language that has no equal in all of literature. As in his other work, he expounds upon the contemplation of his characters; however, the reader is now presented with a man who acts upon his convictions. Like Joseph Conrad's Colonel Kurtz, Raskolnikov's soul is plunged into darkness, a mental anguish that serves as his true punishment. But the most striking theme is one of redemption, brought about through the grace and compassion of a prostitute, an earthly angel. It is here that the genius of the novel lies, in the mystic realism that finds salvation in the depths of depravity.It is disturbing that such a prolific novel should be looked down upon simply because it is seen as boring or \\"fit only for the intellectual.\\" The length of the book serves to expand upon the thoughts of the character. We live in a world where sound bytes have become our sense of the world. If something can't be read in a night or compressed into a downloadable file, we quickly disregard it. True, Crime and Punishment is both long and dense, but every word is necessary. This book was not written for the intellectual classes, but rather for the masses of nineteenth century Russia. During his lifetime, Dostoevsky was not only a great writer, but a successful one as well. His most vital characters come from the lower classes of his society. Prostitutes, servants, and drunkards all make up his mysticism, representing every aspect of the human condition."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I expected this novel to be dense and hard to understand, but it wasn't. I got into it from the first sentence, and it was quite easy to read. Dostoevsky creates an actual human being in Raskolnikov. The reader is transported into his mind; he sees the motivations for the &quot;Crime&quot; and feels the torture of the &quot;Punishment.&quot; The novel NEVER becomes boring. Dostoevsky even includes plot twists which I shall not reveal. Even in this great novel, he pays attention to plot, a compelling plot. The NBC movie was horrible in comparison, so please do not judge the novel on that basis.

Each time it has captivated me even more, the subtlety, the Russian nuances, the statement, all uniquely Russian. Dostoyevsky was a product of his times, his culture, and his beloved city, not to be compared to other European authors of his era because Russia and it's artists were like no others in the world, the history completely seperate from much which is considered European. His prose is timeless. To learn of the Russia of today read its authors of yesterday."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I think it's one of the most usefull books in the world, because it is about the cost of one's life it is about the humanity. Raskolnikov is just an unhappy person, he's unhappy because of his idea, because he IS ABLE TO KILL, because he is mistaken thinking that the world is divided into two parts: the part of slavers and the part of owners and rulers, because he believes in Napoleon and do not in God. All people who allow theirselves to decide who will be alive and who won't are also unhappy persons, like Raskolnikov. Dostoyevsky gave his hero a chance to revival by Sonya, by love, by God, and Raskolnikov used this chance. I hope all unhappy and cruel people will have one..."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation, as Thoureau would say. The reviewer who can give a work of Dostoevsky's one star is no better than the Nazi's who burn books because they cannot stand the sight of it. I've not only grown up with this book, but rereading it (the Pevear, Volokhonsky version is the best) again 14 years later, has revealed to me the true power and insight in it which I did not detect before.

Sublime, unflinching, deep characters."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read the book Crime and Punishment. I found it to be a very interesting book. Although I didn't like how they paid so much attention to detail, I could have gone with out knowing what clothes people wore. Aside from that it was very well written. I enjoyed the whole psychiatric view of the murder. It really fascinated me how Raskolnikov's mind worked, how he thought he was an &quot;extraordinary man&quot;. In a way I agreed with him, he was doing well in some sense, but how he did it was all wrong. No one is extraordinary enough to get away with murder, I can't believe that he thought he would. I knew as soon as I started reading the book that Raskolnikov was not right in the head. The book also had some little side stories like Marmeladov's family, I couldn't find the connection. I guess the death of Marmeladov was supposed to make Raskolnikov think. But overall I really enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A masterful view into the mind of one who strongly feels that he is justified by committing murder. Is Raskolnikov aware that the clever detective knows about his crime? Raskolnikov quickly becomes plagued by his unrelenting guilty conscience. The suspense was wonderful as the detective persistently hounded Rasknolikov and finally pushed him to the breaking point. I guess that confession is truly good for the soul as the main character experiences tremendous relief following his admission. It is then a life of grief and misery for Rasknolikov living in prison with what he has done. One must be prepared to deal with the consequences of one's own actions. This is Russian literature at it's very best and I thoroughly enjoyed this enduring classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"no one talks of money better tha Dostoevsky. Once again, I am amazed with the general surroundings and family setting this book offers. Where else could you find such a taunt read? No where."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky is a master at adding plot twists and irony to an already original plot. Nothing like this story has been the high standards that this one has set."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostovevsky's analysis of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is brilliant-every last tinge of emotion is captured and portrayed in such a way as we can relate to the intricately detailed workings of the criminal mind and reach an understanding of the character.....absolutely brilliant, to be read on both a literal level, and to be studied on a deeper one."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Amazing, heart-wrenching, and thouroughly a novel which explores the extent to which the mind can be twisted. The young student Raskolnikov is an insane mixture of hero and villain, brought down by his own brilliance and his, as it were, character flaw. This novel is the epitomy of superiority versus the inevitable, unchangable cycles of life. His theories are to be reckoned with; however, they can only remain theories, as he later learns, for no human has the capabilities to truly look past his conscious, if there is one present. That is the hero. The villain in Raskolnikov is really only his flawed concept of himself, of his deranged confusion of himself and Napoleon, of a great deed and an extremely obsolete attempt at overcoming human boundaries. Much like Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, Dostoevsky explores a depth of the human mind which he himself quite possibly cannot fully comprehend. It's worth the time to read this novel, for you soon become fully immersed in the twisted logic of such a simple, yet so very complicated story."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment ReviewThere is a hero and villain in all of us. But is there a \\"Superman\\" effect. Fyodor Dostoyevky's book, Crime and Punishment, proves this. The theme of this story has to do with a man named Raskolnikov and how he thinks he murdered somebody for the right reason. He doubts his actions after this murder and consoles G-d in doing so. Raskolnikov needs an answer to this question and in this is the theme of the book: are we heros or villains in the actions that we take to save others or ourselves?At the beginning of the novel, Raskolnikov sees himself as a \\"superman,\\" a person who is extraordinary and thus above the moral rules that govern the rest of humanity. His exaggerated estimation of himself compels him to separate himself from society. His murder of the pawnbroker is a consequence of his belief that he is above the law. Raskolnikov's inability to calm his additional feelings of guilt proves to him that he is not a \\"superman.\\" Although he realizes his failure to live up to what he has envisioned for himself, he is nevertheless unwilling to accept the total creation of this identity. He continues to resist the idea that he is as average as the rest of humanity by maintaining to himself that the murder was justified. It is only in his final surrender to his love for Sonya, and his realization of the joys in such surrender, that he can finally escape his conception of himself as a superman and the terrible isolation such a belief brought upon him.In this Raskolnikov also looks to G-d for assistance. He calls upon G-d to see if he can lead him to the right conclusion. Along with this G-d is leading him to confess his sins to Sonya the niece of the pawnbroker and to the police to be a free man. He also looks upon his friend for guidance, and his friend listens, unknowing of the murder, and tries to lean him toward the path of redemption.At the end of the novel Raskolnikov confesses his sins to Sonya. She in turn tells him he must tell these things to the police, and is merciful to him. As he goes he kisses the ground one last time because this will be the last time for a while that he will be on the outside. And in jail he finds love with Sonya and soon after in a few years he is released from prison and is happy with Sonya his new love. Raskolnikov and Sonya show that society is merciful on some who are this hopeless and have a clouded mind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"While reading Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment again, I realized that the book was actually pretty good.Dostoyevsky does a good job of bringing the characters to life, whether it be the crazed psychopath Rodion Raskolnikov, the incorrigible prick Svidrigailov, or the prostitute Sonia.Dostoyevsky also brings the setting to life, putting them in St. Petersburg during a time when an intellectual \\"revival\\" was taking place- a \\"revival\\" that the young tragic hero, Raskolnikov,finds himself in.All in all, a good book and a real classic for the ages. A 5/5."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"i first read this book in russian and then carried on to read it in english. dostoyevky's style is naturally rather slow but meaningful and that is how the novel progresses. not much happens but the theme you absorb is incredible. the themes of rejection of human nature and isolation from society and the \\"superhuman\\" prospect make the book so interesting. the story is depressing, as are most russian novels, but so captivating! dostoyevsky is brilliant!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"From everything I had ever heard about Crime and Punishment, I thought it was either going to be incredibly slow and plodding, or utterly fascinating and deep.Interestingly, I thought it was both.Dostoesvsky's writing is intense. It is almost exactly what you expect a \\"classic\\" to be. It is brilliant, insightful and precise. More than that, it is *real*--it forces you to reflect on yourself, and the world, and can teach you things about both. It really is the psychological masterpiece everyone says it is, as it dives deeply into the mind of a murderer.Also, however, it is wordy--because it is so precise, it sometimes takes a long time to say what it is trying to say. This can be dull on occasion, and makes it a hard book to read late into the night. When you read Crime and Punishment, you will *feel* as though you're reading a classic, unlike experiences I've had reading authors like Tolstoy, Dumas, Dickens, Twain and others where eventually I just felt like I was reading a story.And so, your experience reading Crime and Punishment will largely depend on what features of a novel are most important to you. If you are drawn to novels because of their fast paced, exciting plots and energetic characters, give this one a pass. If, however, you read novels for their illuminations of human nature, then this might just be the book for you. Like I say, it is certainly a classic novel... but not everyone will enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Usually, I am skeptical about the classics. They typically bore me with a lack of plot or boring imagery. Not this book. Dostoevsky masterfully draws you into each and every character in the book, providing uncanny detail in every interaction that takes place. In reading this, before I knew it, I was immersed in a web of philosophical and psychological interchange that can excite any reader. Everything bad I heard about this book was not true at all."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is moving on many levels: fantastic writing, interesting insight into the human psyche and the effect of our actions on our lives. The character moves through many transitions and it is fascinating to watch. I re-read this book every few years. Historically, we can see into the bleakness of many lives in a repressed Russia, and the characters all looking over their shoulders with paranoia and cynicism. The human condition is well highlighted here. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is generally acknowledged as one of the great works of Literature and perhaps after 'The Brothers Karamazov ' Dosteovsky's second best work. I did not like the work, and not because I did not find parts of it absorbing and moving. I do not like crime. I do not like murder and violence. I found it difficult to sympathize with Raskolnikov and understand why I should give somuch of my attention to such a person. The murder of the old woman is in my perhaps simplistic mind, an evil for which one should be silenced. Instead we get hundreds of pages of the hero's remorse. If I were asked what I really remember about the work it is the confession of the drunken character who tells his whole life story and suffering to a total stranger. The dialogue of Dostoevsky is always one of his strong points, and in this speech too one feels great power. The suffering of the child, the single child which stands out against the Heavens as evidence of an unjust world and God also moved me deeply. I admit I am far from the best reader of this work. Dostoevsky has always repelled me a bit even before I knew of his anti- Semitism. The fascination with the morbid and the criminal has never been mine. But the power of the work and the word and the comprehension of character and experience are very great indeed. I suggest the reader turn to far other reviews for more full and more objective informatiion."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I, personally, found the Brothers Karamazov better in many ways, but the themes in Crime and Punishment come out more loudly than in the BK which come out extremely loudly in themselves. A university student justifies the murder of an old woman who is a cold and cruel pawn shop owner. For the next few days the student, Raskolnikov, struggles with his feelings of remorse, guilt, doubt, etc. until he gives in for the sake of others, though he doesnt consciously recognize it and some might disagree. It is a marvelous work on the human psychy and a must read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I won't spend time praising this amazing novel as much has already been said. But British actor Jennings does a superb job reading (or should I say recreating) Dostoyevsky's classic. Now that I've heard this version I can't imagine anyone else narrating it. As audiobook enthusiasts know, the reader can make or break a good book. This is one not to miss."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm not fantastically well-read, but to imply that this book is somehow inferior (as one review has), because it makes use of such 'embarassingly conventional' techniques as PLOT, is kinda arrogant.'Crime and punishment' is able to integrate the readers' logic with the emotive as a way to illuminate his philosophical preoccupations which are by no means trite. (And anyways, for Dostoevesky's time, the style of writing is far less elaborate than, say...Tolstoy or Dickens).You can read this as simply a thrilling crime drama, but more than that, it delivers an essay on meaning in modernity. You may scoff at its end implications ( by all means, please do), but i believe it was written by a refined artistic mind--no post-modern cynic could hope to equal such an achievement. ever... so filled with smug contempt that the Literary Snob is incapable of producing anything with sincerity and truth."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is about one important question that all of us should ask:Can a human life (no matter how &quot;worthless&quot;) be sacrificed for some noble ideal?Raskolnikov learns the answer through a very painful process.I've read this book two years ago, and Dostoyevsky became one of my favourite authors. Since then, I read almost all the rest of his work and it seems to me that together they form one big universe of thought and feelings. It is so wide, I find it almost impossible for a reader to fully penetrate his universe. When a reader gets there through his works, there is one thing to be seen: unlimited sincerety. Dostoyevsky doesn't hide himself from the reader and many things he wrote are parallel to his own painful life."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Quite possibly the best book I have ever read. Its sadness and spirit comes through vividly in all but the thickest translations, and it never slows down, emotionally or intellectually. It was said that &quot;if your favorite author is Stephen King or John Grisham then skip this book&quot; Nonsense! It is accessible and exciting. A book everyone should read. Enjoy it like I did"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The poor boy lacked the intestinal fortitude to live with his actions. The book is typical of the excellent 19th Century Russian abilty to create interesting, larger than life characters and a good plot. To me, this book was a look at Napoleon, another 19th Century Russian obsession. Raskolnikov is the Russian Napoleon. He is not the average man, but a young demi-god who has the right to take his just desserts. However, unlike Napoleon he cannot bring the moral reality into line with the intellectual superiority. In classic Russian fashion he second guesses his actions and questions his right to take action at all (after having committed the act, naturally). The subject matter and the writing all come together to make this book what it is recognized to be - a classic"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is THE BEST book I've ever read. Dostoevsky is agenius, he describes the feelings and emotions of hischaracters in such way, it makes his readers actually gothrough what his characters are going through. I wouldrecommend everyone to read this wonderfull book!!!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is a painful, but worthwhile read, as it explores the mind of the kind-hearted Raskolnikov and his psychological journey to hell amidst poverty and corruption. Somehow, Dostoyevsky's magical ability to play with words forces the reader to like Raskolnikov and to attempt to justify his evil actions. Suspenseful and exhausting, the reader will find Raskolnikov's sins and redemption to be overwhelming and awe-inspiring in this must-read-classic"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this right after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone;the two are quite different, as you can imagine. Crime and Punishment is a very good study of human psychology, as well as a wonderful peek into the social castes of 19th century Russia. I did not study this book in a literature class, and enjoyed it as a straight work of fiction that was very compelling in its own right, without the attendant analyses, etc. Each character is brought vividly to life, almost none are perfect, but all have stories and histories worth reading about.In addition, the underlying &quot;new&quot; theory suggested in the book cannot be more provocative: Are some people so &quot;extraordinary&quot; (enlightened) that it is alright for them to kill if this brings more general benefit to society? The answer was obvious to me, but it is an interesting question nevertheless."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm 4/5 the way through this book, and haven't been able to put it down. It's a page turner. I agree with all the wonderful positive things stated prior to my review, but I have to point out that I find the translation confusing, or sloppy. (Not that I could do any better). But here's my points:* Some characters seem to have alternative names. For example, In one moment, you may see a character referred to as \\"Luzhin\\", and later as \\"Pytor Petrovitch\\". (Page 151 and other places) This doesn't happen in conversation with other characters which might make some sense, but from the third person narrative. There are, I think, at least two other characters I encountered with the \\"alternative name\\" issue. In addition, there is an easy one : \\"Sonia\\" vs \\"Sofya\\". Unless you happen to know that Sonia is familiar for Sofya, you might be lost for a bit.EDIT: Finally, at page 376 I saw \\"Pytor Petrovitch Luzhin\\", which identified this characters full name, at last.* Some completely different and unrelated characters have the same last name! This led to a lot of confusion too. Katerina Ivanovna is the name of a ill woman, Alyona Ivanovna is the murdered pawnbroker, Amalia Ivanovna is Katerina's landlady. Amalia Ivanovna also is referred to by the author as Ludwignovna.There is another, too, I believe.Where does this confusion come from? Is it me? or the author? or the translator? Did I miss some familial connection between all those Ivanovna's?; or does this name reoccur with that kind of frequency in Russia? Or was the translator sloppy? EDIT: Could \\"Ivanovna\\" be some kind of commonly used address?* During an interview between the Hero, and the detective, (and this scene and so many others are terrific btw!) the detective seems to have a nervous laugh which comes out as \\"he-he-he\\"--- a lot. Annoying as such a laugh is, it's forgivable and not really disconcerting because I just figured this character has a nervous little silly laugh. However, later on, the stern, mean old Luzhin who has never laughed until this late point in the book has a conversation wherein he laughs several times. \\"he-he-he\\". Is \\"he-he-he\\" a good translation of whatever Doestoevsky used to denote laughing? If not, then the translator has maligned the characters by giving them a ridiculous laugh.But I am VERY impressed with the book. The characters are indeed 3d, as has been said. They all seem real to me. The suspense is wonderful. The several story lines going on at once is well done! Multi-faceted story and multi-faceted characters. I love this book, because I never know where it's going to. At one point, I said, \\"aha! Luzhin's probably going to try to kill Raskolnikov. Now I'll watch that unfold!\\" and something else totally happened, which was even better. Of course, he may yet! (I've only read 4/5ths so far, you know.)If you're in the mood for this book--i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"ITS RELEVANCEHow can a story written in 1860's Russia about a student who slays an old spinster with an axe be relevant today? Can we not easily dismiss the story itself and especially the ending as being just a facile and vacuous fantasy of a hopeless ninteenth century romantic? It depends a little on whether one is more interested in questions well asked or in getting simple answers.What is Man? What motivates him? What is the basis of right action? These are central motivating questions in Crime and Punishment. One hypothesis is that a person can define his own life and live entirely on those terms. The alternative hypothesis is that this strategy isolates by successively cutting off one relationship after another until nothing is left, not even sanity. Dostoevsky suggests in this novel that action can only be viewed in a social context, not a purely individualistic one. And that action is rightly motivated by care and personal connection instead of by theory, fear, or desparation.In Dostoevsky's view of the world relationships are horizontal, familial, almost communal. It's a point of view he shares with several of his contemporary countrymen. In this view of the world, relationships are not part of life; they are not essential to life; they are life. They define it. Outside of relationships there is no life.This idea is, perhaps, more deeply embedded in the Russian psyche than that of any other group of Europeans because in the vast and unforgiving land that is Russia such a viewpoint is necessary for survival. Life as an individual is a meaningless idea because it will likely not outlast an open bottle of good champagne in a thirsty crowd.Individualism has been ensconced in most of western philosophy, political thought, and law for more than two millenia. It has revolved around the idea of the solitary individual as an isolatable entity. Not just isolatable for the purposes of analysis but actually as an entity that lives beyond society, without connection to other social beings. The trajectory of Anglophone society since WWII has been toward the increasingly individualistic. Society grows more efficient every day at transforming its individuals from social beings into Skinner's girl in the closet or Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov.The kind of isolation suffered by Raskolnikov is endemic to today's sprawling suburban deserts, crumbling small towns, and dysfunctional urban areas. And the dysfunction caused by this isolation makes possible the explanation of a collection notorious antisocial acts from bombings to handgun massacres. At first blush we might imagine Raskolnikov's more immediate motivation to be different; but it is fear and hatred that drive him. So again, Raskolnikov's motivations are profoundly similar to the fear, hatred and isolation that drive today's seemingly random acts of violence and far too many of its political machinations.THE STORYIn ninteenth century St. Petersburg, there lives a young university student named Raskolnikov who has run out of money, He has been separated from his family for three years. His impulsive sensibility to help others has left him in penury and unable to persue his studies, His miserable material condition, his idleness, and his and isolation begin to take a toll on him.Just as things reach a critical point he learns that his sister has become engaged to a rich politician who, he discerns, wishes to marry her for despicable psychological reasons. He determines that although his sister would live in a wealthy household, her husband's attitude would make her miserable for every minute they both might live. He imagines she is throwing away her life and happiness so he might complete his studies. And he cannot endure the thought of it.He must rescue her. To do so requires capital. He has few choices. But for some time he has been considering a plan. There is a wretched old shrewish woman, a pawnbroker, a foreigner, who lives with her niece. She is mean and spiteful. All the people who live in the neighborhood believe so. Raskolnikov wonders whether he should kill her and make off with her small fortune.In studying history he has learned that all great men get to be so through bold and unconventional action - usually involvong the spilling of blood. New systems of government are always built upon dead bodies. New enterprises launched on the backs of the oppressed. If a man must kill one person to save a hundred, he reasons, would he not do it? And, he imagines, this old woman is not a person. And, anyway she is old and might expire any day.Raskolnikov rehearses. He has bad dreams. In a fit of fever and pique he does the deed, goes home and collapses on his couch. The book really begins as he wakes up out of a three day fit of delerium. The central conflict quickly becomes when and how Raskolnikov will come to grips with his actions.But before this can happen, the fortunes of half a dozen central characters must be resolved in ways that frame Raskolnikov's actions and attitudes. His sister must be successfully separated from her manipulative fiance, his friend must be rewarded for the goodness of his very being. The sad fate of the orphaned Marmeladov family must be resolved, and so on.Dostoevsky is quite masterful in drawing us into the thoughts, attitudes, and psychological states of Raskolnikov. It was interesting to read this novel immediately after reading Conrad's Heart of Darkness, The commentator for that book was convinced that Conrad must have been profoundly influenced by this one; it's an inescapable conclusion. Both authors are very interested in psychology as a motive force in storytelling. Both care much about presenting a coherent and cohesive psychological portrait of their characters. Dostoevsky is more open about it, creating a prosecutor named Porfiry who plays a psychological game of cat and mouse with Raskolnikov, carefully explaining to him the psycology of each move.Throughout the book Dostoevsky implicitly asks \\"What motivates us? Is it fear? Is it love? Is it superstition? Desire? Hatred? Duty? The desire to win, to have the upper hand? The will to power? Want of money?\\" and by extension, \\"What ought to motivate us?\\" And each character shows us a little bit about what his creator believes the consequence of his own motivation might be. Whether we find Dostoevsky's conclusions convincing or not, the questions are well asked and his point of view well illustrated. We stand to learn much from his point of view."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"if you expect this to be of the same caliber as 'the brothers karamazov', then you would be disappointed. it doesn't come close. the story is slow. it took the whole book to brew and reaping only takes place on the last chapter (ch.2 of epilogue). this is where you get what idea, in its entirety, dostoevsky is trying to convey. until you get to the final chapter, you'll keep reading and waiting. when you finish reading the final chapter you'll say 'it's a GOOD book.' then you close the book and lay back and think and reflect on what dostoevsky is trying to imply...then you'd say 'what a GREAT book!' i give it 4/5 in general and 2.5/5 relative to 'the brothers karamazov'."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'll be very brief with a fresh idea. First off, the book is a great work of literature and a very good read. I needn't say more in that department as the other 5 star reviews here cover it well.But my theory is that publishers wanted long novels as being more marketable rather than novellas or short stories. I think that influenced the writing of Dostoyevsky, Joseph Conrad and others. Although extremely well written, my view is that there is some padding in the story here as there also was to an even greater extent in the Brothers Karamazov.I would be more in favor of \\"tight story telling\\"."},{"Title":"Private Jimmy Boyd's War: A Story of Co. a 10th New Jersey","review":"Jimmy Boyd was a real person. Like many of his age, he was swept up in the early romanticism of the Civil War and would do anything to join the Union Army -- including lie about his age and run away from home (not an uncommon way to volunteer).He joined the 10th New Jersey Volunteers and was off to \\"see the elephant\\" (as big adventures were idiomized at the time). Boyd drilled, trained, learned army life and saw battle in 1864 and 1865.Like some on both sides, Boyd deserted after the horror of a wounding and the death around him became too much. He hid in a Pennsylvania outhouse, was befriended by a local girl (who he later returned to marry), caught, returned to his unit and saw the end of the war with Sheridan in the Valley and through Appomattox.This short book is written for children of about 5th grade or so. It gives a good account of life in the Union army, the frightening reality of war and a good depiction of how a young person deals with their own failings and restoration. In addition, the years before Jimmy enlists are covered, giving the reader a window on small farm life at that time.The book does have a glossary, which is helpful. I think it would have been a little more accessible for young readers had the terms been parenthetically described in the text, but that is a minor quibble. All in all a good book that may fuel the young person's interest in the Civil War."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"This audio set is a great resource for picking up Spanish after not speaking or studying it since high school.

I have used Rosetta Stone at all five levels. It is a great program but I left it having a broad vocabulary and understanding of how the language worked but very little on how to speak in a conversation. Pimsleur has been great for teaching the basics of carrying on a meaningful conversation. I highly recommend it for those who are audio learners. If you learn best visually you might buy with caution. I plan to buy at least one more level of Pimsleur."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"This was recommended by someone I work with.

Now because of this slow pace and focus on core vocab and repetition you don't get very far (but you do get somewhere, don't worry).For this reason I would not recommend this course for someone who already has some Spanish background.

It would have been easier (and cheaper, I'll get to that in a sec) and more effective to actually pay for lessons. First of all, CD's. Had they sold it as a digital download, it'd be less of a hassle to copy it down to your ipod or mp3 player, and even then skipping the parts you've already done takes forever.Secondly, they send you a second box, one which, if you dont return it, they charge you an additional $300 dollars. I cancelled mine and asked them for a shipping address, but they just extended my trial and said they'd send me an email before the extension ends so I could call again. No further email came and I was charged all that. I called them up explaining the situation and they said they couldnt help me and i'd be charged regardless. I'm selling that box on amazon to make up for the loss. All in all DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I read the reviews for this product and was a bit angered at some of the negative reviews so I wanted to write my own.Some say this product isn't great, but I really disagree. One said it's only for beginners--YES! If you don't know Spanish, this is a great way to start.I bought a Pimsleur course for Cantonese years ago before traveling to Hong Kong and I loved it. Even with the limited number of words and phrases I knew, I felt comfortable going into the remotest areas of the New Territories, where no English was spoken and thanks to Pimsleur I could ask for some things and even ask a waitress to take a photo of me and my dad.The same is true for Spanish. I bought this program because my fiancee is from Ecuador and I seem to be traveling to various Spanish speaking countries a lot now to meet her. I recently went to Panama while in the midst of the Pimsleur lessons.This was my third trip there and what a difference I felt knowing more Spanish thanks to Pimsleur. I was able to carry on a conversation with the taxi driver, the bartender at my hotel, and people in stores. I went on a tour with some people from other countries including Spain and Venezuela and could speak some to them too!No, my Spanish is not perfect, but I felt such a sense of power in that I was able to do things I wasn't able to previously. What a tremendous amount of freedom.This is just an introduction and you'll need to keep studying to learn more and increase your fluency, but the Pimsleur approach has really been the best for me. I have Rosetta Stone, but I got bored with it. I don't like clicking on one word at a time. I want to hear conversations--and Pimsleur give that to me. That's why, based on my success with the Cantonese program, I bought the Spanish one.I also like that they don't go over grammar, etc., but just give you conversations. You can figure the grammar out once you are familiar with the sentences. And as you learn new words, you can use the tools you have from this program to create new sentences.I have found that by just having a conversation with those people you meet in Spanish speaking countries and letting them know that your Spanish is not the greatest, they help you. They give you the word you're looking for and you add it to your vocabulary.I will continue with Pimsleur and will probably buy the big collection for further study. I can't recommend this one highly enough."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"The Pimsleur is \`a way' to learn a language and I have found it a fair way. I bought the Spanish II book.Method.I am terrible linguist. Thus, I need repetition of words and phrases in both pronunciation and use of grammar. The Pimsleur method seems to introduce a word or phrase, repeat it, introduce a new topic, and then continually circle back to the older learning topics, though to a lesser degree throughout the lessons. It is good method since you meet the same subject again and again in the succeeding lessons. It helps people, like me, to remember a topic. If the method studied one topic and move on without the circle back, I would have forgotten the prior topic. In essence, you are building on the older topics and re-learning them again. Due to this method, you will not build a large vocabulary. Thus, like any subject, you have to supplement it with self-study if you wish to have a functional understanding.Production. It is a good product. You have four voices to keep you awake. I have no idea if the pronunciation is good but it is clear and it is probably Castilian. A drawback is that the CD has only two tracks of 30 minutes. If for some reason, you stop the player and the CD must restart (such as in car), you have to start at the beginning. In a way, that this limitation forces you to give the lesson undivided attention for 30 minutes.Support. The product has no written material. I guess it is the Pimsleur method for you to focus on speaking and hearing. This is the hardest part of the language education for me since I like written language better. However, I think there should be a vocabulary card for self-study before the lessons. I built flash cards."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a very good program.

You'll learn the numbers (up to a hundred), how to tell time, how to order a generic beer (almost every lesson spends considerable time on this), and how to ask where a hotel or restaurant is.But if the hotel is not \\"right here\\" or \\"over there,\\" (the only possible answers, apparently) you'll have no clue. Forget about \\"turn left at the intersection and continue for two-and-a-half blocks.\\" You can order a beer, but forget about a salad, the daily special, what the waiter recommends, a steak, some chicken, or tea or a soft drink.You can go shopping but unless you want to buy \\"things\\" you'll come back with nothing. Nada! \\"Cosas\\" [things] is the only thing covered! Forget shirts, dresses, pants, maps, guides, film, cameras, books, hats. Forget about buying a plane ticket, a train ticket, asking for help, asking what's playing, finding the beach, a nightclub, a doctor, a cop, or even checking into the hotel that was conveniently \\"over there.\\"To get any truly useful survival skills with this approach, these eight disks would need to be followed by at least a hundred others. And with three hundred disks practiced over two years, I have no doubt you'd even be able to converse on a variety of topics, which I believe was Pimsleur's intention. But Pimsleur's eight disks is so tragically short of qualifying for tourist survival Spanish, that it's comical, as long as you're not the one using it.There are better ways to learn, but they will require more effort on your part, such as drilling yourself on phrases, learning vocabulary, and (gasp!) some grammar. I would recommendEasy Spanish Step-By-Stepfor grammar and essential vocabulary, and probablyTeach Yourself Spanish Complete Course (Book + 2CD's) (Teach Yourself Language Complete Courses)(orTeach Yourself Latin American Spanish Complete Course) for audio, and adequate survival phrases. For getting beyond very basic, stock phrases, listen to the podcasts at notesinspanish.com. Don't neglect the multitude of other resources available to you there and elsewhere on the Internet as well.Pimsleur's disks are still quite useful for practicing the sounds with time to repeat ... I'd recommend borrowing them rather than buying if that's an option. If not, you might try the course that inspired Pimsleur at fsi-languages.com, which is completely free."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I purchased the Pimsleur's Conversational Spanish CD set with 18 lessons (not sure if this is the same, but close). I am a military brat and stand true to the belief that learning another language should start at the early elementary age. I retained more Japanese in 3 years, 24 years ago, than 3 years of studying Spanish at the high school level. Being in the construction industry, the hispanic community and workers have flourished, and with that my need to communicate with them. I have bought and tried other types of audio Spanish teaching media, but the Pimsleur's method is truly the only one that actually teaches you to think for yourself, which is what is actually going to happen when your in a conversation. To start with a conversation, and not memorizing all the verbs and their tenses and numbers, etc has made this very enjoyable and wanting to buy the entire volume. (I called directly today to order.) It's like starting to play an instrument: you don't want to learn all the scales and how to read music, you just want to be able to play a song or two right away, and that's what this Conversational Spanish does."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I bought Pimsleur's Conversational Spanish in hopes of addressing my greatest deficiency in the language: the art of conversation. After reading so many positive reviews, I certainly thought that the product would help to that end. Sadly, though, its sixteen lessons stay on a very basic level, culminating with learning how to say \\"seventy\\" and \\"We want to eat with you,\\" words and phrases I did not need a cd to teach me.If you are starting without any Spanish background, this may be a good, practical item to buy.

It's very, very basic, so if you know any Spanish you'll be frustrated. It also encourages you to call Spanish by its Castillian name, but avoids Castillian pronunciations (so what's the point? And won't most American customers be going to Mexico, where they don't speak with a Castillian accent?) Moreover, it has the usual assortment of bizarro conversations and statements (I have a lot of pesos at the hotel), including endless practice of saying \\"I am a Mexican, Ecuadorian\\" etc. 1. I'm never going to say this. 2. I get the general idea after a few repetitions. The strong suit of Pimsleur is that you learn what you learn very well, with excellent pronunciation. The weak suit is that you don't build a lot of useful vocabulary. I can now say, with near perfect pronunciation, \\"I speak a little (Mandarin, German, Spanish), but I don't speak it well.\\" But I can't have much of a conversation in any of these languages beyond that."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"Exactly what I was looking for! I drive to work, roughly 45 minutes each way, and always wanted this time not to be wasted. The length of lessons fits right-in with some 5 minutes to spare in case of an interrupting phone call. The course assume absolutely no off-time studying and no usage of printed material whatsoever. Additionally, being alone in a car, I am the most comfortable about pronouncing sentences aloud, compared to being in a real class (this I remember from my years at University) or at home with my family around (as of now, this would be the only other option).The pauses after English prompts are just right. On rare occasions when I get destructed and miss a moment to try my Spanish guess, there is always time to repeat the Spanish after the recorded voice before the next English prompt comes in. New words and expressions are naturally mixed in with repeated ones from previous lessons, making ideal byte sizes of new material in every next lesson while keeping you from forgetting what's learned before.There are 16 lessons in total. Of course, you can not stuck it all in your head in 16 sessions. If I feel that I miss more than 10% of prompts, I jump couple of lessons back. I had to jump to 4 after the first series of 1 to 6, then back to 6 after getting to 8 for the first time and so on. I went over number 12 today and feel confident about moving on to 13.I was reading the reviews before choosing this course, and one of those complained about this being Latin American Spanish rather than European Spanish. For me this is an advantage: my goal is to be able to communicate with locals and personal during our vacations to places like Mexico or Dominican Republic. I was surprised with how perfectly the program fits the goal. Dialogs concentrate on general courtesy, saying basic things about yourself, finding your way around, social eating and drinking, buying thins, timing, counting... It feels like the material was compiled with somebody exactly like me in mind: the phrase \\"One beer, please\\" is introduced as early as Lesson 5, if I remember correctly.

I spoke no Spanish before these 16 lessons. I would say I got about as much out of this series as I could have reasonably expected. There are 8 CDs with 16 lessons--30 minutes each. The method is totally hearing-based, meaning there is no written content. One learns to recognize words by their sounds. I am a very visual learner, but I have been surprised how well this audio-only system worked for me. These 16 lessons cover the words and grammar one might use to address basic functions of a foreign-speaking visitor. The lessons do not cover past and future tenses of verbs and teach very little about plural nouns.

Each lesson is a track so you can't stop in the middle of the lesson."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I have wanted to learn Spanish for some time but did not want to have to sit (all the time) in front of a computer. So the 30 minute lessons on the Pimsleur CD work very well for me as I listen to them during my 30 minute ride to work every morning. I am up to lesson 23 and I typically listen to the CD (i.e. interact with the CD) about 5 to 10 times before moving on. It is recommended by Pimsleur to move on when you have 80% comprehension and I typically listen to the CD more than would be under this recommendation and move on when I get bored with the lesson. If you are much brighter than me likely you can move at a faster pace. So after 7 months and 23 lessons what are my conclusions?First, although the lessons have given me a good sense of Spanish I am not comfortable speaking Spanish. I have no real opportunity to speak with a native speaker. The lessons start with a conversation but I find it hard to understand (hear) all of the words although I can get a sense of the conversation. At about lesson 18 I went to a Spanish \\"meet up\\" in downtown Chicago. A \\"meet up\\" is sort of like an impromptu group where one can speak Spanish. The result of the \\"meet up\\" was to indicate to me that I was clueless!Second, there is limited vocabulary but these are only 30 minute lessons. Regardless there is ample opportunity to pick up vocabulary elsewhere. Remember what is given to you is BASIC SPANISH. For example, after 23 lessons I likely can order a beer (cerveza), milk (leche) or water (agua). A stirred martini with an olive and a twist of lemon is well beyond me.Third, under this method you are supposed to pick up the language as a child does by just listening. In a sense it works but as an older adult it does not happen very quickly (mucho rapido). As a learning theory it sounds great but in reality for most people (and certainly for me) - not quite.Fourth, I wanted to be able to understand the Spanish Soap Operas that are on the TV Stations in Chicago so that I could practice my listening skills. After 7 months and 23 lessons I am able to pick out individual words but rarely do I get a sense of what is going on (except for intimate scenes for which I do not need Pimsleur!).Fifth, with the CD I can't rewind to go back to those areas in each lesson where I am weak to concentrate on those areas. Not a big deal but annoying to have to listen to the whole CD to get to the part where I need to concentrate.Sixth, I think that Pimsleur is more geared to Spain Spanish rather than Latin American Spanish although this in and of itself is not a big deal. For example, they have you substitute \\"Castillano\\" in place of \\"Espanol\\".As I have been using Pimsleur I have looked at other Spanish language programs for both in person (class) and on line. I have decided not to enroll in a class due to the expense and the time commimtment. The on-line programs (i.e. Rocket Spanish or Rosetta Stone) are slick and for Rosetta Stone a bit expensive. What seems to be helpful to me is to do lessons with Spanish Dictionary which is a free Spanish leaning site on line which has many of the same interactive resources as Rosetta Stone and some others. Rosetta Stone apparently gives you the ability to be on line live with a native speaker that I think would be a terrific feature. So I am now continueing with Pimsleur in my car every morning and running through the lessons on Spanish Dictionary as time permits. I plan to purchase the next Pimsleur Spanish CD (lessons 31-60) when I am about finished with the first set (1-30).The other advantage of Spanish Dictionary in the teacher (Perilee Whitmeyer) who I am now in love with. If anyone knows Perilee let her know. There is much more to say (mucho mas!) but I likely have bored you enough. El SenorSpanish I - 2nd Rev.

I count him as one of the instructors that have fueled a passion in me to study the civil war period. Unlike the previous reviewer, I have had the benefit of having read this book before offering an opinion. Prof. Paluden offers an extremely well researched account of the civil war presidency of Lincoln. This work includes statistics and facts you simply cannot get from documentaries or other accounts. He correctly paints Lincoln as a master politician and cuts through the mythology of the man. Was Lincoln morally opposed to slavery...yes. Was he willing to run on an abolitionist platform?? Hell no, not and get elected during that time period. Paluden's real gift is painting a picture of the period and making folks realize just how important politics was in the 19th Century to all Americans (80-90% voter turnout). Unlike the previous reviewer, I have never noted the negative side of Prof. Paluden. He does have an ego, but, like has been said of his subject \\"no great man was ever modest\\".

Risha (Industrial statistics working paper)","review":"As the title indicates, this is not a biography of Abraham Lincoln. It is, instead, a narrow, but detailed and incisive study of Lincoln's exercise of executive power between his election in 1860 and his assassination in 1865. This is important because, as author Philip Shaw Paludan explains: &quot;No president had larger challenges than Abraham Lincoln.&quot; And Paludan proceeds to state the obvious, that Lincoln was &quot;responsible for two enormous accomplishments that are part of folk legend as well as fact. He saved the Union and he freed the slaves.&quot; No other president did so much in so little time, and Paludan explains why. As a result, within its limited confines, this book is excellent!Paludan demonstrates in the chapter entitled &quot;Assembling the Cast: Winter 1860-61,&quot; that Lincoln, as president-elect, was a shrewd politician. According to Paludan: &quot;Lincoln could be effective only if he unified the six-year-old Republican party,&quot; so one of his first appointments was &quot;his strongest party rival,&quot; William Seward, Senator from New York, as secretary of state. As political payback for delivering Pennsylvania to the Republicans in 1860, Lincoln was obliged to appoint the notoriously-corrupt Simon Cameron Secretary of War. To counter that stench, Lincoln named as his secretary of the navy Connecticut newspaper editor Gideon Welles, who &quot;had a glowing reputation for honesty.&quot; Within a year, Cameron also proved to be incompetent, and, in 1862, Lincoln replaced him with Edwin Stanton, who proved to be not only a man of great integrity but a very capable manager as well. It proved to be one of the most talented cabinets in American history, although Paludan makes clear that its operations were not always harmonious, most notably during the &quot;cabinet crisis&quot; of December 1862.With most of the executive departments in capable hands, Lincoln &quot;involved himself actively in matters of strategy,&quot; claiming &quot;\`war power' authority to use his office to the limits.&quot; Lincoln's focus on military affairs was essential because the Civil War generally went badly for the Union for the first year. Paludan ably demonstrates that even while Lincoln struggled to find generals who had both the talents and temperament to be successful, the Union was &quot;forging the resources of war,&quot; which eventually proved decisive. Gen. George McClellan was a brilliant military administrator but proved much too cautious in the field, appalled by the &quot;mangled corpses and the poor suffering wounded. Lincoln eventually lost confidence in McClellan, and he had to be replaced. One of McClellan's eventual successors, Gen. George Meade, won the great victory at Gettysburg in July 1863, but the Union did fully gain the initiative in the field until Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who won an equally great victory at Vicksburg, Mississippi almost on the same day, was appointed general in chief in March 1864.Lincoln's original war aim was merely to restore the Union. But the costs, human and material, of the war's first two years, made eradication of slavery a necessity. Following the battle of Antietam in September 1862, which was a &quot;tactical draw but a strategic victory&quot; for the Union, Lincoln announced the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. The issue then became: What was to be done with the former slaves? In December, Lincoln proposed a constitutional amendment for the federal government to pay to colonize any blacks who wished to emigrate, but blacks &quot;rejected it, abolitionists had condemned it,&quot; and this &quot;doubtful solution&quot; was beyond the practical realities of the time. Even while the war continued to rage, the prospective problems of reconstruction never were far from Lincoln's mind, and, according to Paludan, this difficult issue increasingly divided the president from radical Republicans.Paludan writes that, while the radicals favored confiscation of land which had prospered from slave labor, Lincoln believed in &quot;peaceful, gradual, compensated emancipation.&quot; Lincoln opposed the harsh remedy of confiscation and believed that the Constitution permitted him to free the slaves only &quot;in places where war was being made.&quot; The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 potentially freed 3 million slaves but did not mention colonization or compensated emancipation. Nevertheless, the emancipation issue proved controversial. Solidly Republican New England remained largely committed to the war, but, according to Paludan: &quot;Especially in the regions of the Middle West settled from the South and in cities where job competition existed between the races, people resented the idea of fighting in order to free blacks.&quot;Equally controversial was the Emancipation Proclamation's &quot;arming of black freedom fighters.&quot; According to Paludan, &quot;Lincoln and his party clearly were committed to Union and to emancipation and to the belief that the two were linked indissolubly by the need for black soldiers.&quot; Almost 180,000 black troops were serving in Union armies by the end of the war. Lincoln was very conscious of the importance of maintaining the national moral, and, in Paludan's view, northern whites increasingly recognized the benefits of having black soldiers defend the Union.According to Paludan, the Union's victory was in large part a result of Lincoln's &quot;devotion to and mastery of the political-constitutional institutions of his time.&quot; Some Civil War buffs and many general readers are likely to find this book rather dry because it focuses on the science of politics. But, as Paludan writes, the preservation of the Union &quot;was achieved chiefly through an extraordinary outreach of national authority.&quot; This book is an exceptionally thoughtful account of the exercise of executive power during the most serious crisis in American history."},{"Title":"A comparison of the \\"Origin of movement\\" series and the \\"Exports from manufacturing establishments\\" series / by Michael P.

It is not as strong as others in the series, but it is still very good. Lincoln's administration was facing very complex times. There is little doubt as to whether that is the case. The Civil War as well as more traditional governmental problems needed to be addressed. The main problem with this book is that it focused too much on the administration of the war, to the detriment of other topics. Other issues, although less public than the war, needed to be dealt with if Lincoln was to be successful. These issues are kept in the shadows, which is problematic because there are other works covering lincoln's administration of the war. At any rate, a solid treatment of Lincoln's administration."},{"Title":"A comparison of the \\"Origin of movement\\" series and the \\"Exports from manufacturing establishments\\" series / by Michael P. Risha (Industrial statistics working paper)","review":"Paludan provides an excellent overview of the Lincoln administration. Beginning with the obvious, he notes that \\"No president had larger challenges than Abraham Lincoln,\\" and that Lincoln met those challenges with two \\"enormous accomplishments,\\" saving the Union and freeing the slaves.Paludan recounts Lincoln's efforts to create a cabinet and harness the talents of its disparate individuals, the challenge of leading the largest war effort in the nation's history to that point and of finding military officers who could carry the war to a successful conclusion.The author argues that the goals of saving the Union and freeing the slaves were inextricably linked in Lincoln's mind and he demonstrates how the President utilized his great political skills and his power as an orator to secure these objectives, often working against what seemed like very long odds.Without Abraham Lincoln, it is entirely possible that the United States would have shattered irreparably in the 1860s, with unimaginable consequences for the people who would later inhabit the North American continent and the world beyond. Looking back with the perspective of 145 years, we take for granted the rise of the United States to the pre-eminent position it holds in the world today. Phillip Shaw Paludan reminds us that, but for Abraham Lincoln, it might never have happened."},{"Title":"A comparison of the \\"Origin of movement\\" series and the \\"Exports from manufacturing establishments\\" series / by Michael P. Risha (Industrial statistics working paper)","review":"When a good friend died his wife gave me his collection of books on the Civil War. Over the years, I have ebayed most of them, but some how, I could not bring myself to auction this book off. During a recent move, as I was packing my library, I toss this book aside to read. Wow! What a good read. Although written ten years ago, this book is strangely appropriate for our times.Lincoln has taken a hit from the politically correct revisionist historians on two accounts: First because of his early stance on resolving the race issue (colonization), and secondly because of the limited reach of the Emancipation Proclamation (freeing only slaves in the states in active rebellion against the Union). For these reasons, modern revisionist judge Lincoln according to modern liberal standards and find him guilty of racism. Unfortunately, history is not that simple. People, at least intelligent people as Lincoln certainly was, have complex and evolving views of the critical issues of their day. Lincoln certainly did not have the hindsight that today's historians do. He was a man of his time who struggled with the issues and whose changing views on race made him a great man. It is to Paludan's credit that he refuses to give simple answers to explain the life and views of a very complex man. He shows us a complex even contradictory personality.Especially pertinent to the current news is Paludan's analysis of Lincoln and the Supreme Court. Lincoln believed that ultimate authority in the issues before the nation was the political process, not the Supreme Court (i.e., the Dred Scott decision). Social policy was not the realm of the court, but of the congress. Lincoln saw the court having authority only on parties to the suit and perhaps as a precedent in parallel cases. But \\"upon vital questions affecting the whole people\\" American citizens could not \\"resign their government into the hands of judges.\\" The same issue faces us today. The fundamental question we are facing is the same Lincoln faced: Is the role of the court to adjudicate constitutional issues or to decide social policy?Vital to Lincoln's perception of the role of the Supreme Court was his view of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. He saw the Declaration as the promise and the Constitution as the incomplete fulfillment of that promise. The inclusion of slavery into the Constitution was a political necessity to form the union (six slave states would not enter the union without it). Thus Dread Scott was the wrong decision, immoral as it were, even if the constitution included slavery. Why? Because the promise was given in the Declaration of Independence that all men were created equal. Hum . . . funny thing, when today's conservatives cite the Declaration of Independence in defense of a theistic basis for our nation, liberals are quick to point out that the Declaration is not a legal document and that the Constitution, as the ultimate authority, does not mention God at all. Just a thought.Ok, I can't help it. I have to talk about the anti-war Democrats of Lincoln's day. Paludan points out again and again that the Democrats of Lincoln's day kept up a constant litany that the war could not be won, that it would bankrupt the county, and that civil liberties were threatened. The peace activist of that day saw nothing but failure and thought that recognizing that failure made better sense than perpetuating it. Um. . . sounds familiar doesn't it. I guess some things never change.Well, I guess I said enough. This was a great book. I could hardly put it down. Good thing I did not ebay it."},{"Title":"A comparison of the \\"Origin of movement\\" series and the \\"Exports from manufacturing establishments\\" series / by Michael P. Risha (Industrial statistics working paper)","review":"This is not a bad book, and in fact offers a solid description and assessment of the Lincoln Administration.Paludan describes the working of Lincoln's government well, including the personalities and major policy issues they faced. He does a good job in explaining the manueverings between Salmon P. Chase and Lincoln for dominance of the Administration and later for the 1864 Repbulican Party nomination. Also described thoroughly is Lincoln's Louisianna reconstruction plan, which gives a pretty plausible map to what reconstruction could have looked like had Booth not intervened.I found the writing average. While the book explains the subject well enough, the prose is more workmanlike. It didn't reach the level of engrossing style other chronicler's of Lincoln and his government have.Overall, not bad."},{"Title":"A comparison of the \\"Origin of movement\\" series and the \\"Exports from manufacturing establishments\\" series / by Michael P. Risha (Industrial statistics working paper)","review":"Well, first of all, I must tell everyone that I probably have a negative bias towards this book's author. The best thing I can say of this book is that curling up with it is much more pleasant than being in the same county as the author and his enormous ego. His scholarship in the book is a lot sounder than his verbal musings in the classroom, many of which are non-sensical and poorly thought-out, and his modern political musings which are often inappropiate and non-germane. One of my fondest memories is of him being made a fool of by a freshman student when he lectured for an hour on why a funeral home is called a &quot;home&quot;. In typical PS Paludan fashion, he constructed an elaborate 19th century socio-historical explanation for what was easily explained by the student. They are called &quot;funeral homes&quot; because they were in caretaker's houses! Yes, Philly has a way of making the simple hard. This man almost ruined me on the study of history. I obviously would never buy this book, as I wouldn't want to see a penny go to this conceited egotist. I had this guy for a course 2 years ago and the mention of his name still makes my blood boil."},{"Title":"He's All That: Men To Do (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Rich girls do it best! At least, that's how Victoria Whitford's selling it.

And she's got the Man To Do all primed and ready - the gardener's son. She's beenhaving this fantasy since she was sixteen. Now Tori's up for the sexual challenge...

How long will he have before daddy's little rich girl talls him: time's up?"},{"Title":"Hellsing, Vol. 4","review":"Hellsing is already a masterwork, (albeit one in progress,) and volume four, as with all of the other volumes of the manga that have come before, seems to be no different. Hirano has outdone himself yet again, and proven, also yet again, that his style, like a fine wine, only gets better with age.As with any manga series, I recommend you start with the first volume, (in order to maintain the story's general coherency and provide a more enjoyable experience overall,) but if you've already read through volume three, then this book is a definite must have! The artwork is excellent to say the least; Hirano's style has certainly come a long way since the previous three mangas! His work in Volume four is far more refined, and the storyline progresses in an adrenaline choked suspense ride jam-packed with the kind of gore and gothic crusaderism we've come to expect from Hirano. Again, a definite must have for any fan of Hellsing!"},{"Title":"Hellsing, Vol. 4","review":"This is in fact the best one by far (it is also one of the only ones that there is cussing in, despite Hellsing's outward, violent appearance). I am actually 15 years old, but due to complications I wound up in the 13 and under review department. So here I am to tell you of the wonders of Hellsing vol. 4 by Kouta Hirano. The series overall is excellent. The drawings are detailed and inky, almost every page has a smattering of blood but its something you come to expect in a tale of vampiric, Nazi mayhem. The characters in this series are excellent and well-portrayed, and the vampire Alucard is a character of many layers and shades; quite intriguing. The story is well-developed and the charcters help push it along. This is a must-read for all vampire fans out there, and I know there are plenty. But this is by far...no tale for the weak of heart...or...stomach for that matter."},{"Title":"Hellsing, Vol. 4","review":"The plot is just getting better and better!Great artwork and awsome gorey scences.It's every vampire fans' dream!There are more characters now but you get the feeling theyre not permanent. But God, this book is great."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"\\"The Brotherhood of War\\" series is really six books, beginning in 1944 with \\"The Lieutenants\\" and ending in 1970 with \\"The Generals.\\" This book, though nominally #7 in the series, is (like \\"The Aviators,\\" nominally #8) not so much a part of the series as a stand-alone adjunct to it. Major characters from the first six books (Craig Lowell, Sandy Felter) are supporting characters here, and the focus is on characters that didn't exist (or received limited attention) in the main series.One happy result of this is that, although \\"The New Breed\\" *can* be read as part of the original series (Note: Descriptions of it as a \\"prequel\\" to \\"The Generals\\" notwithstanding, it's really read better *after* that book) it also works perfectly well as a stand-alone novel. Fans of the series will see dimensions in the Craig Lowell/Geoff Craig relationships that first-timers won't, but those nuances aren't critical to enjoying the story.The story proper is about U. S. Army intervention in the former Belgian Congo during its post-independence civil war . . . an aspect of the Cold War that most Americans know about only from an old Tom Lehrer lyric about making peace \\"the way we did in Stanleyville and Saigon.\\" Griffin makes good use of the post-colonial setting, and Col. Michael \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare, a famous leader of mercenaries in the real world, makes a credible supporting character. The three leading fictional characters, Karl-Heinz Wagner, Geoffrey Craig, and Jacques \\"Jack\\" Portet are all drawn well enough to be interesting, and Griffin uses Wagner (an East German defector) and Portet (a Belgian-American airline pilot who gets drafted) to say some thoughtful things about loyalty and cultural differences.What really makes a novel like this stand or fall, however, is the quality of the plot, and here (perhaps sensing that he's writing a stand-alone story) Griffin does better than usual at creating a story arc that lasts through the whole book, ties the characters together, and comes to a satisfying conclusion.This is (like Griffin's other books) more a \\"military procedural\\" than a slam-bang, shoot-em-up \\"war story.\\" That may disappoint some readers (try Wilbur Smith's \\"Dark of the Sun\\" or \\"Cry Wolf\\") but it's true to the characters and material in a way that extravagant violence wouldn't be. Recommended"},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"I have being reading all of Griffin's books since he came out with the Lts. He has several series. Brotherhood of War is about the Army from World War II to near the end of Vietnam war. The Marines is about World War ll up to Korea. The Police series is about the Philadelphia Police in the 60's, the OSS series is World War II mostly in China, and the newest series is about the secret service.Even though he turns out series by the pound, each book stands on its own. The best part of all his books is the charicter studies. The background story is there only to improve the characters. These are the kind of books that you pick up and don't put down until they are done. You feel you know the people in the books and they are no longer fiction. These books get dog eared fast, because you will reread them often. Each time you read them you will find out something you missed the time before. Pick up all of his writings."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"I bought the whole series years ago, sold them on e-bay, and now my wife is reading them. We had to purchase them all over again. Great series of books. Great author who keeps you interested throughout. I just might re-read them myself. They are fast \\"reads.\\" Exciting, and although W.E.B. Griffin writes with authority, some of his technical jargon is a bit phony and errors do occasionally show up. I forgive him. I especially noted this with Weather reports and control tower jargon, having worked for thirty-seven years in that field. Griffin could use a better editor to eliminate some of those errors. His earlier books contain some sex scenes which don't feel natural and they were unnecessary as well. Ten books into his writting, he no longer writes these uncomfortable and unnecessary scenes. None-the-less, these are all great books and good reading and now with about 30 titles completed, one can expect to spend a long time consuming his tales. I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"This a good book in the series that follows fictional charaters while laced with factual data regarding conflicts of nations during war and peace."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"I've enjoyed W.E.B. Griffin's books over the years but I'm none too sure of this or any of his newer books in the series (after the Colonels). While it's fiction and Griffin is allowed to rewrite history but it's annoying when he rewrites his own fictional history. Case in point, long time readers know how Craig Lowell received his promotion to Lieutenant so that he could play polo just after WWII. Yet in this book we're told that he received it as a battlefield commission in Greece. It's as good a read as any of the other books he's written but it seems he wasn't paying a lot of attention to his own source material while writing it."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"Great book.

I have read many of these books starting with the first during the years prior to WWII and following through Vietnam. I am still reading and since I don't read everyday it has taken me about 2 years to get half way through. I like how Griffin takes history and makes it a fiction."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"I purchased and have read and enjoyed the entire Brotherhood series. Griffin is awesome. His storytellling prowess and skill at bringing characters to life is second to none.I spent 21 years in the Army and I met many of his characters in my travels and work. He does a super job and I recommend his work. The editor should be chastised for some poor effort in polishing the final effort, and for that I give four stars to the whole series.The storytelling and characters therein clearly deserve five stars!"},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"The fast paced and realistic excitment makes this perhaps the very best of the series yet. There seems an enhanced magic to the characters and their interrelationship that makes one feel a part of the book while reading. I could not put it down -- reading it is almost an emotional rollercoaster."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"Having spent time in the Marines this was a great read. Then it is fiction based on some historical facts. Not every one is a real Army guy and don't think it's like this."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"The New Breed, The Aviators, and Special Ops is one story. As a Vietnam Vet I identify with Father. And Doubting and John Oliver. This is Web Griffin at his best and every soldier who fought and survived should be able to relive the long nights when every noise caused the spincter to clinch. And that elation when the pilot came over the PA and told us we had cleared Vietnam airspace. And then the rage when those commie sonsofbitches spit at us and called us murderers. It was just luck on their part we had been disarmed at Saigon. I still feel the shame that MPs kept me from wading into that crowd and beating them all to death."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"Typical Griffin Style - Filled with people, places and events.

Maybe it's good if you are a new reader of Griffin's works and need the background, but for someone who has read several of his previous novels, the plots are similar and a frustrating amount of content summarizes previous novels in the storyline."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"This work by WEB Griffin and his son was a page turner that I couldn't put down.

When Junior started cowriting, I had serious doubts and, of course voiced them, but he seems to have gotten into the groove. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"the New Breed","review":"This series is still nothing more than an Army soap opera, but this particular book is saved from my fiercer wrath because it deals with one of my own personal areas of intrest (the Cold War as it effected sub-Saharan Africa) which is usually unreported and ignored. At least Griffin put the effort in to know the background and some of the players involved in the chaotic atmosphere that was post-colonial Africa, even if the story is as syrupy as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"In Peril: A Daring Decision, a Captain's Resolve, and the Salvage that Made History","review":"I love books like this, any adventure against good old mother nature with a significant amount of danger and big machines tossed in for effect. That is why I thought I would love this book. I did enjoy it and I found that I learned a great deal about everything from the NASA Space Shuttle to oil tanker operations. I also got a good dose of what it is like to be in the merchant marine. The issue I had with the book is that I did not think it lived up to the description on the dust jacket. I thought there would be far more \\"seconds away from death\\" type adventure.The book covers the three days period of time when an oil tanker came to the rescue of a tug boat pulling an external fuel tank for the shuttle during a topical storm. Sure it sounds like an odd bunch of vehicles, but that adds to the charm of the story. That sounds like some excitement and to be fair the book did have a good amount, but perfect storm it was not. I just thought that outside of a large monetary loss, the outcome of the rescue had it not worked would have been only property damage to one specialized gas tank. I was just expecting and I guess looking for more excitement. To give the book credit though it was interesting and had exciting parts. It just was not a top tier nail biter type book."},{"Title":"In Peril: A Daring Decision, a Captain's Resolve, and the Salvage that Made History","review":"This is a gripping story of the voyage of a tanker and a tug that came together to make history.
